### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conjecture formalizing a trade-off between provable correctness and data-mapping capacity in AI, highlights its implications for evaluation and governance, and stresses the need to prove or refute the conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the implicit trade-off in AI systems between achieving error-free outputs in narrowly-defined tasks and handling complex data, which often involves intrinsic error risks.

Method: The paper introduces an information-theoretic conjecture and contextualizes it within various disciplines, then analyzes its implications through philosophical and practical lenses.

Result: The analysis reveals how the conjecture could influence standards for evaluating trustworthy AI, affect governance related to AI, and guide hybrid system designs.

Conclusion: If proved true, the conjecture would significantly shape future AI development and philosophical perspectives, underscoring the need for rigorous verification or refutation.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the need for medical foundation models capable of dynamic context-switching to address contextual errors and improve adaptability in varied and evolving clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models struggle to adapt to new specialties, populations, or clinical situations without retraining, leading to contextual errors in patient-specific care.

Method: The paper proposes a vision for context-switching in medical AI models that adapt dynamically across evolving contexts without the need for fine-tuning, retrieval, or specific prompting.

Result: Dynamic context-switching AI promises broader applicability in diagnosing, managing, and treating diseases across diverse clinical roles and global regions.

Conclusion: Context-switching in medical AI could revolutionize healthcare by providing flexible, accurate, and patient-specific assistance across diverse and changing medical contexts.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [LogiPlan: A Structured Benchmark for Logical Planning and Relational Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10527)
*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan is a benchmark to test large language models (LLMs) on logical planning and relational reasoning through three types of tasks, revealing performance gaps based on model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and understand the performance of LLMs in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures crucial for applications like knowledge bases and business schema.

Method: LogiPlan is designed with three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question. Complexity levels are dynamically varied, and models are also evaluated for self-correction capabilities.

Result: Performance evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art models shows that recent reasoning-enhanced models perform well on simpler tasks but struggle on more complex logical problems.

Conclusion: LogiPlan highlights significant model performance gaps, indicating that current LLMs need improvements in managing deeper and more complex logical planning challenges.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [4] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines causation vs. correlation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, employing machine learning and statistical approaches to identify impactful features on AD classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between causal factors and correlated markers in Alzheimer's disease, improving diagnosis and treatment.

Method: Correlation analysis, XGBoost classification, and SHAP interpretability are used to analyze clinical, genetic, and biomarker data.

Result: Key features influencing AD classification, such as cognitive scores and genetic risks, were identified alongside insights into the contributions of correlated variables.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes careful interpretation of correlations and sets a foundation for future causal inference studies, aiming for better diagnosis and interventions in AD.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [5] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores advancements in safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability for trustworthy AI systems, including shields for safety and fairness, metrics for assessing agent intentions, and a unified framework for reactive decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI increasingly influencing critical sectors, ensuring responsible and trustworthy AI systems has become crucial.

Method: The paper extends deterministic shielding techniques, simulates fairness shields for decision-making, introduces metrics for evaluating intentionality, and aligns these improvements under a unified reactive decision-making framework.

Result: Validated safety shields in autonomous driving scenarios, introduced fairness shields optimizing intervention costs, developed intention metrics, and created a cohesive framework for trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: The contributions enhance practical deployment of safer, fairer, and accountable AI systems, paving the way for advancements in trustworthy AI research.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [6] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WGSR-Bench, a novel strategy reasoning benchmark designed to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) strategic thinking using wargames as a testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic reasoning, an essential aspect of human cognition like multi-agent planning and adaptive strategies, is underexplored in evaluating LLMs.

Method: The paper utilizes wargames, modeling complex strategic scenarios, and focuses on three tasks—situation awareness, opponent modeling, and strategy generation (S-POE architecture) to evaluate LLMs.

Result: WGSR-Bench provides a systematic evaluation framework for LLMs, emphasizing challenges in strategic reasoning like decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench aims to push forward LLM-driven strategic intelligence research by highlighting capabilities and gaps in LLMs' strategic reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [7] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reframes AI as a cognitive revolution that complements human intellect, heralding a transformative productivity paradigm distinct from prior industrial advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to contextualize AI's role, proposing it as a pivotal force driving cognitive productivity, akin to how written language transformed human knowledge.

Method: The authors compare historical technological leaps with AI's emergence, employ examples from various domains, and integrate computer science, economic, and sociological perspectives to develop conceptual frameworks.

Result: AI is portrayed as an engine of cognition that enhances knowledge work and reshapes productivity paradigms and societal structures.

Conclusion: AI offers transformative potential by augmenting human cognitive abilities, necessitating a reevaluation of skills, organizations, and policies for effective adoption.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [8] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies computational complexity barriers when verifying AI safety, showing that safety verification becomes infeasible as AI systems scale in capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the computational limits of verifying AI safety as system capabilities grow, given the increasing societal demand for nearly perfect safety systems.

Method: Through a formal, complexity-theoretic framework, the authors develop four key theorems analyzing the scaling relationship between AI capabilities, safety requirements, and computational intractability.

Result: The authors prove that verification complexity rises exponentially with system expressiveness, safe policies form a vanishingly small fraction of the space, alignment techniques cannot universally ensure safety, and robust safety properties are computationally rare for neural networks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that scaling AI capabilities creates an unavoidable trade-off, requiring choices between constraining system complexity, accepting risks, or devising entirely new safety paradigms.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [9] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for studying multi-agent learning in Pokémon VGC, a domain with a massive combinatorial strategy space. While some methods succeed in restricted settings, generalizing strategies to broader team configurations remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of developing AI agents capable of robustly adapting to changing strategic landscapes, particularly in complex multi-agent environments like Pokémon VGC, which has a combinatorial strategy space of unprecedented scale.

Method: The authors created VGC-Bench, which offers infrastructure, standardized evaluation protocols, human-play datasets, and various AI baselines (e.g., LLM agents, behavior cloning, reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic methods). They evaluated methods across increasingly larger team sets to test generalization and adaptability.

Result: In a restricted setting, certain methods were able to beat a professional Pokémon VGC competitor using a specific team configuration. However, when scaling the strategies to accommodate diverse team configurations, the methods struggled significantly.

Conclusion: While the VGC-Bench benchmark shows promise in advancing AI applied to multi-agent strategic environments, policy generalization across diverse configurations remains a key unresolved challenge for the research community.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

### [10] [Optimus-3: Towards Generalist Multimodal Minecraft Agents with Scalable Task Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10357)
*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft, which achieves superior performance by addressing key challenges such as task heterogeneity and visual diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a generalist agent capable of handling perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world settings like Minecraft, overcoming challenges like limited domain-specific data and task interference.

Method: The paper introduces three contributions: a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for heterogeneous task handling, and a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for addressing visual diversity.

Result: Optimus-3 demonstrated superior performance to both generalist MLLMs and state-of-the-art agents across various Minecraft tasks.

Conclusion: The innovations presented successfully establish Optimus-3 as an effective and general-purpose agent for the Minecraft environment, solving key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

### [11] [NeuroPAL: Punctuated Anytime Learning with Neuroevolution for Macromanagement in Starcraft: Brood War](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10384)
*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPAL, which combines NEAT and PAL for efficient learning in the StarCraft: Brood War game, achieving competitive strategies in half the training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency of existing AI methods for StarCraft, particularly in macromanagement, long-term strategy planning.

Method: They used NeuroPAL, a framework combining NEAT with PAL, alternating between low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations to improve training efficiency.

Result: NeuroPAL significantly speeds up learning, enabling agents to reach competitive play with half the training time of NEAT. It also induces emergent expert strategies like proxy barracks placement.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can improve the scalability and success of neuroevolution frameworks in complex strategy games.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mirage-1, a hierarchical multimodal GUI agent, to address knowledge gaps and domain challenges in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language model (MLLM) agents struggle with long-horizon tasks, mainly due to insufficient knowledge and the offline-to-online domain gap.

Method: The authors devised the Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module for structured knowledge and the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm for efficient task planning, bridging offline and online environments.

Result: Experimental results exhibit substantial improvements, with Mirage-1 surpassing prior agents by 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% in multiple benchmarks, including AndroidLH.

Conclusion: Mirage-1 demonstrates superior performance as a cross-platform GUI agent in tackling real-world, long-horizon tasks through efficient skill structuring and domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

### [13] [Reasoning RAG via System 1 or System 2: A Survey on Reasoning Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Industry Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10408)
*Jintao Liang,Gang Su,Huifeng Lin,You Wu,Rui Zhao,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews an advanced form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) called Reasoning Agentic RAG, which enhances reasoning, retrieval, and tool integration for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning Agentic RAG emerged due to the limitations of earlier RAG models, which faced challenges in real-world scenarios requiring dynamic retrieval, complex reasoning, and multi-modal data integration.

Method: The paper categorizes Reasoning Agentic RAG into predefined reasoning systems with fixed pipelines and agentic reasoning systems allowing autonomous decision-making during tool interaction. It evaluates their designs, reasoning methods, and coordination strategies.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the two RAG paradigms and compiles relevant research into a GitHub repository for further exploration.

Conclusion: Reasoning Agentic RAG systems have the potential to improve flexibility and robustness in real-world applications, but significant research challenges remain to be addressed for their advancement.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

### [14] [Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420)
*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agent-based framework for dynamic autoscaling in edge computing environments, comparing four types of agents to optimize resource allocation and service configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing demands flexible scaling due to strict resource constraints, requiring new methods for autoscaling beyond traditional paradigms.

Method: This study deploys four agent-based autoscaling strategies—Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference—to adapt hardware and service configurations in real-time.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable Service Level Objective (SLO) performance, with Deep Q Network benefiting from pre-training, structural analysis offering rapid convergence, and deep active inference balancing theoretical and practical advantages.

Conclusion: The multi-dimensional agent-based approach to autoscaling is feasible and effective for edge environments, presenting a strong case for further research and optimization in this field.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OIBench, a challenging dataset for evaluating algorithmic reasoning in models, aiming to improve benchmarks for future model advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning are no longer sufficiently challenging as models improve, necessitating the creation of new, rigorous benchmarks.

Method: The researchers created a private dataset of 250 curated olympiad-level informatics problems, examined contamination resistance, introduced Time/Space Completion Curves, and enabled comparisons with human participants.

Result: Experiments showed open-source models underperformed closed-source ones, and SOTA models surpassed most humans but remained inefficient compared to canonical solutions.

Conclusion: OIBench, now open-source, is positioned as a valuable tool to advance code reasoning in future language models.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately assess MLLMs on perception and reasoning abilities, which are crucial for scientific discovery.

Method: SFE benchmark was developed with 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three levels of evaluation: signal perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art models GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 scored 34.08% and 26.52% respectively on SFE, showcasing performance gaps.

abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%

### [17] [Primender Sequence: A Novel Mathematical Construct for Testing Symbolic Inference and AI Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10585)
*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Primender sequence—a number sequence defined through primes and prime-related suffixes—and uses it to benchmark the symbolic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in symbolic reasoning, emphasizing the importance of interpretable, rule-based approaches to assessing their ability to reason mathematically, infer hidden rules, and generalize logic.

Method: The authors define the Primender sequence by combining primality and specific modular digit-based rules. They then test the hypothesis regarding the sequence's structural properties by designing prompts and evaluation criteria, assessing six state-of-the-art LLMs for their ability to identify rules, validate hypotheses, and extend the sequence.

Result: Key findings include comparative insights into LLM performance across dimensions such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis validation, and sequence prediction validity. Generated sequences and explanations were evaluated for quality.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel benchmark that combines number theory and symbolic reasoning and demonstrates how this benchmark can assess the mathematical and reasoning capabilities of advanced LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

### [18] [Data Driven Diagnosis for Large Cyber-Physical-Systems with Minimal Prior Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10613)
*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic approach for cyber-physical systems that requires minimal prior knowledge, focusing only on subsystem relationships and nominal operation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing complex cyber-physical systems often depends on detailed models or extensive training data, which are hard to acquire.

Method: The paper uses a neural network-based symptom generator for subsystem anomaly detection and a graph diagnosis algorithm leveraging minimal causal relationships.

Result: Experiments show 82% accuracy in identifying the causal component and a 73% reduction in search space. Tests on real-world datasets corroborate the method's practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promise for diagnosing large, complex cyber-physical systems, especially when detailed prior knowledge is unavailable.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleMath, a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving mathematical problems specific to telecommunications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in general mathematical reasoning by LLMs, their effectiveness in specialized fields such as telecommunications remains underexplored.

Method: The authors developed the TeleMath dataset with 500 QnA pairs encompassing a variety of telecommunications topics, generated via a pipeline guided by Subject Matter Experts.

Result: Evaluations indicate that models tailored for mathematical/logical reasoning outperform general-purpose LLMs on the TeleMath dataset.

Conclusion: TeleMath serves as a valuable tool for assessing and improving LLMs in domain-specific mathematical reasoning, with its dataset and evaluation code made publicly available to support ongoing research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

*Tom Westermann,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline to transform informal AML modeling constraints into formal rules using OWL ontologies, SHACL constraints, and NLP tools for interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AML modeling recommendations are informal, making automatic validation impossible within AML.

Method: Develops a pipeline where AML models are converted to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL, applies SHACL constraints generated by LLMs for validation, and interprets results in natural language.

Result: The approach enables semi-automatic validation of complex AML modeling rules without requiring expertise in formal methods or ontologies.

Conclusion: The method facilitates improved AML model verification by automating the formalization and validation of informal modeling rules.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective integration of Answer Set Programming and Satisfiability Modulo Theories, particularly for reasoning tasks involving continuous changes.

Method: Implemented a compiler, 'aspsmt2smt,' which translates ASPMT programs into SMT instances using Gringo for partial grounding and Z3 for subsequent computation.

Result: The system effectively handles real number computations and leverages the strengths of both Gringo and Z3 for solving ASPMT problems.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates successful reasoning about continuous changes by combining ASP and SMT, offering a robust method for dealing with such problems.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhancement for neuro-symbolic models to address counterfactual reasoning challenges in analyzing video dynamics using causal graphs and symbolic reasoning integrated with perception and simulation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuro-symbolic models for video dynamics struggle with counterfactual reasoning due to limitations in addressing causal relations among events.

Method: The approach defines causal graphs to encode event relations and employs Answer Set Programming (ASP) for coordinating perception and simulation modules. It also integrates large pre-trained language models as dynamics simulators in specific benchmarks.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the CLEVRER challenge and shows improved performance on the CRAFT benchmark by utilizing symbolic causal reasoning to inform language model prompts.

Conclusion: Enhancing neuro-symbolic models with causal reasoning and leveraging ASP and language models substantially improves counterfactual reasoning in video dynamics analysis.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Motivation: While LLMs are proficient at solving diverse tasks, their ability to iteratively optimize solutions using feedback remains underexplored. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors developed OPT-BENCH, a benchmark with 30 tasks (20 ML tasks and 10 NP problems), along with OPT-Agent, a framework that uses iterative reasoning to improve solutions using historical feedback.

Result: Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs show that incorporating historical feedback improves optimization performance significantly. The analysis considers optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures.

Conclusion: OPT-BENCH and OPT-Agent provide powerful tools to assess and enhance LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning, with promising results for future advancements in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Model Context Protocol to simulate human spatiotemporal behavior efficiently using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based and statistical methods for human spatiotemporal behavior simulation are computationally expensive, lack generalizability, and scalability, while LLMs face challenges in spatial cognition, physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization.

Method: The framework employs a five-stage cognitive reasoning process combined with six Model Context Protocol categories covering temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.

Result: Experimental validation in Shanghai's Lujiazui district shows high alignment between generated simulations and mobile signaling data, with quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36, and efficiency improvements with generation times reduced from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes using parallel processing.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs for urban behavior modeling while addressing challenges in computational efficiency and spatiotemporal reasoning, contributing practical strategies for applications in urban planning and mobility simulation.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Result: GenPlanX effectively assists users with office-related tasks by interpreting their intents and providing actionable planning solutions.

Conclusion: GenPlanX demonstrates the potential to enhance productivity and streamline workflows through human-AI collaboration, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding in planning tasks.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToxiMol, the first benchmark for using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to repair molecular toxicity, alongside a database and evaluation framework called ToxiEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a systematic definition or benchmark for molecular toxicity repair, which is critical due to the prevalence of toxicity-related failures in early-stage drug development.

Method: Created ToxiMol, a benchmark dataset of 560 toxic molecules across 11 tasks, and designed ToxiEval, an automated framework evaluating molecular repair using criteria like toxicity prediction, drug-likeness, and structural similarity.

Result: Evaluated nearly 30 mainstream MLLMs, showing they face significant challenges but exhibit emerging capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and molecule editing.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs show promise in addressing molecular toxicity issues but require further development to overcome notable limitations in repair success and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to boost mathematical reasoning of models like Qwen2.5-Math-7B, even using spurious rewards. Gains in performance are observed, but they are model-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, particularly RLVR, can improve mathematical reasoning in AI models even when the rewards used are spurious or untrustworthy.

Method: RLVR was applied to several models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3, OLMo2) to test its capability in improving performance under varying reward signal conditions (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, 1-shot RL, etc.). Performance metrics like MATH-500 scores were evaluated.

Result: RLVR led to significant performance improvements for Qwen2.5-Math-7B, even with spurious rewards, increasing the use of code reasoning from 65% to over 90%. However, this improvement did not generalize well to other model families, highlighting model-specific outcomes.

Conclusion: While RLVR can boost reasoning for certain model types, its effectiveness heavily depends on the model architecture and pretraining. Further research is needed to decode the underlying mechanism and to validate RLVR across diverse model families.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CarbonSet, a dataset evaluating the sustainability and performance of CPUs and GPUs, highlighting pressing concerns about rising carbon emissions in modern processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of holistic analysis of the entire chip lifecycle's carbon footprint amidst increasing carbon emissions from expanded chip production.

Method: The authors developed CarbonSet, a dataset aggregating sustainability and performance metrics of CPUs and GPUs over a decade. They used it for detailed analysis of flagship processors' trends.

Result: Analysis revealed that modern processors are unsustainably designed, with carbon emissions increasing over 50 times in the past three years, mainly driven by growing AI application demands.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for sustainable design practices in processors, with a focus on improving power efficiency and addressing challenges in amortizing emissions from advanced manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Over the years, the chip industry has consistently developed high-performance
processors to address the increasing demands across diverse applications.
However, the rapid expansion of chip production has significantly increased
carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability.
While researchers have previously modeled the carbon footprint (CFP) at both
system and processor levels, a holistic analysis of sustainability trends
encompassing the entire chip lifecycle remains lacking. This paper presents
CarbonSet, a comprehensive dataset integrating sustainability and performance
metrics for CPUs and GPUs over the past decade. CarbonSet aims to benchmark and
assess the design of next-generation processors. Leveraging this dataset, we
conducted detailed analysis of flagship processors' sustainability trends over
the last decade. This paper further highlights that modern processors are not
yet sustainably designed, with total carbon emissions increasing more than
50$\times$ in the past three years due to the surging demand driven by the AI
boom. Power efficiency remains a significant concern, while advanced process
nodes pose new challenges requiring to effectively amortize the dramatically
increased manufacturing carbon emissions.

### [29] [EasyDRAM: An FPGA-based Infrastructure for Fast and Accurate End-to-End Evaluation of Emerging DRAM Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10441)
*Oğuzhan Canpolat,Ataberk Olgun,David Novo,Oğuz Ergin,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: EasyDRAM is an FPGA-based framework designed for rapid and accurate evaluation of DRAM techniques, overcoming prior challenges in accessibility and accurate system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the system-wide benefits of DRAM techniques is difficult due to required modifications across multiple computing layers. Existing FPGA-based platforms face accessibility and accuracy challenges.

Method: EasyDRAM uses a high-level language (C++) for DRAM technique implementation and introduces a novel time scaling technique to replicate processor-DRAM interface timing.

Result: EasyDRAM removes hardware language barriers and models modern systems more realistically, enabling precise evaluation of DRAM techniques on real chips.

Conclusion: EasyDRAM enhances the accessibility and fidelity of DRAM evaluation, fostering innovative memory system designs. The framework is open-sourced to aid future research.

Abstract: DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works
propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance
DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing
capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide
benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications
across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based
platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM
chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)
they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting
accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern
computing systems.
  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate
end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes
the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,
EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by
enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language
(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design
in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental
challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically
operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to
replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling
the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel
technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior
of the modeled system.
  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory
system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM
implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.

*Luca Colagrande,Lorenzo Leone,Maximilian Coco,Andrei Deaconeasa,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a microarchitecture for ML accelerators with optimizations for control flow and memory access, achieving significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in control flow and memory access in ML accelerators while maintaining programmability and efficiency.

Method: The authors use optimized microarchitectural techniques: "zero-overhead loop nests" to improve control flow, and a "zero-conflict memory subsystem" to eliminate bank conflicts.

Result: Achieved 11% performance and 8% energy efficiency improvements over a baseline RISC-V cluster, with near-ideal utilization (96.1%-99.4%).

Conclusion: The proposed solution achieves performance and efficiency close to specialized accelerators while remaining programmable and supporting a broader range of workloads.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have
driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between
efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML
accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing
multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for
key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However,
instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations
that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory
access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a
state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we
propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these
inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce
"zero-overhead loop nests" to remove control overheads, and a "zero-conflict
memory subsystem", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to
eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain
near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and
8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We
demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA
accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a
fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider
range of workloads.

*Melina Soysal,Konstantina Koliogeorgi,Can Firtina,Nika Mansouri Ghiasi,Rakesh Nadig,Haiyu Mayo,Geraldo F. Oliveira,Yu Liang,Klea Zambaku,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MARS, a storage-centric system that significantly speeds up raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) by addressing computational and data movement bottlenecks through a novel hardware/software co-design approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in sequencing technology have outpaced the ability of software-based methods to handle RSGA, making I/O data movement the new bottleneck in runtime and energy consumption, thus necessitating a high-performance and energy-efficient solution.

Method: MARS uses a hardware/software co-design with pipeline modifications (filtering and quantization), in-storage processing (Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms), and an orchestration mechanism to optimize execution and minimize data movement.

Result: MARS provides a 93x speedup over software-based pipelines and a 40x improvement over hardware-accelerated alternatives, while also reducing energy consumption by 427x and 72x, respectively.

Conclusion: The system effectively addresses computational and I/O bottlenecks in RSGA, proving its potential for high-throughput, energy-efficient genome analysis.

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.

TL;DR: The paper reviews and categorizes automatic evaluation methods for generative AI outputs across text, images, and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in automatically evaluating generative AI outputs across modalities need addressing due to a lack of systematic frameworks.

Method: The authors present a unified taxonomy and identify five paradigms from a review of existing evaluation methods for text, image, and audio generation.

Result: The taxonomy successfully organizes evaluation methods across these modalities, confirming its extensibility from mature text evaluation techniques to visual and audio domains.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic approach to evaluation, paving the way for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaskCraft, an automated system for generating scalable, complex, multi-tool tasks aimed at improving AI autonomy and problem-solving capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction datasets fail to incorporate tool interaction, and agentic benchmarks are expensive and not scalable, hindering progress in NLP and AI.

Method: TaskCraft employs a workflow that generates difficulty-scalable agentic tasks by expanding atomic tasks into complex challenges through depth-based and width-based extensions.

Result: Empirical findings indicate that tasks created by TaskCraft enhance prompt optimization and supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. A dataset of 36,000 tasks is provided for further research.

Conclusion: TaskCraft offers a practical, scalable solution for developing and evaluating agentic NLP models, promoting advancements in autonomy, reasoning, and tool integration.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [34] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that as semantic expressions grow more complex, interpreting their intended singular meaning becomes computationally intractable for both humans and AI. It finds that meaning is observer-dependent and contextual, suggesting that classical linguistic analysis approaches are lossy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inherent interpretive constraints in natural language posed by semantic degeneracy, which limits both Large Language Models (LLMs) and human interpretation, and to explore a more context-sensitive perspective on linguistic meaning.

Method: The paper leverages Kolmogorov complexity to theorize the vanishing likelihood of recovering single intended meanings as linguistic complexity grows. It conducts a semantic Bell inequality test using LLMs as cognitive systems to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contexts, measuring non-classical contextuality.

Result: The experiments showed CHSH expectation values in the range of 1.2 to 2.8, with violations of the classical boundary (|S| ≤ 2), indicating non-classical contextuality in language interpretation. This aligns with findings from human cognition studies.

Conclusion: The study concludes that meaning in language emerges as an observer-dependent and context-driven phenomenon. Classical frequentist methods are lossy and inadequate for analyzing linguistic meaning, and Bayesian-style approaches are proposed as better alternatives.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) react to semantically equivalent but differently worded prompts, capturing behavioral changes using a proposed framework, PBSS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inconsistent behavior of LLMs in response to slight wording changes of semantically similar prompts, which affects their stability and reliability.

Method: The authors introduce a framework called Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to evaluate and measure how LLM responses change when semantically rephrased prompts are used, applying it to ten specific tasks.

Result: Through PBSS, the study finds that LLMs exhibit consistent, model-specific behavioral changes linked to tokenization and decoding strategies when faced with semantically equivalent prompt variations.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of addressing tokenization and decoding strategies to enhance post-training stability and reliability in LLM performance under prompt rewording.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "ChartReasoner" to enable precise reasoning on visual data, particularly charts, by converting them into structured code and training a multimodal reasoning model using the synthesized dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to extend large language models' reasoning capabilities to visual tasks like chart question answering, where existing methods lose critical visual details during image-to-text transformations.

Method: The proposed method involves a two-stage framework: (1) a transport model to convert chart images into lossless structured codes (ECharts) and, (2) a data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality reasoning trajectories for training via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: ChartReasoner preserves original chart details effectively and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o on varied benchmarks, using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner establishes a pathway to precise, interpretable chart reasoning by maintaining high fidelity of visual data in analysis, achieving efficiency and high performance even in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

TL;DR: The authors propose Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an unsupervised method to fine-tune language models using their own generated labels. It rivals human supervision and excels in leveraging superhuman abilities of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human supervision struggles to define desired behaviors for models with superhuman capabilities, creating a need for unsupervised fine-tuning methods.

Method: Introduce Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an algorithm to fine-tune language models using only their own generated labels without external supervision.

Result: ICM matches the performance of training on golden labels and surpasses crowd-based human-supervised training. It leverages superhuman capabilities more effectively and improves the training of advanced language models.

Conclusion: ICM offers a promising alternative to human supervision for fine-tuning language models, enabling unsupervised training that fully utilizes models' superhuman capabilities.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how well large language models (LLMs) assess empathic communication by comparing their annotations to experts and crowdworkers across four frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the reliability of LLMs in judging the nuances of empathic conversation, as they are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive applications.

Method: The authors evaluate inter-rater reliability using 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations applied to 200 real-world supportive conversations.

Result: Experts show high agreement (varying across frameworks), and LLMs approach expert-level benchmarks and outperform crowdworkers in reliability.

Conclusion: When validated on specific tasks and benchmarks, LLMs can reliably assist in emotionally sensitive applications like conversational companions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

TL;DR: The paper develops a lexicon for human capital (HC) topics using machine learning and provides tools for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human capital is increasingly significant for corporate value, but lacks formal measurement/disclosure standards.

Method: They use a word2vec algorithm trained on HC disclosures to classify HC-related keywords into five subcategories.

Result: They created a HC lexicon, shared corporate disclosures, Python code, and demonstrated its application with BERT models.

Conclusion: The paper offers tools and methodologies for advancing HC-related research and calls for further exploration in this domain.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the story generation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using narrative planning benchmarks, showing strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the story generation capabilities of LLMs by evaluating their performance in solving structured narrative planning problems.

Method: A new benchmark was created that evaluates LLMs based on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Experiments were conducted mainly using GPT-4 tier LLMs.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound short stories but struggle with character intentionality and dramatic conflict, requiring reinforcement learning for advanced reasoning.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the story quality LLMs can achieve and highlights challenges for applying LLMs in narrative planning, especially in game developments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q2E, a method aimed at enhancing text-to-video retrieval by leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the identification and retrieval of videos connected to complex real-world events by harnessing latent parametric knowledge encoded in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Q2E decomposes human queries using the knowledge in LLMs/VLMs, applies entropy-based multimodal fusion scoring, and integrates audio inputs for zero-shot multilingual retrieval.

Result: Evaluations on diverse datasets and metrics show that Q2E outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with audio integration yielding significant benefits.

Conclusion: Q2E enhances understanding and retrieval efficiency for complex queries, showing robust adaptability and effectiveness across inputs, datasets, and domains.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [44] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates large reasoning models (LRMs) on basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning through a new benchmark, TTT-Bench, finding they underperform despite excelling at complex math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reasoning capabilities of LRMs outside the STEM domain through tasks that humans can solve effortlessly, thereby filling a gap in understanding their broader reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors designed TTT-Bench, a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, using a programmatic approach to generate game problems. State-of-the-art LRMs were tested on these games and compared with their performance on established math benchmarks.

Result: The LRMs showed strong performance in complex math benchmarks but experienced a significant performance drop (41% less than MATH 500 and 5% less than AIME 2024) in the simpler TTT-Bench tasks. Struggles were particularly noted in long-term strategic reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: While LRMs are adept at handling complex math problems, their reasoning abilities in simple game tasks requiring basic strategy, spatial understanding, and logical predictions are insufficient, highlighting a limitation in their reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational approach to identify unreliable narrators, supported by TUNa, a dataset across multiple narrative domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the reliability of narrators is crucial for analyzing first-person narratives accurately, especially when information might be unintentionally misrepresented.

Method: The authors developed TUNa, a human-annotated dataset, and proposed tasks to classify varied unreliabilities using LLMs for few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings.

Result: Their experiments with LLMs show that identifying unreliable narrators is a challenging task, although there is potential for improvement.

Conclusion: This research highlights the initial steps in computationally identifying unreliable narrators and encourages further exploration with the released dataset and code.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToxSyn-PT, a large Portuguese corpus for hate-speech classification across nine minority groups, created using a novel, multi-stage generation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for hate-speech detection resources in Portuguese, specifically focusing on underrepresented minority groups and improving generalization beyond social-media contexts.

Method: A four-stage data creation pipeline was designed: (1) seed data collection, (2) expansion using an instruction-tuned language model, (3) paraphrasing for diversity, and (4) enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: The resulting dataset, ToxSyn-PT, is balanced, diverse, and effective in both binary and multi-label hate-speech classification tasks, generalizing well across domain boundaries.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT is publicly available to support research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource languages, addressing domain diversity and resource limitations.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [47] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, revealing that they can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making and proposing methods to address misleading priors during Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether language models possess Bayesian-like probabilistic behavior and improve methods for eliciting their human-like priors.

Method: Analyzed decision-making patterns in a range of large language models under various conditions, particularly through simulated Gibbs sampling experiments.

Result: Identified cases of near-deterministic decision-making in language models even with stochastic sampling parameters, exposing the risk of inferring false priors.

Conclusion: Language model decision-making patterns must be scrutinized to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic behaviors in methods like Gibbs sampling to ensure reliable inference of their priors.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient framework for gradient-based data selection using clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound algorithm, achieving substantial computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently select data samples for fine-tuning large language models without the extensive computational cost of full gradient computation during the process.

Method: The framework clusters data based on gradient similarity and uses a modified Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to allocate computational budgets among clusters, which is treated as a multi-armed bandit problem.

Result: The ClusterUCB framework delivers results comparable to traditional gradient-based methods but with significantly reduced computational requirements, as demonstrated across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB offers a practical and efficient alternative to traditional resource-intensive data selection approaches, making it applicable for large-scale language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [49] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flick, a method designed to improve pseudo-label quality for few-label text classification in low-resource languages via a novel refinement technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-label text classification suffer from errors in pseudo-labels and challenges in domain adaptation, particularly in linguistically diverse, low-resource settings.

Method: Flick refines pseudo-labels by distilling high-confidence clusters, implementing a novel single-cluster cohesion mechanism and an adaptive top-k selection to improve robustness.

Result: Flick outperforms other methods across 14 datasets, including diverse and challenging languages like Arabic, Urdu, Setswana, and English.

Conclusion: Flick shows promise as a robust framework for text classification in low-resource settings, reducing errors from noisy pseudo-labels and effectively fine-tuning pre-trained language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [50] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts, finding that LLM responses are biased based on whether students mention correct or incorrect answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address how sycophantic behavior in LLMs can influence educational equity, helping some students while potentially reinforcing misunderstandings for others.

Method: The authors tested five LLMs from the GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes under five experimental conditions, analyzing response accuracy and token-level probabilities.

Result: Models showed significant variability in correctness based on query framing, with smaller models being more prone to sycophantic bias. LLM accuracy dropped by up to 15% with incorrect inputs and improved by the same margin with correct ones.

Conclusion: Sycophantic bias represents a critical challenge in educational uses of LLMs, necessitating further research into mechanisms and mitigation strategies to ensure equitable learning outcomes.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called scheduled interleaved speech-text training to improve speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address modality adaptation challenges in speech-to-speech translation systems when leveraging LLMs trained on text-only data, particularly with limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: The authors present a training approach where speech and text units are interleaved at the word level. Over time, the ratio of text in the training data is progressively reduced to facilitate smoother adaptation from text to speech.

Result: Experiments conducted via fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B on the CVSS dataset demonstrate consistent improvement in translation performance, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The proposed interleaved training method is effective in improving performance for S2ST tasks, offering promising results for challenging language pairs.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable method to generate high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision datasets for training large language models (LLMs) using program execution instead of costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed method uses program execution to extract step-by-step verifiable reasoning traces and converts these into natural language CoT reasoning, eliminating dependencies on human annotations or LLM-generated CoT.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLMs trained with this method have improved transferable reasoning skills across diverse tasks. Ablation studies confirm the method's accuracy and ability to reduce unnecessary token generation during inference.

Conclusion: The approach successfully provides an accurate, scalable, and efficient way to enhance reasoning abilities of LLMs while minimizing errors and inference inefficiencies.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

*Xiaohan Yu,Pu Jian,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableRAG resolves limitations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for heterogeneous documents, improving reasoning capabilities with an innovative framework and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in current RAG approaches that flatten tabular structures, leading to information loss and impaired reasoning for multi-hop queries over heterogeneous documents.

Method: TableRAG employs a hybrid framework that includes four steps: query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. A new benchmark, HeteQA, is introduced to assess reasoning across textual and tabular data.

Result: TableRAG consistently outperforms existing methods on public datasets and the HeteQA benchmark, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for heterogeneous document question answering.

Conclusion: TableRAG effectively unifies textual and tabular understanding, addressing critical limitations of prior approaches in heterogeneous document contexts. It sets a new benchmark for multi-hop reasoning and demonstrates strong experimental performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

### [54] [PAG: Multi-Turn Reinforced LLM Self-Correction with Policy as Generative Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10406)
*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG) to improve the self-correction ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) via a unified reinforcement learning (RL) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their outputs, which is a challenge for complex reasoning tasks. Existing solutions rely on external verifier models or complicated pipelines, limiting scalability.

Method: The proposed PAG framework alternates LLM roles between policy and verifier using multi-turn reinforcement learning. It employs a selective revision mechanism where the model revises answers only when errors are detected via generative verification.

Result: Experiments demonstrate PAG improves direct generation and self-correction accuracy as a policy, and outperforms self-consistency verification as a verifier.

Conclusion: PAG enhances both reasoning and verification abilities through an efficient verify-then-revise workflow, reducing model collapse and enabling better scalability for self-correction tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in temporal reasoning and grounding abilities of MLLMs and benchmark their performance against new challenges.

Method: Developing the TempVS benchmark consisting of three tests (event relation inference, sentence ordering, and image ordering) along with grounding tests to evaluate MLLMs' multimodal capabilities.

Result: 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs were tested, showing poor performance in comparison to human reasoning on TempVS, indicating a clear gap in current capabilities.

Conclusion: TempVS highlights significant challenges for MLLMs in temporal reasoning, suggesting future research directions and offering publicly available benchmark data and code.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

TL;DR: The study analyzes news media framing during conflicts, focusing on the Israel-Palestine war, using computational methods to identify biases favoring war over peace journalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing studies on media framing during conflicts, which often rely on qualitative methods or surface-level analyses.

Method: Utilizing computational approaches combining frame semantics and large language models to analyze communicative and linguistic framing in news articles.

Result: The study finds that news reporting predominantly focuses on war over peace journalism and reveals significant differences in framing between news outlets from the US, UK, and Middle East.

Conclusion: Media framing can exacerbate conflicts by focusing on war-oriented narratives and showcasing regional biases; computational approaches can offer deeper insights into such dynamics.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLM reasoning by ensuring concise outputs for simpler problems and detailed reasoning for complex ones, achieving better evaluation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning capabilities of LLMs are often hindered by computational latency caused by lengthy outputs, particularly when uniform penalties fail to account for problem complexity.

Method: The authors manage reasoning efficiency by dividing the reward function and incorporating a penalty mechanism for output length, aiming to balance accuracy and conciseness based on problem complexity.

Result: The method demonstrated reduced output lengths with maintained or improved accuracy on simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, and higher accuracy for the more complex AIME2024 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances LLM reasoning efficiency and accuracy, showing promising results across varied benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper addresses claim verification against tables and emphasizes the importance of explanation by identifying key table cells for reasoning. A new dataset with human annotations is introduced to improve performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard claim verification approaches focus solely on predicting labels, lacking insights into the underlying reasoning and interpretability.

Method: The authors extended the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated rationales, developed a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, and conducted experiments incorporating table-cell alignment information.

Result: Incorporating table alignment enhances verification performance. However, large language models (LLMs) often fail to align with human rationale despite predicting correct labels.

Conclusion: Effective reasoning requires models to recover human-aligned rationales, highlighting gaps in LLM's faithful reasoning processes and suggesting a need for improved interpretability.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores bias in large language models (LLMs) through various testing scenarios, uncovering more evident bias in specific contexts like grading user answers or providing salary advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the presence of biases in modern language models, stemming from their training data which includes controversial content and stereotypes.

Method: The researchers analyzed LLM biases using pre-prompted personae, reformulated task approaches (e.g., grading user answers), and practical scenarios like salary negotiation advice.

Result: Findings reveal minimal bias when using pre-prompted personae for general benchmarking, but significant bias emerges in user-specific tasks like grading and salary advice.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges linked to bias in LLMs, particularly with increasing trends in personalization and assistant memory, necessitating further exploration of this issue.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Tina, a highly cost-effective reasoning model that uses reinforcement learning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to achieve competitive performance while significantly reducing post-training computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer how strong reasoning capabilities can be achieved in language models cost-efficiently, and explore ways to reduce the computational cost of reinforcement learning-based reasoning.

Method: Tina applies parameter-efficient updates using LoRA during reinforcement learning to a small 1.5B parameter base model, achieving performance improvements while minimizing additional computational costs.

Result: The best Tina model achieved a >20% reasoning improvement and 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on the AIME24 dataset while reducing post-training cost by an estimated 260x to just $9 USD.

Conclusion: Efficient reinforcement learning reasoning via LoRA is surprisingly effective, enabling competitive reasoning performance at minimal cost. Open-source resources are also provided to support accessibility and further research.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

*Sangmin Song,Juhwan Choi,JungMin Yun,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) handle multi-user dialogue state tracking (DST), extending a dataset using speech act theory and finding a significant drop in LLM performance compared to single-user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Dialogue State Tracking (DST) benchmarks are focused on single-user interactions, overlooking complex multi-user real-world dynamics. There’s a gap in understanding how LLMs handle this complexity without task-specific training.

Method: Using speech act theory, the researchers augmented an existing DST dataset by adding a second user's utterances. This systematic approach enabled controlled testing of LLM performance in multi-user DST settings.

Result: Experiments revealed a substantial performance drop in multi-user DST for LLMs compared to single-user DST, showcasing the models' struggle in effectively extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling multi-user DST and underscores the importance of future research to adapt and enhance LLM capabilities for realistic, multi-speaker scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

### [62] [Resa: Transparent Reasoning Models via SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09967)
*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Resa, a reasoning model trained using an efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) method, achieving high performance at drastically reduced costs and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to make reasoning capabilities in language models cost-effective and efficient by leveraging their underlying representations without relying on detailed reasoning traces.

Method: The authors propose SAE-Tuning, which uses sparse autoencoders to capture and guide reasoning abilities in language models through supervised fine-tuning, based purely on question-answer data.

Result: SAE-Tuning retains over 97% of RL-trained models’ reasoning abilities while reducing costs by >2000x and training time by >450x; it also achieves high reasoning performance on benchmarks like AIME24 and AMC23.

Conclusion: The findings suggest SAE-Tuning enables cost-effective reasoning extraction that is both generalizable and modular, and it significantly reduces resource requirements for training while delivering strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Bo Li,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RRP framework to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) and refining reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to limited background knowledge and hallucination. This paper aims to address these issues by leveraging KGs for enhanced reasoning.

Method: The RRP framework combines semantic capabilities of LLMs with relation embeddings and bidirectional distribution learning for mining KGs. It also incorporates a rethinking module to refine reasoning paths.

Result: RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, demonstrating enhanced reasoning in LLMs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The RRP framework effectively strengthens LLM reasoning capabilities, offering high-quality reasoning paths and easy integration into various LLMs as a plug-and-play enhancement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised hybrid method combining data-driven and rule-based techniques to reconstruct ancestral word forms, achieving better results than baselines in reconstructing Latin protoforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to protoform reconstruction relied heavily on probabilistic models of phonological edits, which are limited by their purely data-driven design. The paper aims to address this gap by integrating linguistic rules with data-driven patterns.

Method: The model combines statistical inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework. This hybrid method uses linguistic and phonological constraints to guide protoform reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms established baselines in reconstructing Latin protoforms, achieving higher accuracy and better phonological plausibility metrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully improves protoform reconstruction by blending statistical and linguistically motivated strategies, showcasing its potential for linguistic and historical language studies.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Motivation: To improve the ability of AI-powered tutors in accurately identifying mistakes in students' mathematical reasoning.

Method: Explores four approaches including pooled embedding ensembles, sentence-transformer with MLP, history-aware attention models, and retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting with GPT-4.

Result: The final system, combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning, outperforms all baseline methods evaluated.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval-augmented prompting with structured output parsing provides a highly effective approach for assessing AI tutor feedback.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models handle character-level tasks like spelling. It identifies that LLMs rely on Transformer layers rather than their embedding layer for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how LLMs internally process and represent character-level information, particularly in tasks like spelling out and identifying compositional subcomponents in tokens.

Method: Three analyses were employed: probing classifiers, identifying specific neurons responsible for character-level knowledge, and inspecting attention weights during LLM processing.

Result: Findings indicate that LLMs' embedding layers do not fully encode character-level details, requiring intermediate and higher Transformer layers for this task. A distinct breakthrough in behavior specifically for spelling was observed.

Conclusion: LLMs do not process spelling-out tasks in a straightforward manner and depend on higher layers to reconstruct character-level information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the strong potential of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) like Mistral and Llama-2 for detecting life-threatening texts, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve mental health and safety by identifying life-threatening language, addressing gaps in effective real-world detection methods.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned open-source LLMs Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 (7B parameters each) using balanced, imbalanced, and extremely imbalanced datasets, and compared their performance to traditional approaches.

Result: LLMs, especially Mistral and Llama-2, exhibited superior performance in detecting life-threatening language across all data scenarios, while traditional methods benefited from upsampling but lagged behind.

Conclusion: LLMs are highly effective in detecting life-threatening language, showing robustness even in imbalanced datasets, thereby holding considerable promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many links in the Open English Wordnet are missing, especially regarding adjectival hypernymy, which hinders its effectiveness as a linguistic resource.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical discussion on hypernymy differences for adjectives, create a new resource for adjective hypernymy, and adapt/fine-tune large language models like TaxoLLaMa for prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREMISE, a prompt-only method to reduce token usage in large reasoning models (LRMs) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large reasoning models consume excessive tokens during lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning, leading to higher costs and latency, limiting their deployment in constrained environments.

Method: PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization, employing multi-objective textual search to balance token length and accuracy in a single-pass black-box interface without modifying model weights.

Result: In benchmarks like GSM8K and Math500, PREMISE matches or improves baseline accuracy while cutting tokens by up to 87.5% and costs by 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization via PREMISE enables efficient, accurate, and scalable reasoning for LRMs without altering the underlying model weights.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClaimSpect, a framework that deconstructs claims into hierarchical aspects, retrieves corpus-specific perspectives, and assesses varying stances towards sub-aspects of those claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Claims, especially in scientific and political contexts, are often too nuanced for binary true/false evaluations. This necessitates a structured, aspect-based analysis to understand claims comprehensively and cater to specific priorities.

Method: The authors propose ClaimSpect, a framework using retrieval-augmented generation to partition an input corpus into a hierarchy of aspects, retrieve relevant segments, and discover varying perspectives toward claims.

Result: ClaimSpect was tested on a dataset containing real-world scientific and political claims. It demonstrated robustness and accuracy in deconstructing nuanced claims and showcasing varying perspectives.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect effectively decomposes nuanced claims into structured perspectives and sub-aspects, proving valuable in analyzing complex claims within the scientific and political domains.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Nan Zhang,Yunyi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Prasenjit Mitra,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a method for dynamically adapting a language model-generated taxonomy to evolving scientific domains, outperforming previous approaches in granularity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing and retrieving scientific literature is challenging due to the rapid evolution of scientific fields and limitations in current taxonomy methods.

Method: TaxoAdapt dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy by iterative hierarchical classification, enhancing both taxonomy breadth and depth.

Result: TaxoAdapt improves taxonomy coherence by 50.41% and granularity preservation by 26.51% compared to competitive baselines.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt successfully structures scientific literature while capturing domain evolution, offering a robust taxonomy solution for dynamic fields.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: Pretraining multilingual LLMs faces challenges such as limited model capacity, insufficient high-quality data, and lack of language coverage in tokenizers, particularly for new languages during post-training adaptation.

Method: The authors propose designing a universal tokenizer trained for a broader set of languages compared to the primary pretraining languages, conducting experiments across diverse language groups and training strategies to evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: The approach demonstrates significantly improved language adaptation capabilities, with up to 20.2% better win rates for covered languages and up to 5% improvement for completely unseen languages, while maintaining performance on pretraining languages.

Conclusion: Using a universal tokenizer during pretraining enhances model plasticity for new languages without major compromises in core language performance, offering a scalable solution for expanding language support.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates uncertainty estimation methods in clinical multiple-choice question answering using ten open-source LLMs and introduces lightweight single-pass estimators for effective uncertainty measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimates are critical for using large language models in sensitive domains like clinical decision support.

Method: Fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty methods, testing ten open-source LLMs across datasets, specialties, and question types, while introducing single-pass estimators using behavioral signals.

Result: Significant variation was found across medical specialties and question types; lightweight estimators perform comparably to advanced methods like Semantic Entropy.

Conclusion: Model selection needs careful consideration based on question nature and the particular strengths of the language models.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

*Viet Anh Trinh,Xinlu He,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a mechanism that uses large language models (LLMs) to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems' handling of named entities, achieving significant error rate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical for downstream applications, yet ASR systems struggle with accurately recognizing them, impacting overall system performance.

Method: The authors introduce a revision mechanism leveraging LLMs and local contextual information (e.g., lecture notes) to correct named entity errors in ASR outputs. Additionally, they develop a dataset (NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare) for evaluation.

Result: The proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for named entities on a specialized dataset.

Conclusion: The LLM-based revision approach enhances ASR system accuracy for named entities, improving performance on critical tasks without requiring extensive changes to the primary ASR framework.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit is a framework addressing multilingual knowledge update challenges in large language models (LLMs). It ensures updates don’t interfere across languages by mathematically isolating changes to specific subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs is difficult due to destructive parameter interference and costs associated with managing separate models for each language.

Method: LangEdit introduces a null-space constrained framework that isolates language-specific updates by projecting them orthogonally to previously updated subspaces.

Result: Experiments on three architectures, six languages, and four tasks reveal LangEdit mitigates interference and surpasses state-of-the-art editing methods.

Conclusion: LangEdit provides an innovative, efficient, and accurate approach to multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs while preserving generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReCUT proposes a novel method to reduce reasoning length in Chain-of-Thought prompting for Large Language Models while preserving or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in Chain-of-Thought prompting often lead to overly lengthy reasoning, limiting efficiency. The study aims to balance reasoning length and accuracy effectively.

Method: The authors introduced ReCUT, combining stepwise exploration and a long-short switched sampling strategy to generate diverse reasoning paths, at the same time training two models for accuracy and brevity, and interpolating their parameters.

Result: ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by 30-50% while maintaining or improving accuracy across various math reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: By achieving shorter and more accurate reasoning with LLMs, ReCUT offers a practical improvement to Chain-of-Thought methods, advancing the efficiency in reasoning tasks for large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed SlowFast Sampling offers faster and flexible decoding for diffusion-based language models, achieving significant speedups while retaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for diffusion-based language models are static, leading to efficiency and flexibility issues.

Method: Introduced SlowFast Sampling, a dynamic strategy alternating between exploratory and accelerated decoding guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles. Integrated with a caching mechanism to reduce redundant computations.

Result: Achieved up to 15.63× speedup with minimal accuracy loss and up to 34.22× speedup with caching, outperforming autoregressive baselines in throughput.

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling significantly enhances the efficiency and quality of diffusion-based language models, unlocking their potential as a viable alternative to autoregressive models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how wav2vec2 speech models trained on different languages represent phonetic, tonal, and speaker information, finding representation structures to be language-independent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether wav2vec2 self-supervised models encode information in ways specific to the language they were trained on or if these representations are universal across languages.

Method: Utilized probing classifiers and geometric analyses to study how phones, tones, and speaker information are represented in models pre-trained on various languages.

Result: Found that the encoded subspaces for phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal across languages, with matched-language phone and tone probes performing slightly better in later layers, but speaker information remains consistent.

Conclusion: The structure of representations in wav2vec2 models shows language-independent characteristics, indicating universality in the learned features regardless of training language.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems often fail to identify relevant medical knowledge and generate medically accurate, personalized responses, prompting the need for a more effective system.

Method: The paper introduces MedRef, a system utilizing a knowledge refining mechanism to filter irrelevant data and dynamic prompt structuring for comprehensive patient interaction. Two modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, provide adaptability to diverse patient conditions.

Result: MedRef outperformed state-of-the-art systems in generation quality and medical entity accuracy on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef offers a reliable and effective solution for real-world healthcare applications by addressing critical shortcomings in medical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fine-tuning affects large language models’ performance, and to verify efficiency of parameter-efficient methods.

Method: Analyze performance across HellaSwag, GSM8K, and MMLU-CS tasks using LoRA and QLoRA methods, focusing on task alignment and computational efficiency.

Result: LoRA-based methods improve task-specific performance efficiently; performance relies on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA is effective for efficient LLM adaptation, especially with careful dataset-task alignment, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve

*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit both generalization and hallucination due to out-of-context reasoning (OCR), which associates concepts regardless of causal links. Matrix factorization and gradient descent bias drive this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dual behaviors of language models—generalization and hallucination—and identifying the underlying mechanism to improve knowledge injection handling.

Method: Authors formalize OCR via a synthetic factual recall task and use experiments with simplified transformer models to isolate key mechanisms, leveraging theoretical analysis regarding gradient descent biases and matrix factorization.

Result: Experiments confirm OCR drives both desirable generalization and hallucination. A one-layer model with factorized matrices learns OCR efficiently, while combined-weight models perform poorly, highlighting the role of factorization.

Conclusion: This study establishes a theoretical framework for OCR, pinpointing matrix factorization and gradient descent bias as keys to understanding generalization and hallucination in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base

### [85] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic method using LLM-based ensemble judges for evaluating autoformalization in formal math, focusing on nuanced criteria like logical preservation, mathematical consistency, and formal quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of evaluating autoformalization in advanced mathematics through human assessment requires significant expertise and time. Current methods with generic rules are insufficient, motivating the need for a refined, scalable, and automated evaluation system.

Method: The authors propose an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges based on criteria, such as logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality, offering a multi-dimensional and transparent assessment mechanism.

Result: The experiments show that the EFG ensemble better correlates with human assessments compared to generic coarse-grained models, particularly for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning's nuanced aspects.

Conclusion: The EFG approach demonstrates promise as a scalable and interpretable framework for evaluating autoformalization, paving the way for leveraging LLMs effectively in formal mathematics assessment tasks.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Motivation: To explore the capabilities of pure RL training of LLMs using a ground-up approach, avoiding reliance on existing implementations or pre-collected RL traces.

Method: The researchers built a standalone RL training stack, implemented a simple method for enforcing reasoning language, and used RL on text data alone to train LLMs.

Conclusion: Magistral Medium is trained effectively with pure RL; Magistral Small, including data from Magistral Medium, is open-sourced under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable

up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving mechanistic interpretability in large language models (LLMs) by using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to identify interpretable activation features, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing methods like sparse autoencoders, which struggle with causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability when analyzing features in LLM activation space.

Method: The authors propose a novel method involving direct decomposition of MLP activations using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), ensuring interpretable features aligned with activating inputs and sparse representations.

Result: Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and GPT-2 demonstrate that SNMF-derived features are superior to SAEs and a difference-in-means supervised baseline in causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts.

Conclusion: SNMF is positioned as an effective and simpler alternative for discovering interpretable features and revealing concept hierarchies in activation spaces of LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying

### [88] [Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934)
*Timothy Obiso,Kenneth Lai,Abhijnan Nath,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,James Pustejovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores epistemic friction, which occurs when there's resistance in updating beliefs based on new conflicting information. Using Dynamic Epistemic Logic, it models and predicts belief updates in collaborative dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how dynamic epistemic friction affects belief updates in dialogues, which has been overlooked in aligning LLMs for human-AI collaboration.

Method: The authors incorporate Dynamic Epistemic Logic to define epistemic friction, analyze belief revision in collaborative tasks, and propose a model to measure belief alignment.

Result: Analyses in collaborative scenarios confirm that the epistemic friction model predicts belief updates effectively in real-world dialogue.

Conclusion: Epistemic friction can be systematically modeled to improve belief alignment in human-like dialogue for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

### [89] [Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10952)
*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec introduces meta-domains to analyze datasets, enabling efficient selection of data mixtures for language model pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance computational efficiency in identifying optimal data mixtures for language model training.

Method: Domain2Vec uses meta-domains as a vocabulary and decomposes datasets into domain vectors for distribution alignment.

Result: Domain2Vec achieves reduced computational overhead while improving downstream performance and validation loss alignment.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec demonstrates scalability, efficiency, and improved performance, proving valuable for language model pretraining strategies.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Chinese content harm detection benchmark, including datasets and methods, leveraging annotated expert knowledge and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the scarcity of Chinese datasets for harmful content detection and enhance content moderation with accurate, representative data.

Method: The authors build a professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection, covering six content categories. They also develop a knowledge-augmented baseline combining explicit expert knowledge with LLM insights.

Result: The proposed method enabled smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art language models in harmful content detection.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable resources and methodologies to advance Chinese content harm detection, filling a significant gap in non-English harm detection datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

*Yixin Ou,Yujie Luo,Jingsheng Zheng,Lanning Wei,Shuofei Qiao,Jintian Zhang,Da Zheng,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind addresses limitations of LLMs in automated data science with expert knowledge, intelligent solution exploration, and dynamic coding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have promise but struggle with complex tasks due to rigid workflows and lack of empirical expertise.

Method: AutoMind integrates a knowledge base, a knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: AutoMind outperforms current methods on benchmarks in performance, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind is a significant advancement in fully automating data science workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates reasoning models' ability to self-reevaluate when exposed to unhelpful thoughts and identifies performance gaps, especially with larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how reasoning models detect and recover from unhelpful thoughts, which is crucial for developing more accurate and safer AI reasoning systems.

Method: The authors inject four types of unhelpful thoughts into reasoning models' thinking processes to examine their identification and recovery abilities. They also explore scaling trends with model sizes.

Result: Models can identify unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, leading to performance drops. Larger models are observed to perform worse than smaller ones in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: Current reasoning models lack robust self-reevaluation capabilities, highlighting the need for improvements to achieve stronger meta-cognitive reasoning and safer AI systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method to enable flexible and efficient video editing with pre-trained Image-to-Video models, addressing the limitations of large-scale pretraining and restricted control over edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods using diffusion models require large-scale pretraining and lack flexibility in editing subsequent frames after the first frame.

Method: The proposed method uses a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy with spatial masks to adapt pre-trained image-to-video models. It incorporates additional visual references and allows for region-specific learning while maintaining background preservation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art video editing techniques in terms of performance and control.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, flexible, and adaptable solution for video editing without changing the underlying model architecture.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DeepTraverse, a vision architecture inspired by search algorithms, focusing on systematic features and adaptive refinement to outperform conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional vision backbones that lack adaptive and structured refinement, and to explore if algorithmic search principles can enhance interpretability and reasoning within vision models.

Method: The proposed method, DeepTraverse, utilizes recursive exploration modules for deeper feature analysis with parameter sharing, and adaptive calibration modules to adjust feature salience dynamically based on context.

Result: DeepTraverse delivers competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination across various benchmarks, outperforming or matching conventional models with comparable or larger parameter sizes.

Conclusion: Incorporating algorithmic search principles into vision architectures provides an effective approach to building more efficient, structured, and powerful vision backbones.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a training-free framework designed to accelerate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model inference by addressing computational and memory redundancies holistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models face deployment challenges due to high computational demands and inefficiencies stemming from inherent redundancies.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: layer pruning in the language module, optimized visual token selection for task-awareness, and caching/reusing intermediate features in the diffusion-based action head.

Result: When applied to CogACT, EfficientVLA achieves a 1.93x inference speedup, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, and maintains a 0.6% success rate drop on the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA addresses varied inefficiencies in VLA pipelines, making them more practical for real-world deployment without significantly compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset called ICCWD to benchmark methods for detecting minors in digital content and evaluates three detectors, with the best achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on machine learning to detect content depicting minors, yet no benchmark dataset exists for this purpose, particularly in multi-modal environments.

Method: The authors developed the ICCWD, a dataset of 10,000 manually labeled image-caption pairs showcasing children in diverse contexts, to evaluate and benchmark detection methods.

Result: They tested three detection methods, including a commercial age estimation system, achieving a highest true positive rate of 75.3%, demonstrating the difficulty of the task.

Conclusion: The release of ICCWD is expected to drive improvements in minor detection systems and performance across varied applications.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Method: Pre-trained CNNs and ViTs models were adapted to a specific medical image dataset and evaluated based on performance metrics like f1-score.

Result: While both CNNs and ViTs showed high predictive power, ViTs excelled with smaller models. DaViT-B achieved an f1-score of 96.4%, emerging as the best performer.

TL;DR: The authors have developed a reinforcement learning proxy task called ViCrit to improve vision-language models' perceptual capability by training them to identify subtle synthetic visual errors in captions, leading to performance gains across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the current difficulty in extending reinforcement learning fine-tuning success to vision-language models due to the lack of vision-specific tasks that are both challenging and unambiguously verifiable.

Method: The authors propose the ViCrit task, which involves injecting synthetically subtle errors into human-written image captions and training the model to precisely identify these errors with the help of a binary, exact-match reward metric.

Result: Models fine-tuned with the ViCrit task show significant improvements in various vision-language benchmarks and outperform in areas like abstract image reasoning and visual math, showcasing generalized learning capacity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fine-grained hallucination criticism through the ViCrit task is an effective and generalizable approach for enhancing visual perception in vision-language models, supported by the introduction of the diagnostic ViCrit-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoCA, a Gaussian process-based framework to improve cross-domain robustness in E2E autonomous driving, addressing challenges in domain adaptation for deployment across cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2E autonomous driving faces practical challenges in cross-domain deployment due to varied urban environments, and existing approaches including LLMs struggle in achieving consistent cross-domain driving performance.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution using Gaussian processes over tokens representing ego and surrounding vehicle information. It learns basis tokens and their trajectories to model diverse driving scenarios and infer future trajectories probabilistically.

Result: The framework successfully improves domain generalization and adaptation performance while reducing retraining costs. Evaluations across varied domain scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RoCA enhances generalizability in E2E autonomous driving and facilitates robust adaptation to new domains without adding inference computation, offering a solution for deploying autonomous driving systems in diverse environments.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARKE, a scalable method to enhance diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models by using conditional entropy for prompt-aware diversity, reducing computational complexity for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models, especially for broad semantic prompts that require prompt-aware diversity evaluation.

Method: SPARKE employs conditional entropy as a diversity measure and adjusts it dynamically based on similar prompts. It optimizes computational efficiency, reducing the complexity from O(n^3) to O(n) for large-scale generation settings.

Result: Experimental results show that SPARKE improves the prompt-aware diversity of data generated by text-to-image diffusion models, achieving this without incurring significant computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed SPARKE method successfully enhances prompt-aware diversity in generative models, making it computationally feasible for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on

### [103] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based emulator for satellite-based solar radiation retrieval, improving accuracy by internally inferring clear-sky surface reflectance without relying on hand-crafted features like albedo maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for retrieving surface solar radiation from satellite imagery struggle in complex terrains, particularly mountainous areas with dynamic conditions like intermittent snow cover.

Method: The authors designed a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer-based model that uses raw satellite image sequences, topographic features, and solar geometry to infer surface reflectance. Training was conducted using data from Switzerland provided by the HelioMont algorithm.

Result: The model achieved comparable performance to albedo-informed models and demonstrated improved generalization in complex terrains, effectively leveraging latent surface reflectance dynamics.

Conclusion: The study highlights that attention-based approaches can enhance solar radiation retrieval by learning background reflectance patterns, especially in challenging mountainous regions.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

*Bill Psomas,Dionysis Christopoulos,Eirini Baltzi,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou,Tilemachos Aravanis,Nikos Komodakis,Konstantinos Karantzalos,Yannis Avrithis,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Linear probing inadequately reflects the potential of Masked Image Modeling (MIM); efficient probing (EP) is introduced as a better alternative with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing struggles with distributed patch-level representations in MIM, creating a need for an efficient and effective alternative.

Method: The paper introduces efficient probing (EP), utilizing a multi-query cross-attention mechanism to reduce redundant projections, minimize trainable parameters, and improve efficiency.

Result: EP achieves up to a 10x speedup, surpasses both linear probing and prior attentive probing approaches across benchmarks, generalizes to other SSL paradigms, and excels in low-shot and layer-wise scenarios.

Conclusion: Efficient probing proves to be a superior and interpretable evaluation protocol for MIM and other SSL methods, balancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off effectively.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to adapt vision-language models for personalized retrieval, achieving significant improvements in accuracy for natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of recognizing personalized concepts (e.g., "my dog Fido") using limited images, while ensuring general knowledge integration for versatile retrieval.

Method: The approach involves regularized low-rank adaptation of parameters in the language encoder's final layer and parameter addition for combining multiple personal concepts.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks, with improvements of 4%-22% over previous approaches.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that adapting representation in vision-language models allows for effective personalized retrieval while maintaining general knowledge.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScoreMix, a data augmentation method that uses diffusion models to improve discriminator performance, especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional data augmentation methods face limitations in scenarios with scarce labeled data, requiring novel approaches to enhance discriminative capabilities.

Method: ScoreMix leverages score compositional properties of diffusion models, mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories to produce synthetic training samples.

Result: ScoreMix improves discriminative performance across benchmarks, especially when mixing classes distant in the discriminator’s embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix effectively enhances training discriminative models without requiring extensive parameter tuning, making it a practical solution against large dataset collection challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark dataset and a multi-modal deep learning model for predicting crop yields in California using diverse data sources, achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite abundant historical crop yield data, accurately forecasting yields is challenging due to complex environmental, climatic, and soil interactions.

Method: The study develops a multi-modal deep learning model using data from satellite imagery, climate records, soil properties, and more, employing stratified feature extraction and temporal encoding.

Result: The model achieves an R2 score of 0.76 in predicting county-level, crop-specific yields across diverse agricultural regions in California.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and model provide a strong foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming, with all resources publicly accessible.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DySS, a model optimizing camera-based 3D object detection by utilizing state-space learning and dynamic queries for high performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object detection methods in BEV are either computationally expensive due to dense features or require numerous queries, especially with extended video frames, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: DySS employs a state-space model (SSM) with sequential processing, enhanced via future prediction and masked reconstruction tasks. It dynamically adjusts queries (merge, remove, split) to maintain efficiency and performance.

Result: The DySS model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes dataset, achieving 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on the test split, and 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP on the validation split with a real-time speed of 33 FPS.

Conclusion: DySS offers an innovative approach combining state-space learning and dynamic queries, proving effective for efficient and precise 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalLoc, a dataset created for efficient hallucination detection in large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting hallucinations in vision-language models efficiently and probabilistically.

Method: Developed a 150K token-level annotated dataset called HalLoc for hallucination detection, alongside a baseline model for concurrent detection.

Result: HalLoc allows detection of hallucinations with graded confidence and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models.

Conclusion: HalLoc improves the reliability of vision-language models, providing a low-overhead solution for enhancing trustworthiness in applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer diagnosis using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques on the HAM10000 dataset, highlighting the effectiveness of CLIP-based models and UQ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin cancer diagnosis is crucial for better patient outcomes, and deep learning models face challenges like data scarcity and uncertainty in predictions.

Method: The study applied transfer learning with various feature extractors (CLIP, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, EfficientNet-V2-Large) combined with classifiers (SVM, XGBoost, logistic regression). Uncertainty quantification was incorporated using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD).

Result: CLIP-based models with SVM achieved the highest classification performance. Ensemble approaches provided a good balance between accuracy and uncertainty, while EMCD was highly sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty quantification into deep learning not only enhances prediction accuracy but also improves reliability and trustworthiness in clinical applications for skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal framework to automatically generate structured SOAP notes for skin carcinoma documentation using lesion images and limited clinical text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physician-generated SOAP notes are labor-intensive and contribute to clinician burnout, necessitating scalable automation solutions.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal approach leveraging lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing dependence on manual annotation and enabling scalable documentation.

Result: Achieved comparable performance to leading AI models (GPT-4o, Claude, etc.) using new metrics such as MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates scalable documentation while reducing clinician burden and reliance on large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Motivation: The growing significance of the Metaverse and the shift from professional to user-generated omnidirectional video content necessitate improved methods for evaluating their audio-visual quality.

Method: A new dataset with 300 UGC-ODV videos shot using two types of cameras by five individuals is created. The dataset is evaluated using subjective Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs), and a baseline AVQA model integrating video, audio, and fusion features is proposed.

Result: The AVQA baseline model achieved optimal performance on the newly constructed UGC-ODV dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study provides a meaningful AVQA dataset and advances research in UGC-ODV quality assessment by presenting a strong model baseline.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models were tested for analyzing students' academic emotions through facial expressions in an online learning setting, achieving moderate results, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct showing better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches for analyzing academic emotions require repetitive data cycles and fail to generalize effectively. Vision-Language Models offer potential for zero-shot generalization without additional fine-tuning.

Method: Two Vision-Language Models, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, were tested using zero-shot prompting on 5,000 images showcasing various academic emotions (confused, distracted, happy, neutral, tired).

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperformed Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct in overall detection. Both models excelled in identifying 'happy' expressions but struggled with 'distracted' behavior. Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct also performed well in recognizing 'confused' expressions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the moderate capabilities of Vision-Language Models for academic emotion analysis, particularly highlighting Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct's potential to detect confusion, which can aid in content improvement for online learning environments.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework enhancing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for rendering scenes with sparse views, addressing overfitting issues and improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting methods overfit and degrade rendering quality with sparse training views, creating a need for more robust rendering strategies.

Method: The framework uses a stereo foundation model for camera pose estimation, point cloud reconstruction, feature encoding from sparse views, and a self-attention-based point interaction network for feature enhancement.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method performs significantly better than NeRF-based methods and rivals state-of-the-art 3DGS systems in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The study presents a reliable approach for real-time, high-quality rendering from limited input views, advancing 3DGS applicability in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is proposed to improve local geometry-controllable CAD generation and resolve limitations of existing methods, utilizing geometric instructions and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the automation and efficiency of modifying local CAD model parts while ensuring adherence to specific geometric instructions, which existing methods struggle to do.

Method: GeoCAD employs a complementary captioning strategy for generating geometric instructions through vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning. It trains large language models by random masking of local parts in CAD models and prompts them to predict the masked parts based on geometric instructions.

Result: GeoCAD achieves superior generation quality, validity, and consistency between text instructions and CAD outputs, as demonstrated in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GeoCAD provides a user-friendly and effective solution for locally controllable CAD modifications, addressing challenges in text-to-CAD instruction following and local generation.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a vision-language model framework for analyzing urban streetscapes, applied on a dataset featuring Beijing and Shenzhen, achieving high evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for studying urban cultural differences heavily rely on subjective expert analyses and historical documentation, lacking scalability and objectivity.

Method: The authors constructed UrbanDiffBench, a dataset featuring architectural images, and developed UrbanSense, a vision-language model framework to analyze and compare urban streetscape styles quantitatively.

Result: The framework achieved over 80% accuracy in generating descriptions that passed t-tests (p<0.05) and demonstrated high Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) in subjective assessments.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the utility of using vision-language models for objectivity and scalability in urban cultural research and emphasizes their potential for quantifying urban style evolution and aiding future urban design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic, machine learning-based method for medical image registration without resampling artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for medical image registration methods that avoid the artifacts introduced by resampling images into fixed resolutions, which currently limits previous machine learning-based approaches.

Method: The authors extend KeyMorph, a registration framework, to output keypoints in real-world scanner coordinates using the affine matrix produced by imaging devices, thereby training the model to process raw data without resampling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate RKM's effectiveness in registering orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs and 3D brain volumes with varying resolutions.

Conclusion: RKM offers an innovative resolution-agnostic image registration method that eliminates the need for resampling, showing promising results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Motion-R1, a chain-of-thought framework for better text-to-motion generation, emphasizing reasoning and structured semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion models struggle with controllability, consistency, and diversity, especially in interpreting complex, multi-step commands.

Method: Motion-R1 uses a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to decompose textual instructions into logical action paths, coupled with Group Relative Policy Optimization for joint optimization of reasoning and synthesis.

Result: Motion-R1 demonstrates superior performance in cases requiring complex semantic understanding and long-term coherence across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Motion-R1 enhances text-to-motion generation by integrating logical reasoning paths and reinforcement learning for improved interpretability and execution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSATFusion, a new end-to-end Transformer-based fusion network for infrared and visible image fusion, demonstrating superior performance and generalization abilities in comparison with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of convolutional operations in global context capturing for infrared and visible image fusion, which leads to information loss and restricts performance.

Method: The FSATFusion network incorporates a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module that uses a frequency-spatial attention mechanism and an improved Transformer module to extract global and discriminative features efficiently.

Result: FSATFusion outperformed state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in fusion quality and efficiency. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent generalization in unrelated tasks and superiority in object detection.

Conclusion: FSATFusion is an effective and generalizable approach for image fusion and other visual tasks, offering enhanced fusion performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unifying image processing framework to better interpret and explain self-attention mechanics, including positional encoding and residual connections, while also proposing improvements boosting accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in Transformer architectures, while highly successful, is heuristically driven and difficult to interpret, motivating the need for a theoretical framework to better explain its functioning and limitations.

Method: The authors introduce a unifying framework based on image processing principles to interpret self-attention and its components, and propose two architectural modifications inspired by this understanding.

Result: The proposed modifications not only improve interpretability but also enhance accuracy, robustness to data contamination and adversarial attacks, and the ability to handle long sequences.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theoretical understanding of self-attention and its components, providing interpretability while empirically demonstrating performance gains through image processing-inspired improvements.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PoseIDON, a computer vision system combining deep learning and photogrammetry to estimate object burial depth on the seafloor for ecological risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and mitigation of risks related to anthropogenic objects buried on the seafloor, which also helps to assess pollutant transport and environmental hazards.

Method: Using multiview photogrammetry and CAD model alignment integrated with deep foundation model features for estimating the burial depth and pose of objects recorded in ROV video.

Result: Validated on 54 objects including barrels and munitions, PoseIDON achieved a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 cm and revealed sediment transport processes at an ocean dumpsite.

Conclusion: PoseIDON offers a scalable and precise approach for mapping seafloor burial of objects, facilitating environmental assessments and supporting mitigation strategies at contaminated sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DART, a dynamic patch partitioning method for vision models, enhancing accuracy and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore alternatives to fixed-size patches in vision models, which often over-encode backgrounds and miss critical details.

Method: Develops Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART) that adaptively allocates tokens using region scores and quantile operations to focus on information-rich areas.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT with a 45% reduction in FLOPs, outperforming traditional fixed-token methods.

Conclusion: DART offers an efficient, scalable, and high-performing mechanism for adaptive patch partitioning in visual tasks.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReconMOST, a diffusion model framework for reconstructing multi-layer ocean temperatures globally using simulation and sparse observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ocean reconstruction methods face difficulties due to sparse data, algorithm complexity, and high computational costs. ML techniques mainly focus on sea surface temperatures and local areas but struggle with issues like cloud occlusion.

Method: ReconMOST trains an unconditional diffusion model on historical simulation data to capture consistent ocean temperature distributions and uses sparse observational data as guidance for reconstruction.

Result: ReconMOST effectively reconstructs missing ocean temperature data globally, handling over 92.5% missing data, and achieves a mean squared error of 0.680 for reconstruction on test datasets.

Conclusion: ReconMOST establishes a robust framework for precise, global, and multi-layer ocean temperature reconstruction, overcoming traditional method limitations, with demonstrated validity and generalization capability.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: This paper presents Pisces, a unified multimodal model for both image understanding and generation using a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and advanced training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models often struggle to match the performance of specialized models due to differing visual features and training processes required for image understanding and generation.

Method: Pisces employs a decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques, along with careful data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, to address the challenges of unifying these tasks.

Result: Pisces achieves competitive results in over 20 benchmarks for image understanding and robust performance in image generation on the GenEval benchmark.

Conclusion: The study highlights the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and shows the advantages of using separate visual encoders to advance unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRRNet, a novel end-to-end infrared small target detection framework, addressing challenges in complex backgrounds using the CRS paradigm to model low-rank background structures effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection of small infrared targets in complex backgrounds is hindered by low signal-to-clutter ratios, varied target shapes, and lack of clear visual features, necessitating more robust methodologies.

Method: The proposed method, LRRNet, uses a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to directly model low-rank background representations through deep neural networks without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple datasets show that LRRNet surpasses 38 state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency; it achieves a speed of 82.34 FPS and is effective in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: LRRNet demonstrates its capability as a powerful, real-time, and noise-resilient solution for infrared small target detection in complex scenes, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MF2Summ, a multimodal video summarization model integrating visual and auditory data, achieving improved performance on SumMe and TVSum datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inadequacy of traditional video summarization techniques that rely solely on visual data to capture the semantic richness of modern video content.

Method: The proposed MF2Summ model uses five stages—feature extraction, cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection—leveraging a cross-modal Transformer and alignment-guided self-attention Transformer for inter-modal and temporal modeling.

Result: MF2Summ outperforms the DSNet model, improving F1-scores by 1.9% on the SumMe dataset and 0.6% on the TVSum dataset, and also shows competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: MF2Summ demonstrates the advantages of a multimodal approach by effectively integrating visual and auditory information to achieve better performance in video summarization tasks.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIDer, a framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) to handle missing modalities and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data with fewer parameters and faster training compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenges of modality missing and OOD data in multimodal emotion recognition, while overcoming limitations of large parameter models used in existing methods.

Method: CIDer framework includes Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) for feature robustness under random modality feature missing and Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) to handle OOD issues with causal graphs and counterfactual texts.

Result: CIDer achieves robust performance in handling both RMFM and OOD challenges, with fewer parameters and faster training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a practical and efficient solution for MER, tackling key challenges with novel tasks, efficient modules, and robust performance, and making its implementation publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using an Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) approach for better Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC) performance, solving issues with explicit motion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human body video compression presents greater challenges compared to facial videos due to complex and diverse motion patterns, leading to distortions and inaccuracies in existing motion-based methods.

Method: The authors propose an IMT paradigm, where complex human body signals are encoded into compact visual features and then transformed into implicit motion guidance for reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the IMT approach, enabling high-efficiency compression accompanied by high-quality synthesis.

Conclusion: The IMT paradigm addresses the limitations of explicit motion-based GHVC methods, offering improved compression performance and fidelity for compressing human body videos.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

### [130] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Intermediate Feature Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10459)
*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models using input diversity and feature-focused loss, while addressing unique HSI challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and current methods for hyperspectral images—characterized by high dimensionality—are limited in utilizing image structural and feature information.

Method: The method uses random spatial and spectral block partitioning of HSIs with various transformations to diversify inputs and prevent overfitting. It also introduces a feature distancing loss at intermediate layers to disrupt true-class features and enhance transferability.

Result: Experiments show that adversarial examples generated using the method effectively transfer to black-box models on two public HSI datasets and sustain robust attacks even with defense strategies in place.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective in generating transferable adversarial examples for HSI DNN classifiers, addressing unique challenges and improving robustness against defenses.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

### [131] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of different weight initialization methods on the quantization robustness of deep neural networks and proposes a novel approach called GHN-QAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how weight initialization affects DNN quantization robustness and to develop techniques that improve the initialization process for efficient CNNs.

Method: The study investigates various CNN weight initializations and introduces a method called GHN-QAT, which uses Graph Hypernetworks to predict quantization-robust parameters for DNNs.

Result: GHN-QAT showed improved quantized accuracy for CNNs, including for low-bit settings like 4-bit and 2-bit quantizations, outperforming traditional random initializations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of weight initialization in quantization robustness and introduces GHN-QAT as a promising strategy for improving quantized DNN performance, paving the way for further research in this area.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Piao Yang,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedSeg-R, a model that combines reasoning from large language models and image segmentation to create precise masks based on complex clinical queries. It also presents a new dataset, MedSeg-QA, to aid this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models lack the capability to interpret complex clinical questions and rely heavily on explicit human instructions, hampering their effectiveness in automatic diagnosis.

Method: The framework, MedSeg-R, integrates a global context module to comprehend images and instructions into multi-modal tokens, and a pixel-level grounding module to decode these tokens into precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Additionally, it introduces the MedSeg-QA dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: MedSeg-R achieves superior segmentation accuracy and interpretable medical image analysis across benchmarks due to its combined reasoning and segmentation approach.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced reasoning from MLLMs with segmentation capabilities allows for precise medical image analysis, providing promising advancements for automated clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

*Shahroz Tariq,David Nguyen,M. A. P. Chamikara,Tingmin Wu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot deepfake detection across faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic generation types. While VLMs show interpretative strengths, they are unsuitable as standalone detection systems due to critical failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robustly detecting deepfakes using emerging VLM capabilities while exploring their limitations and potential to advance forensic workflows.

Method: A structured zero-shot evaluation of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok using a benchmark of authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources. Models were assessed for accuracy and reasoning in identifying deepfakes.

Result: VLMs successfully detect surface-level anomalies and provide coherent reasoning but exhibit critical vulnerabilities to misleading visual patterns and stylistic biases, limiting their standalone capability for deepfake detection.

Conclusion: While VLMs are currently unreliable as independent detection systems, their interpretative and contextual strengths suggest value in hybrid or human-in-the-loop forensic frameworks.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized tools and metrics for benchmarking and evaluating Optical Music Recognition performance.

Method: Developed the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB) dataset, featuring diverse musical textures encoded in the **kern format, and the OMR-NED metric for detailed OMR error analysis.

Result: Conducted baseline experiments using the new SMB dataset splits to evaluate state-of-the-art OMR methods effectively.

Conclusion: SMB and OMR-NED enhance OMR research by offering standardized datasets and detailed, fine-grained evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel technique combining continual backpropagation (CB) with class-incremental learning (CIL) to improve the differentiation of honey by botanical origin using hyperspectral imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting consumer interests by accurately identifying honey's botanical origin in the global market is important, but impractical to use all honey varieties for model training.

Method: Comparison of multiple CIL algorithms on honey hyperspectral imaging data and proposing a CB technique to address loss-of-plasticity by reinitializing less-used neurons in neural networks.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the CB method improved the performance of most CIL algorithms by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The integration of CB with CIL methods enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of distinguishing honey's botanical origin, providing a better safeguard for consumers.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation involving coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RRSIS methods face challenges like dense annotation requirements and difficulty in interpreting complex scenes, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: PSLG-SAM first uses a visual grounding network for coarse localization and then employs the Segment Anything Model with enhancements like clustering and iterative optimization for precise segmentation.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves performance and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on two tested datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M).

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM effectively reduces the annotation burden and simplifies complex scene segmentation through its innovative two-stage approach, showing strong potential for RRSIS tasks.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies, scalability issues, and inconsistencies in manual aircraft inspection methods, which are crucial for ensuring the safety and prolonged operational life of fighter aircraft.

Method: The authors developed J-DDL, a system combining 2D images and 3D point cloud data collected by laser scanners and cameras. It employs a specialized YOLO-based damage detection network with innovations like lightweight Fasternet blocks, Efficient Multiscale Attention (EMA) modules, and a new loss function called Inner-CIOU. Damage detected in 2D is mapped to 3D for precise localization.

Result: J-DDL demonstrated its capability to improve damage detection accuracy and efficiency. Its evaluation on a newly created public dataset underscores the system's effectiveness in automated aircraft inspection.

Conclusion: J-DDL represents a significant step forward in automating fighter aircraft inspections, with its innovative techniques improving both precision and coverage. It sets a foundation for further research with a publicly available dataset for the aircraft damage domain.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Result: CogReasoner demonstrates effectiveness in handling streaming video reasoning tasks, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The method and tools provided enhance the ability to process streaming video data efficiently, with code availability promised for further adoption.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a new metric adept at detecting demographic biases in facial recognition systems, especially subtle disparities in distribution tails. Extensive experiments validate CEI's superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for assessing demographic bias in facial recognition systems fail to effectively capture nuanced disparities, especially in the tails of score distributions.

Method: The authors propose CEI, a metric that analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions independently, focusing on tail probabilities and overall shapes. An automated enhancement of CEI, called CEI^A, is also presented to simplify application.

Result: Experiments show that CEI is better at identifying subtle biases in high-performance face recognition systems compared to previous metrics.

Conclusion: CEI and its automated variant, CEI^A, offer robust and sensitive tools for fairness assessments in face biometrics and broader applications involving statistical distribution analysis.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

*Lizhen Wang,Zhurong Xia,Tianshu Hu,Pengrui Wang,Pengfei Wang,Zerong Zheng,Ming Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, Diffusion Transformer (DiT), for generating realistic human-product demonstration videos, preserving identities and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks struggle to maintain the fidelity of human identities and product details, as well as to handle the spatial dynamics of human-product interactions.

Method: The proposed method uses paired human-product references, a masked cross-attention mechanism, and structured text encoding for category-level semantics, combined with motion guidance via 3D body meshes and product bounding boxes.

Result: Experiments show the framework exceeds current techniques in maintaining both identity integrity and generating realistic motions, validated via a hybrid dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT framework is effective for creating high-fidelity demonstration videos with enhanced realism and accurate human-product interactions.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and

### [146] [Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573)
*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework PLACE to improve cross-modal learning from medical images and reports by focusing on pathological-level alignment and fine-grained correlation exploration without requiring additional annotations, achieving superior performance in multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in the medical domain and overcome the complexity of aligning lengthy medical reports and images, particularly ensuring pathological-level consistency.

Method: PLACE employs a Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) approach to align pathology observations across images and reports and introduces a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor for representation extraction. A proxy task is also designed to identify correlations among image regions, enriching fine-grained details.

Result: The PLACE framework achieves state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks such as classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively alleviates the challenges in medical image-report joint learning by enhancing pathological-level alignment and enriching fine-grained details, demonstrating robustness and generalizability in the absence of additional annotations.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [147] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DanceChat, a music-to-dance generation framework leveraging a large language model (LLM) for textual motion instruction, improving diversity and alignment of generated dances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music-to-dance generation faces challenges due to the abstract nature of musical cues and the scarcity of paired music-dance data.

Method: DanceChat incorporates (1) pseudo instruction generation via LLM, (2) multi-modal feature fusion of music, rhythm, and text, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module with alignment loss.

Result: The DanceChat framework outperforms state-of-the-art music-to-dance generation models in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: DanceChat demonstrates the advantages of LLM-guided textual instructions for achieving diverse, musically-aligned, and high-quality dance motion synthesis.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Chun-Mei Feng,Kai Yu,Xinxing Xu,Salman Khan,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Wangmeng Zuo,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-PAL leverages text-to-image generation and CLIP models for improved multi-label image recognition without requiring fully annotated training images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the modality gap between image and text features in CLIP-like models, which limits their performance in image recognition tasks like multi-label recognition.

Method: T2I-PAL uses text-to-image generation with pre-trained models, class-wise heatmaps, learnable prototypes, prompt tuning, and adapter learning for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks (MS-COCO, VOC2007, NUS-WIDE) show a 3.47% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL reduces annotation requirements, enhances multi-label recognition, and integrates seamlessly with CLIP while addressing modality gaps.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSphereDiff aligns diffusion models with hyperspherical data geometry to improve generative accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models fail to preserve angular geometry in hyperspherical data, leading to diminished generative performance.

Method: HyperSphereDiff uses directional noise to maintain class geometry and angular uncertainty in hyperspherical spaces.

Result: HyperSphereDiff demonstrates better preservation of hyperspherical structure across multiple datasets, improving generative modeling.

Conclusion: Aligning diffusion processes with intrinsic data geometry enhances generative performance and preserves class-specific patterns.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

### [150] [Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582)
*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper refines the use of random masking in Vision Transformer (ViT) self-distillation by applying it only to specific views, improving model robustness and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in self-distillation frameworks like DINO can accidentally remove critical semantic information, prompting the need for better masking strategies.

Method: Only the student's global view undergoes random masking, while local views and the teacher's global view remain unmasked to balance clean supervision and robustness.

Result: Experiments with DINO-Tiny on mini-ImageNet demonstrate more robust and detailed attention maps, improving downstream performance.

Conclusion: The study shows that a selective random masking strategy can effectively enhance the training process and outcomes in ViT self-distillation frameworks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new hierarchical error assessment framework (HEA-MM) for quality evaluation of aircraft CAD models using structured light scanners and multi-level error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality assurance of aviation equipment by improving error analysis methods for aircraft CAD models in a manufacturing-and-measurement context.

Method: The HEA-MM framework employs structured light scanners for obtaining 3D measurements and performs error analysis at global, part, and feature levels. Techniques include point cloud registration, primitive refinement through splitting and merging, and detection of circular holes using tensor-voting and hypothesize-and-clusterize frameworks.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of HEA-MM in accurately identifying and analyzing errors in various aircraft CAD models.

Conclusion: The proposed HEA-MM framework improves hierarchical error analysis in manufacturing environments, contributing to higher-quality aviation equipment.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSP, a framework aimed at improving oriented object detection in remote sensing using point supervision, featuring innovations in sample assignment and box extraction for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in oriented object detection for remote sensing, particularly labor-intensive annotation in high-density scenes and limitations of rule-based methods, using cost-effective point supervision.

Method: The paper proposes SSP framework leveraging Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition with two innovations: Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based Sample Assignment and Semantic Spatial Partition-based Box Extraction to enhance detection accuracy.

Result: SSP demonstrates superior performance with a 45.78% mAP under point supervision on DOTA-v1.0, significantly outperforming the existing PointOBB-v2 method, and achieves even higher mAP when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet.

Conclusion: The SSP framework effectively combines rule-driven and data-driven approaches, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for densely packed scenes in remote sensing object detection.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI is a novel method leveraging WiFi CSI measurements and a latent diffusion model to generate high-resolution images efficiently, outperforming traditional GAN-based and other techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of computationally intensive image generation methods like GANs by presenting a more efficient alternative.

Method: LatentCSI maps WiFi CSI amplitudes into a latent space using a lightweight neural network, applies a pretrained latent diffusion model for denoising with text guidance, and decodes images through this streamlined process.

Result: The approach was validated on two datasets; LatentCSI demonstrated superior computational efficiency and perceptual quality compared to direct image-trained baselines.

Conclusion: LatentCSI bypasses conventional challenges of pixel-space generation, offering efficient and controllable high-quality image synthesis using text guidance.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSTAR, a box-free approach for scene text retrieval, using attention recycling for progressive vision embedding and a multi-instance matching module to improve alignment. Additionally, the MQTR dataset is built for evaluating multi-query capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scene text retrieval are reliant on costly bounding box annotations and customized strategies, which fail to unify diverse query types.

Method: MSTAR employs progressive vision embedding for capturing multi-grained text representations, integrates a multi-instance matching module for enhanced alignment, and includes a style-aware instruction mechanism for diverse queries.

Result: Across seven public datasets and MQTR benchmark, MSTAR achieves significant performance improvements, especially surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text and outperforming models by 8.5% on average for MQTR.

Conclusion: MSTAR is effective in reducing annotation costs while delivering superior retrieval performance, marking advancements in unifying query types and scene text retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [155] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor generates consistent object textures from textual descriptions using a novel method that addresses limitations in existing approaches, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture methods face challenges such as texture property inconsistencies across viewpoints due to insufficient integration of textures, autoregressive synthesis issues, and static camera positioning. These issues hinder texture consistency and fidelity.

Method: TexTailor introduces resampling to integrate synthesized textures during the diffusion process, fine-tunes depth-aware models with performance preservation loss to balance fidelity, and adapts camera positioning based on object geometry.

Result: TexTailor demonstrates superior performance in synthesizing view-consistent textures on datasets such as Objaverse and ShapeNet cars, improving over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively addresses view consistency and fidelity challenges in texture synthesis, offering a significant improvement over existing approaches and making source code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

TL;DR: The paper develops a fine-tuning method for text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging, specifically chest X-rays, to improve clinical text-image alignment and enhance downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging is motivated by their limited application due to data privacy concerns and their inability to align clinical text with images.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning framework to enhance multi-modal alignment in pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models using chest X-ray datasets.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark dataset and robust results on out-of-distribution data from VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging enables better alignment of clinical text with relevant image areas, advancing performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a unified model for semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation using a symmetric learning objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for a unified framework that efficiently combines generative modeling with segmentation and classification tasks.

Method: SymmFlow uses a symmetric learning objective to jointly model forward and reverse transformations, maintaining semantic information and offering efficient sampling.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic image synthesis with FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff, alongside competitive segmentation and classification performance.

Conclusion: SymmFlow successfully integrates segmentation, classification, and generation tasks into a single model, highlighting its versatility and performance advantages across benchmarks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 enhances video generation quality using a fine-tuning approach that requires no manual annotations and minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for video generation rely heavily on human annotations and computational resources, which limit their practicality.

Method: GigaVideo-1 employs a prompt-driven data engine to create diverse, customized training samples and uses a reward-guided training strategy for optimization with feedback from vision-language models.

Result: GigaVideo-1 achieved a 4% average performance improvement on the VBench-2.0 benchmark, using only 4 GPU-hours and requiring no manual annotations.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 is an effective and efficient fine-tuning framework that leverages automatic feedback to significantly improve video generation capabilities with minimal resources.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents PiPViT, a prototype-based interpretability model leveraging vision transformers, designed to improve explanation quality in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods are often not human-understandable and are too granular for medical imaging, impeding clinical interpretability.

Method: The paper introduces PiPViT, utilizing vision transformers to learn human-interpretable prototypes using image-level labels. It employs contrastive learning and multi-resolution input for effective localization of lesions across scales.

Result: PiPViT was evaluated on retinal OCT datasets, demonstrating competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art while providing semantically and clinically relevant explanations.

Conclusion: PiPViT improves prototype interpretability in medical imaging, aids in diagnostic understanding, and offers transparent decision-making support for clinicians.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Subhram Dasgupta,Janelle Mason,Xiaohong Yuan,Olusola Odeyomi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight CNN for Deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and efficiency with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten information authenticity and security, presenting challenges to traditional detection methods.

Method: A lightweight CNN integrated with Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block attention for enhanced feature recalibration in Deepfake detection.

Result: The model achieved 94.14% classification accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight CNN effectively detects Deepfakes, offering an efficient and scalable solution for digital content verification.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses deep learning's vulnerabilities in traditional CAPTCHA schemes and introduces innovative techniques leveraging Large Language Models to generate adversarial CAPTCHAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are increasingly compromised by advancements in deep neural networks, necessitating solutions robust against automated attacks.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework, Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), which uses adversarial methods guided by text prompts and incorporates targeted and untargeted attack strategies enhanced through optimization techniques.

Result: BP-UAC demonstrates high attack success across various systems, producing CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to both humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions successfully enhance CAPTCHA diversity and robustness by leveraging advanced optimization and multimodal gradient methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automatic screening of minors under legal age ranges using a multi-task machine learning model robust to distribution shifts and class imbalances. It achieves improved performance metrics under rigorous benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a robust model for screening minors in unconstrained images while overcoming challenges like class imbalance and distribution shift, due to the under-representation of children in public datasets.

Method: A multi-task architecture is utilized with a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone and an MLP for age tasks. Techniques like α-reweighted focal loss, age-balanced mini-batch sampling, and an age gap strategy address class imbalances and edge case issues. Rigorous evaluation benchmarks were introduced.

Result: The proposed model significantly improves performance in under-age and age regression tasks, achieving better F2 scores and recall metrics under both controlled and real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The multi-age model showcases strong generalization capabilities and improved robustness, especially under challenging conditions, advancing automatic minor screening techniques.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm using hyperbolic space, effectively handles simultaneous instance and class recognition, validated on the EgoObjects dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods inadequately address tasks requiring simultaneous instance and class recognition, which is necessary for applications like robotics and autonomous vehicles.

Method: Introduced HyperCLIC, which leverages hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical relationships, along with hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives. New hierarchical metrics are also developed for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on the EgoObjects dataset demonstrated HyperCLIC's ability to operate across multiple granularities and achieve better hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: By utilizing hyperbolic embeddings and hierarchical metrics, HyperCLIC improves continual learning models' capability to manage both fine-grained and coarse-grained recognition, better reflecting real-world requirements.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative refinement framework called UMBD to enhance Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) by addressing poor segmentation areas with uncertainty-guided masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods have room for improvement in post-processing refinement, and this potential has not been fully explored.

Method: The authors propose the UMBD model, which selectively refines poor segmentation areas using Bernoulli diffusion guided by uncertainty masking. It incorporates HUQNet, a network that fuses multiple uncertainty sources to enhance guidance.

Result: The framework improves COD performance by an average of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure across benchmarks, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The UMBD model effectively enhances existing COD models through targeted refinement, showing the benefits of combining generative and discriminative methods for COD.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method to create synthetic golden standards for defect detection in Indium-Phosphide (InP) semiconductor manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InP wafer manufacturing suffers from a lack of golden standards due to low production scale and high design variability, making defect detection labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: The authors develop a deep neural network to generate photo-realistic synthetic InP wafer images from CAD data, and compare this method to a baseline decision-tree-based approach.

Result: The deep learning method outperforms the baseline and demonstrates the ability to generate synthetic golden dies for defect detection effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method facilitates more efficient defect detection in undefined regions of an InP wafer, improving productivity in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IQE-CLIP, a model enhancing CLIP for anomaly detection in the medical field by creating embeddings with integrated textual and instance-aware visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the limitations of existing CLIP-based methods in anomaly detection tasks, particularly in the medical domain, where there is a lack of exploration.

Method: Developed IQE-CLIP, which uses class-based and learnable prompting tokens, as well as an instance-aware query module for generating anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection, validated across six medical datasets.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP effectively addresses limitations in CLIP-based approaches for the medical domain, showing superior results in anomaly detection while integrating context-aware information.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PosterCraft, a unified model for generating aesthetic posters efficiently with artistic coherence, abandoning modular pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating posters requires artistic abstraction, text rendering, and visual harmony, which demands more sophisticated solutions compared to generic image designs.

Method: PosterCraft employs a cascaded framework including text-rendering optimization, region-aware fine-tuning, reinforcement learning with aesthetic preference, and vision-language feedback refinement using custom datasets.

Result: PosterCraft surpasses open-source baselines in rendering quality, composition coherence, and aesthetics, nearing the quality of commercial systems.

Conclusion: PosterCraft demonstrates effective poster generation with cohesive design quality and high visual appeal through innovative methodologies, providing a benchmark for future endeavors.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) method introduces a novel way to achieve ultra-large image upsampling, addressing existing challenges like blurring and distribution drift, resulting in significant performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution methods struggle with performance drops, especially for ultra-large upsampling beyond training data ranges, causing blurring and loss of quality.

Method: The method relies on a Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), utilizing stroke vector amplifiers to break images into vector sequences for magnification and implementing a detail completion module to restore details. Iterative cycles refine details without retraining for ultra-large upsampling.

Result: The technique eliminates artifacts, noise, and blurring while achieving high-quality image reconstruction, significantly outperforming existing methods in ultra-large upsampling, including impressive performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SbCA provides a robust and unified framework for ultra-large upsampling tasks, addressing critical issues such as distribution drift, and delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model called SlotPi that integrates physical knowledge and object-centric reasoning to accurately simulate and predict real-world dynamics including fluids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of physical knowledge integration and scenario adaptability in existing object-centric dynamic simulation models.

Method: Developed SlotPi, a model combining Hamiltonian-based physical modules with spatio-temporal prediction for accurate simulations of object and fluid dynamics.

Result: SlotPi showed strong performance in prediction tasks and VQA on both benchmark and newly created real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SlotPi demonstrates robust adaptability and lays the groundwork for more advanced world modeling systems capable of handling diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image-based navigation systems suffer from motion blur and latency issues, making them less suitable for dynamic environments. This paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging event cameras.

Method: The method combines event-based perception with range sensing and reinforcement learning (using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient). An initial imitation learning phase is used to increase sample efficiency.

Result: The system achieves promising performance in simulated environments, showing capabilities like robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Event cameras and reinforcement learning can significantly improve robot navigation by overcoming the drawbacks of conventional approaches like fixed-rate image processing and associated delays.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Prompts-to-Summaries, a zero-shot video summarization method utilizing video-language models (VidLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate user-guided video summaries, outperforming unsupervised methods without any training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of flexible and user-controllable summarization for video data without requiring domain-specific training.

Method: The pipeline segments videos into scenes, processes them using off-the-shelf VidLMs for descriptions, assigns importance scores through LLMs, and refines these scores using temporal consistency and novelty metrics.

Result: Achieved performance surpassing all unsupervised methods on benchmarks SumMe and TVSum and showed competitiveness on QFVS without training data. Released VidSum-Reason dataset for further research.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models combined with strategic prompting and score propagation offer a strong basis for universal, text-queryable video summarization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

*Hang Zhang,Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Rongguang Wang,Jinwei Zhang,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Gaolei Li,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work presents SmoothProper, an enhancement to unsupervised deformable image registration (DIR) for better handling of smooth and sparse image features like retinal vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised DIR methods struggle with images having sparse features and large smooth regions due to aperture and large-displacement challenges, and current methods lack post-training deformation constraints.

Method: The authors propose SmoothProper, a module with a duality-based optimization layer and tailored interaction terms that enforce smoothness, enable spatial flow propagation, and preserve structural consistency.

Result: SmoothProper showed significant improvement, reducing registration error to 1.88 pixels on high-resolution (2912x2912) retinal vessel images.

Conclusion: SmoothProper effectively handles key challenges in unsupervised DIR of sparse and smooth images, offering a plug-and-play, model-agnostic module that reduces errors and eliminates regularizer tuning.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces HOMAE, a novel occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method using masked autoencoders, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges posed by severe occlusions in hand-object interactions, where existing methods fail to effectively reason about global structures.

Method: The method incorporates a target-focused masking strategy for occlusion simulation, a signed distance field to capture geometry, and a fusion of implicit SDF with explicit point cloud for robust pose estimation.

Result: HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks for hand-object pose estimation.

Conclusion: HOMAE is effective due to its ability to handle occlusions through advanced structural perception and reasoning, and its code and models will be released for public use.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

*Huaying Yuan,Zheng Liu,Junjie Zhou,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoDeepResearch, a novel framework for long video understanding that combines text-based reasoning with modular multi-modal tools, achieving significant improvements over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges in long video understanding tasks while overcoming limitations of context window constraints in current multi-modal large language models.

Method: The framework uses a text-only large reasoning model integrated with modular multimodal tools, including visual perceivers and multimodal retrievers. It formulates problem-solving strategies through reasoning and selectively accesses needed video content via tool usage.

Result: VideoDeepResearch outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by notable margins: improvements of 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on LVU benchmarks MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic systems, like VideoDeepResearch, can tackle LVU tasks effectively without relying on extended-context multi-modal models, challenging conventional assumptions in the field.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [175] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting models, achieving high accuracy and significant computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is computationally intensive and challenging to deploy on resource-limited devices. Quantization can address this issue, but PTQ techniques for video matting are underdeveloped and struggle with accuracy and temporal coherence.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage PTQ strategy (initial block-reconstruction optimization and global calibration), a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method to address statistical distortions, and Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) to leverage temporal and semantic priors.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in quantized video matting, with the 4-bit PTQ4VM delivering results close to full-precision models and achieving up to 8x FLOP savings.

Conclusion: The new PTQ framework demonstrates that video matting models can attain near full-precision performance under low-bit quantization, making deployment on constrained devices feasible and efficient.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench introduces a novel long narrative video benchmark with 1,010 videos and 9,468 human-labeled multi-step questions, focusing on evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning and temporal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark methods fail to assess temporal reasoning and procedural validity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors curated 1,010 long videos with coherent multi-step reasoning chains using expert-reviewed filters and developed a human-AI framework for generating diverse reasoning tasks. They evaluated 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs with a new scoring system.

Result: The study provides comprehensive evaluations of existing large models and proposes new metrics for analyzing their performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VRBench offers a valuable resource for enhancing multi-step reasoning evaluation in AI, emphasizing temporal and procedural reasoning robustly.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable multi-layer graphic compositions from natural-language instructions or assets, surpassing existing AI tools with enhanced capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of creating high-quality, editable, and visually appealing graphic designs, especially for beginners, as current AI tools struggle with user-supplied assets, editability, and professional appeal.

Method: The paper proposes a two-step approach: (1) A protocol RGBA multimodal model generates JSON specifications for layer details and background prompts. (2) A conditional background model synthesizes a coherent background based on the foreground layers.

Result: CreatiPoster outperforms leading open-source and commercial systems, as validated by a benchmark with automated metrics on graphic design generation tasks.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster advances AI-assisted graphic design with diverse applications, releasing a copyright-free dataset of 100,000 designs to promote continued research in this area.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [178] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving zero-shot generative model adaptation using an approach called Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) that addresses misalignment between text and image offsets in the CLIP embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent ZSGM approaches suffer from degraded image quality due to the assumption of complete alignment between text and image offsets in the CLIP embedding space, which often does not hold true.

Method: The paper first empirically examines offset misalignment in the CLIP embedding space across large datasets and identifies its correlation with concept distance. Building on this, it introduces AIR, a novel iterative method to adapt pre-trained generators for better target image quality.

Result: Experiments across 26 setups demonstrate that AIR significantly outperforms existing methods in both quality and user satisfaction, though further validation details are available in supplementary materials.

Conclusion: The findings and the proposed AIR approach highlight the role of addressing offset misalignment for achieving higher quality ZSGM outputs, establishing a new state-of-the-art standard.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-video generation enhanced with M4V framework reduces computational costs and improves visual quality through multi-modal diffusion and reward learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the computational demands and visual quality challenges in text-to-video generation, particularly using Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity.

Method: It introduces a framework called M4V utilizing a Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba block for efficient multi-modal and spatiotemporal modeling, alongside a reward learning strategy.

Result: M4V achieved a 45% reduction in FLOPs for video generation at 768×1280 resolution and demonstrated improved visual realism in long-context autoregressive tasks.

Conclusion: M4V effectively contributes to producing high-quality videos with significantly reduced computational overheads, promoting scalability for practical applications in text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

TL;DR: This paper explores training an in-context image editing model directly from videos using a block-causal diffusion transformer, achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-turn image editing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context image editing methods rely heavily on task-specific pipelines and curated data. The paper aims to investigate whether such models can be learned directly from videos to streamline and improve the process.

Method: The authors use a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on annotated video-based datasets, applying proxy tasks like next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.

Result: The proposed model performs strongly in in-context image editing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks, and demonstrates versatility in applications like multi-concept composition and story generation.

Conclusion: The study establishes that video data can be effectively utilized to train an in-context image editing model, paving the way for scalable and generalized approaches in image editing.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectralAR, a framework for autoregressive visual generation that organizes image data into spectral tokens instead of spatial patches, enhancing causality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the causality and token efficiency in autoregressive visual generation, which has scalability advantages compared to diffusion models but struggles with the inherent parallel nature of spatial patches.

Method: The authors transform images into ordered spectral tokens through Nested Spectral Tokenization and generate sequences autoregressively from coarse to fine details.

Result: SpectralAR demonstrates competitive performance on ImageNet-1K, achieving 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and a 310M parameter model.

Conclusion: SpectralAR proves to be a highly efficient and causally consistent autoregressive visual generation framework by leveraging spectral tokenization without requiring complex techniques.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

TL;DR: This paper introduces knowledge image generation as a task and the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation Benchmark (MMMG) for evaluating text-to-image models’ capability in reasoning and generating explanatory visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of effective evaluation and generation methods for knowledge images, which are pivotal for human learning and reasoning.

Method: They proposed the MMMG benchmark, comprising 4,456 validated image-prompt pairs and a unified Knowledge Graph representation for evaluation. Additionally, they introduced the MMMG-Score metric that combines factual fidelity and visual clarity.

Result: Evaluations showed significant reasoning deficits in 16 existing text-to-image models, with performance scores like GPT-4o achieving 50.20. An open baseline model, FLUX-Reason, achieved a score of 34.45.

Conclusion: Current image generation models struggle with reasoning and generating quality knowledge images. The MMMG benchmark and metrics will drive improvement in multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CDPruner, a novel method for pruning visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by maximizing conditional diversity, achieving state-of-the-art results with substantial computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in processing large volumes of visual tokens in MLLMs by overcoming limitations of existing pruning methods that fail to fully consider instruction relevance or eliminate redundant tokens effectively.

Method: The authors propose CDPruner, a training-free and model-agnostic method using determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of retained visual tokens, ensuring that the most representative tokens are selected based on the instruction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPruner achieves state-of-the-art results on vision-language benchmarks, significantly reduces computational cost (FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78%), and maintains 94% of the original accuracy when applied to LLaVA.

Conclusion: CDPruner effectively improves the efficiency of MLLMs by pruning visual tokens based on conditional diversity, preserving high performance while reducing inference costs. The method is flexible, enabling application across a variety of models.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

Motivation: The rapid growth of video generation tools poses risks to information credibility, creating a need for reliable detection methods. However, the lack of realistic datasets hampers progress in this domain.

Method: The paper introduces GenWorld, a large-scale dataset containing realistic AI-generated videos produced by advanced models with diverse prompts. It also proposes SpannDetector, a detection method focusing on multi-view consistency for identifying generated content.

Result: Experiments indicate that SpannDetector outperforms existing methods, particularly in detecting high-quality AI-generated videos created by world models such as Cosmos.

Conclusion: The authors suggest that GenWorld and SpannDetector can significantly advance the field of AI-generated video detection by improving reliability and fostering explainable detection methods.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a superquadric-based representation for efficient 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, outperforming dense voxel and Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D occupancy prediction methods often lack efficiency due to dense voxel-based representations or limitations of sparse Gaussian-based models, particularly when modeling diverse geometric structures in driving scenes.

Method: The paper introduces a probabilistic superquadric mixture model and a system called QuadricFormer, which uses superquadrics as scene primitives and includes a pruning-and-splitting module to enhance modeling efficiency.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Superquadric representations are an effective and efficient alternative for 3D occupancy prediction, offering improved performance in real-world driving scenarios while requiring fewer primitives.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework for fine-grained attention perturbation in diffusion models, allowing targeted control over visual attributes and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where and how to apply perturbations, particularly at granular levels like individual attention heads in Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Method: The authors propose 'HeadHunter,' a mechanism to iteratively choose attention heads aligned with desired objectives and 'SoftPAG,' a continuous tuning system for perturbation strength through the identity matrix interpolation of attention maps.

Result: Empirically validated on DiT-based models such as Stable Diffusion 3, the method improves both general quality and style-specific control of generated images, addressing oversmoothing and enabling composable manipulation of visual styles.

Conclusion: The study provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, revealing head specialization and enabling the design of effective, interpretable, and targeted strategies for enhancing and controlling generation quality.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast 3D scene inpainting framework achieving real-time results within 0.4 seconds, overcoming the inefficiency of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene inpainting methods are too slow and computationally intensive for real-time or interactive use in virtual and augmented reality applications, necessitating a faster alternative.

Method: The paper presents InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework, which uses a custom large reconstruction model (LRM) and a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy. It processes 2D inpainting proposals to complete 3D scenes efficiently.

Result: InstaInpaint is 1000 times faster than prior methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks. It also generalizes to tasks like object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint addresses the limitations of previous methods by delivering efficient and effective 3D scene inpainting suitable for real-time applications, broadening its utility for virtual/augmented reality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [188] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "SceneCompleter," a novel framework for 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis using a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model and a scene embedder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for novel view synthesis rely heavily on dense multi-view captures and focus on 2D image completion before reconstructing in 3D, often leading to suboptimal geometry and visual coherence.

Method: SceneCompleter utilizes a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model for RGBD synthesis and a scene embedder to capture holistic scene understanding. These components integrate structural and textural data for improved synthesis.

Result: The method shows superior visual coherence and more plausible 3D-consistent generative results compared to prior approaches across varied datasets.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, advancing the quality of generative novel view synthesis with enhanced 3D consistency and visual plausibility.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Motivation: To understand how sparse matrix reordering can optimize performance on multicore CPUs by reducing data movement and improving load balance.

Method: The study evaluates different reordering strategies for sparse matrix-vector multiplication regarding performance gains on various multicore CPU platforms, in both sequential and parallel execution.

Result: The paper identifies performance differences based on reordering strategies, measurement methodologies, machine consistency, and load imbalance effects.

Conclusion: Sparse matrix reordering is a viable strategy for enhancing sparse matrix-vector multiplication performance, though its effectiveness can depend on reordering strategy, platform, and execution mode.

Abstract: This work evaluates the impact of sparse matrix reordering on the performance
of sparse matrix-vector multiplication across different multicore CPU
platforms. Reordering can significantly enhance performance by optimizing the
non-zero element patterns to reduce total data movement and improve the
load-balancing. We examine how these gains vary over different CPUs for
different reordering strategies, focusing on both sequential and parallel
execution. We address multiple aspects, including appropriate measurement
methodology, comparison across different kinds of reordering strategies,
consistency across machines, and impact of load imbalance.

TL;DR: An automated framework is developed for optimizing software component distribution and replication across heterogeneous hardware to enhance system resilience under failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining system resilience in complex, heterogeneous hardware environments during failures.

Method: State-space exploration algorithm with optimizations like quotient reduction using a novel equivalence relation.

Result: Experimental application of the framework demonstrated its effectiveness on an autonomous driving system model.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides resilient initial configurations and reconfiguration policies to handle system failures and recoveries.

Abstract: This paper presents a powerful automated framework for making complex systems
resilient under failures, by optimized adaptive distribution and replication of
interdependent software components across heterogeneous hardware components
with widely varying capabilities. A configuration specifies how software is
distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer,
which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use,
etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience
requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are
resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines
reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This
model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates
powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel
equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from
successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in CUDA code portability to non-CUDA platforms by leveraging AI-driven techniques to generate high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, with experimental validation showing improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of deep learning demands efficient parallel computing solutions, particularly translating CUDA code to non-CUDA platforms, which is hindered by computational and architectural differences.

Method: They propose a framework combining AI compilers, automatic optimizations, and a graph-based data augmentation technique. Additionally, they introduce a benchmark called HPCTransEval for evaluating performance in CUDA transpilation.

Result: Experiments focusing on CUDA-to-CPU code conversion show that their framework enhances LLM performance in high-performance code transpilation, resolving interoperability issues.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant promise in addressing the compatibility challenges of CUDA software ecosystems, leveraging LLMs for more effective and generalizable solutions.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of achieving both energy efficiency and model accuracy in federated learning, highlighted by device and data heterogeneity.

Method: FedJoule applies a novel bi-level integer linear programming (ILP) approach, using approximate Shapley values and energy-time prediction models for efficient client selection.

Result: FedJoule outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training accuracy and time efficiency, achieving improvements of 15% in accuracy and 48% in time across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FedJoule demonstrates an effective balance between energy usage and performance, marking a significant step in sustainable AI practices within FL environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, optimizing both
energy efficiency and model accuracy remains a challenge, given device and data
heterogeneity. Further, sustainable AI through a global energy budget for FL
has not been explored. We propose a novel optimization problem for client
selection in FL that maximizes the model accuracy within an overall energy
limit and reduces training time. We solve this with a unique bi-level ILP
formulation that leverages approximate Shapley values and energy-time
prediction models to efficiently solve this. Our FedJoule framework achieves
superior training accuracies compared to SOTA and simple baselines for diverse
energy budgets, non-IID distributions, and realistic experiment configurations,
performing 15% and 48% better on accuracy and time, respectively. The results
highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a viable trade-off
between energy usage and performance in FL environments.

*Joanna Georgiou,Moysis Symeonides,George Pallis,Marios D. Dikaiakos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an auto-benchmarking framework to address multi-tenancy performance concerns in Edge Computing by analyzing various workloads and hardware configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address security and performance issues caused by resource contention in multi-tenant Edge Computing environments.

Method: The paper introduces an auto-benchmarking framework that integrates monitoring tools and diverse benchmarking workloads for streamlined analysis.

Result: The framework analyzes multi-tenancy impacts on Edge environments through case-driven experimentation across different hardware setups and workloads.

Conclusion: The framework effectively streamlines multi-tenancy performance analysis, and its implementation is made publicly available, offering valuable insights for Edge Computing administrators.

Abstract: Edge Computing emerges as a promising alternative of Cloud Computing, with
scalable compute resources and services deployed in the path between IoT
devices and Cloud. Since virtualization techniques can be applied on Edge
compute nodes, administrators can share their Edge infrastructures among
multiple users, providing the so-called multi-tenancy. Even though
multi-tenancy is unavoidable, it raises concerns about security and performance
degradation due to resource contention in Edge Computing. For that,
administrators need to deploy services with non-antagonizing profiles and
explore workload co-location scenarios to enhance performance and energy
consumption. Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,
deployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and
time-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an
auto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of
multi-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a
built-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking
workloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning
applications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven
analysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge
environments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.
Finally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized
workloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.

### [194] [TD-Pipe: Temporally-Disaggregated Pipeline Parallelism Architecture for High-Throughput LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10470)
*Hongbin Zhang,Taosheng Wei,Zhenyi Zheng,Jiangsu Du,Zhiguang Chen,Yutong Lu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces TD-Pipe, a new architecture to optimize pipeline parallelism for LLM inference, reducing performance issues and boosting throughput significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pipeline parallelism is promising for large language models (LLMs), but suffers from performance problems due to imbalanced workloads and dependencies during prefill and decode phases.

Method: The authors propose TD-Pipe, featuring temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism, hierarchy-based device control, AI-based prefill predictions, inter-batch work stealing, and spatial-temporal analysis for optimization.

Result: Experimental results reveal throughput gains of up to 1.91x compared to tensor parallel approaches and 2.73x relative to existing pipeline parallel methods on GPUs using PCIe connectivity.

Conclusion: TD-Pipe successfully enhances throughput for LLM inference by addressing the inefficiencies in pipeline parallelism, making it a valuable approach for maximizing computational performance.

Abstract: As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great
promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on
communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data
dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline
bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the
pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,
with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism
architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and
decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles
caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of
exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a
hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline
parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based
greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the
output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work
stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different
batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison
approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the
performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase
switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively
increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing
tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach
on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel digital twin architecture (HP2C-DT) that effectively integrates edge, cloud, and HPC resources to address computational efficiency and latency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional digital twin architectures face challenges balancing real-time responsiveness with computational demands due to limitations of both cloud and edge-based infrastructures.

Method: The paper presents the HP2C-DT architecture which dynamically assigns computational tasks based on urgency and performance needs across edge, cloud, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, leveraging the COMPSs framework.

Result: Evaluation in a power grid use case showed significant improvements, including reduced communication bandwidth (order of magnitude), faster response times (up to 2x), and strong scaling capabilities across diverse resources.

Conclusion: The proposed HPC-driven approach redefines digital twin capabilities, making them more efficient and suited for complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control
physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time
responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge.
Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints,
while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations
and data-driven optimizations.
  To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance
Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which
integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum.
Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT
makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks
to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs.
  Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the
HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless
workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power
grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of
magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to
2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for
compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These
results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond
their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of
handling real-world complexity.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient graph-based gossiping mechanism for decentralized learning, significantly improving communication efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address communication inefficiencies in decentralized learning setups and bridge the gap between existing studies and real-world distributed environments.

Method: They leverage minimum spanning tree and graph coloring techniques to optimize network structure and scheduling, simulating realistic setups with physical routers and devices.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improvements in communication efficiency, reducing bandwidth usage by up to 8x and transfer time by up to 4.4x compared to naive methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances decentralized learning communication, making it suitable for diverse network topologies and practical distributed setups.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for
collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its
reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks
of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as
decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role
across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure
decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise
from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing
proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and
decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable
performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the
lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model
size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized
learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where
specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize
network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various
network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages
subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world
distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and
data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4
times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

### [201] [The Impact of Partial Computations on the Red-Blue Pebble Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10854)
*Pál András Papp,Aleksandros Sobczyk,A. N. Yzelman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper extends the red-blue pebble game (RBP) by introducing partial computation steps, leading to more realistic modeling of computational I/O costs. Such extensions can reduce costs but introduce NP-hard optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to model computational tasks more realistically by enabling partial computation steps. The original RBP requires simultaneous input availability, but many real-world computations employ step-by-step aggregation.

Method: The authors extend the RBP to the partial-computing red-blue pebble game (PRBP), analyze its properties, compare it with RBP, adapt tools like $S$-partitions to PRBP, and establish lower bounds and hardness results.

Result: Partial computations can reduce I/O costs by up to a linear factor. However, determining optimal costs is NP-hard. Additionally, approximating costs in PRBP is equally hard to any reasonable factor.

Conclusion: Partial computing introduces promising avenues for reducing I/O costs in specific computational models, but it brings computational complexity challenges.

Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with
partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the
original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in
fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be
aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation
steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in
settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended
red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue
pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some
simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal
I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor
this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations
allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,
a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP
model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost
of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result
from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP
to any reasonable factor.

*Waylon Luo,Jiapeng Zhao,Tong Zhan,Qiang Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in quantum computing, such as limited qubit counts and high errors, by introducing a simulation tool for distributed quantum scheduling and execution across networked QPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap between advanced quantum algorithms and the limited capabilities of current quantum hardware, which hinder scalability and computational accuracy in quantum systems.

Method: A simulation environment is proposed to model circuit decomposition and parallel execution on networked QPUs, coupled with evaluations of four scheduling techniques, including reinforcement learning-based methods.

Result: The results highlight the trade-offs between different scheduling techniques in terms of runtime, fidelity, and communication costs, showcasing the potential for improved throughput with parallel, noise-aware scheduling.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that distributed and noise-aware scheduling can significantly enhance computational efficiency and stability within quantum infrastructures.

Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited
qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all
of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement
of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum
hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,
inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine
system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads
under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource
coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,
retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to
distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to
efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum
processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we
introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and
concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time
classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that
surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through
inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare
four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by
reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,
including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.
Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and
highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve
computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.

### [203] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Models for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning under Adaptive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09999)
*Yukun Chen,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng,Hongliang Li,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new MCIL method incorporating vision, audio, and text modalities to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhance incremental learning using multimodal pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of traditional MCIL methods that focus on only vision and text by exploring multimodal learning with audio, vision, and text.

Method: The method involves developing a Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE), Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM), and a novel multimodal class-incremental contrastive training loss with specific evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments on three multimodal datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling incremental learning across modalities.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust MCIL approach capable of leveraging complementary information across multiple modalities while overcoming traditional challenges like catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaMAGIC2, improving analog topology design using a new representation method for language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern applications require customized analog circuit designs, which are heavily manual and inefficient in current methods.

Method: LaMAGIC2 employs a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) to represent circuits, enhancing precision and token length efficiency.

Result: Experiments show LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under tight tolerance and 10X lower MSEs compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 proves to be a robust and transferable solution for analog topology generation, integrating better efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), a framework combining graph representation techniques with large language models (LLMs), achieving superior generalization in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of traditional Graph Neural Networks (MPNNs) and current self-supervised methods in generalization and zero-shot applications, as well as the limitations of LLMs when applied to graphs.

Method: The NOCL framework employs two main techniques: node description (to make LLMs work beyond textual-attributed graphs), and node concept (to encode node descriptions into compact embeddings), along with graph representation descriptors to handle various graph tasks.

Result: NOCL shows competitive performance with traditional MPNNs in supervised learning and outperforms in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed NOCL framework overcomes existing limitations in graph neural networks and LLM adaptations for graphs, setting a foundation for future Graph Foundation Models.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

### [206] [Improving the performance of optical inverse design of multilayer thin films using CNN-LSTM tandem neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10044)
*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper employs deep learning, specifically a tandem neural network (TNN), for the inverse design of optical transmission spectra in multilayer thin films. It explores different neural network configurations and identifies CNN-LSTM as an optimal balance between accuracy and training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for predicting optical properties of thin films are computationally expensive and time-consuming. The paper seeks a more efficient approach through deep learning to improve inverse design procedures.

Method: The research uses tandem neural networks (TNN) for inverse design, combining forward and inverse models implemented via various neural network algorithms (MLP, CNN, LSTM). Several TNN configurations are tested to determine performance in terms of accuracy and training efficiency.

Result: The study finds that the LSTM-LSTM-based TNN achieves the highest accuracy but requires the longest training. By contrast, the CNN-LSTM configuration offers an optimal balance of high accuracy and reasonable training time.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly CNN-LSTM-based tandem neural networks, presents a promising solution for improving the efficiency and accuracy of inverse design for multilayer thin films' optical properties.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO introduces enhancements to preference optimization in RLHF by weighting sample contributions based on pair quality and model performance, leading to superior results in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods in RLHF uniformly treat preference pairs, neglecting differences in their quality and utility, which hampers optimal data utilization and model performance.

Method: Omni-DPO integrates adaptive sample weighting, considering both the quality of preference pairs and the model's dynamic learning progress during training.

Result: Experimental findings show Omni-DPO's effectiveness, with significant improvements in benchmarks such as Arena-Hard (+6.7 points) and consistent advancements in mathematical reasoning tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO demonstrates robust and generalizable capabilities, proving to be a superior optimization method for RLHF, with its models outperforming leading alternatives. Resources provided for public access.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

### [208] [Textual Bayes: Quantifying Uncertainty in LLM-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10060)
*Brendan Leigh Ross,Noël Vouitsis,Atiyeh Ashari Ghomi,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Ji Xin,Zhaoyan Liu,Yi Sui,Shiyi Hou,Kin Kwan Leung,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles uncertainty quantification for large language models (LLMs) by introducing a Bayesian perspective through textual parameters and employing a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, demonstrating accuracy and uncertainty improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs remains a major challenge, especially due to their black-box nature and sensitivity to prompts. This limits their use in critical domains.

Method: The authors approach LLMs from a Bayesian perspective, treating prompts as statistical parameters and introducing 'Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals' (MHLP), a new MCMC method. It facilitates Bayesian inference over prompts while leveraging standard LLM pipelines.

Result: Their method showed improvements in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification across various benchmarks and UQ tasks.

Conclusion: The study offers a viable way to integrate Bayesian methods into LLM systems, enhancing reliability and calibration in their use.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of optimizing latent dimension allocation in hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) for better out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve OOD detection in safety-critical applications by mitigating issues like ineffective representations and posterior collapse in existing HVAE methods.

Method: A theoretical framework based on information theory is introduced to optimize latent dimension allocation, proving the existence of an optimal allocation ratio and empirically validating its effectiveness.

Result: The proposed approach consistently enhances OOD detection performance across diverse datasets and HVAE architectures, surpassing baseline configurations.

Conclusion: Optimizing latent structure design using principled methods bolsters robust OOD detection in deep generative models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and flexibility in solving kernelized bandit problems with unknown reward functions.

Method: The authors propose GP-Generic, utilizing exploration distributions to unify and extend UCB and randomized approaches for optimized decision-making.

Result: GP-Generic demonstrates theoretical $	ilde{O}(
abla_T\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds and practical advantages of randomization.

Conclusion: Exploration distribution is a powerful tool for designing flexible and efficient kernelized bandit algorithms.

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-phase deep autoencoder system for MNIST digit clustering, enhancing clustering quality and embedding visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve unsupervised clustering for handwritten digit images, addressing challenges in representation learning and clustering accuracy.

Method: The research uses a two-phase deep autoencoder system. Phase one minimizes reconstruction errors and phase two integrates KMeans clustering with a joint objective on latent embeddings. It uses batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay for robust output.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior clustering performance via metrics such as Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, NMI, and ARI. Embeddings validated visually with t-SNE reveal clear clusters.

Conclusion: Achieving an optimal balance between reconstruction and clustering, the approach is scalable and suitable for large-scale image clustering applications.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

*Ahmed Elbakary,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel federated multi-task learning method is proposed to enhance personalized learning using efficient communication and a graph-based collaboration between clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in federated learning such as inefficient communication, handling data heterogeneity, and harmful knowledge transfer.

Method: The approach introduces a feature anchor to summarize local data, lightweight classification heads, and a dynamic graph-based regularization paired with community detection to support collaboration while preserving personalization.

Result: Experiments conducted on two heterogeneous datasets show significant outperformance against state-of-the-art baselines in terms of model accuracy, computational efficiency, communication efficiency, and fairness.

Conclusion: The presented method successfully enhances federated learning by balancing collaboration and personalization, ensuring efficient communication, and achieving fair client outcomes.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD), a generative model tailored for physically meaningful but nonnegative objects like 3D clouds, reducing computational complexity while maintaining realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world phenomena such as cloud formation are computationally expensive to simulate, necessitating scalable methods for physical modeling.

Method: The proposed NnD method uses score-based diffusion and adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to ensure non-negativity in iterative scene generation and analysis.

Result: The model effectively generates 3D volumetric clouds with nonnegative microphysical properties, consistent with actual cloud physics trends and indistinguishable from real ones by experts.

Conclusion: NnD offers a computationally efficient approach to simulate complex, real-world physical phenomena while adhering to physical constraints like non-negativity and enabling accurate generation and inference.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRAIL, a benchmarking framework for evaluating graph-based Active Learning (AL) strategies under dynamic, real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based AL methods are largely tested in static environments and focus heavily on prediction accuracy, ignoring user-related considerations like diversity and fairness.

Method: The authors propose GRAIL, which incorporates new metrics to evaluate AL strategies along dimensions like sustained effectiveness, user burden, and sampling diversity.

Result: GRAIL experimental results on dynamic human sensor datasets highlight trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, revealing limitations in existing AL methods.

Conclusion: GRAIL underscores the need for balancing prediction accuracy, diversity, and dynamic adaptability in graph AL, and offers a valuable evaluation framework for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The paper addresses decentralized learning in multi-player multi-armed bandits where players have no feedback on collisions, proposing a new algorithm for effective learning under these constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in decentralized systems where multiple players learn arm rewards without knowing collision outcomes, a scenario that generalizes existing problems with added complexity.

Method: The authors introduced A-CAPELLA, a decentralized algorithm, leveraging synchronized elimination and collision pattern strategies for efficient learning and capacity estimation.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves logarithmic regret in decentralized multi-armed bandit settings with no-sensing feedback and unknown capacities.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA demonstrates efficient learning in a complex no-sensing multi-armed bandit scenario, overcoming limitations of feedback by using structured collaboration protocols.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three novel survival models leveraging imprecise probability theory and attention mechanisms to handle censored data, offering significant improvements over traditional methods like the Beran estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Censored observations in survival analysis pose challenges for traditional nonparametric methods like the Beran estimator, especially under complex data structures and heavy censoring.

Method: The proposed models use interval-valued probability distributions for censored observations, kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with trainable attention weights, and three distinct decision strategies for training.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the iSurv models, particularly iSurvJ, in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity compared to the Beran estimator.

Conclusion: The iSurv models offer a robust alternative for survival analysis under heavy censoring, outperforming traditional estimators, and their codes are publicly accessible for further usage.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

### [217] [Provable Sim-to-Real Transfer via Offline Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10133)
*Arnaud Fickinger,Abderrahim Bendahi,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on advancing reinforcement learning via offline domain randomization (ODR) to improve sim-to-real transfer, providing theoretical foundations and a novel method called E-DROPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in performance when reinforcement-learning agents transition from simulation to real-world applications, leveraging offline data and structured randomization to improve robustness.

Method: The authors formalize ODR through maximum-likelihood estimation, prove its consistency under certain conditions, derive tighter bounds for sim-to-real gaps, and introduce E-DROPO, which employs an entropy bonus for better randomization.

Result: They demonstrate that ODR achieves a significantly tighter sim-to-real error bound compared to standard domain randomization (up to an O(M) factor), and E-DROPO improves zero-shot transfer robustness.

Conclusion: ODR is theoretically sound and offers practical improvements in robustness for sim-to-real transfer, with E-DROPO further enhancing performance by preventing variance collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

### [218] [Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10159)
*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), which extends contrastive learning methods to provide uncertainty quantification via probabilistic embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of uncertainty quantification in deterministic embeddings generated by popular contrastive learning methods like SimCLR and SupCon.

Method: VCL introduces a probabilistic framework by treating InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer. It replaces deterministic embeddings with samples from a projected normal posterior distribution.

Result: VCL reduces dimensional collapse, improves mutual information with class labels, achieves competitive classification accuracy, and offers meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL serves as a probabilistic foundation for contrastive learning methods, enhancing both performance and reliability.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

*Daniel Lawson,Adriana Hugessen,Charlotte Cloutier,Glen Berseth,Khimya Khetarpal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, a novel approach to improve combinatorial generalization in goal-conditioned behavior cloning by encoding temporal consistency through successor representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal-conditioned behavior cloning struggles with zero-shot generalization on novel state-goal pairs due to a lack of temporal consistency in learned state representations.

Method: The proposed method, BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, approximates successor representations without relying on contrastive samples or temporal-difference learning. It uses a specific representation learning objective.

Result: The method achieves competitive empirical performance on tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Conclusion: Encouraging temporal consistency via specialized learning objectives enables more robust zero-shot generalization in GCBC methods.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

### [220] [Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10177)
*Defang Chen,Zhenyu Zhou,Can Wang,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uncovers a geometric regularity in sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models, showing that sampling trajectories lie in low-dimensional subspaces with consistent shapes, and proposes a method to improve image generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the geometric properties of sampling trajectories in diffusion-based generative models and utilize them for improving image generation performance.

Method: The authors analyze deterministic sampling dynamics in generative models using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and propose a dynamic programming-based scheme for better aligning the sampling time schedule with trajectory structure.

Result: The discovered trajectory regularities are consistent across model architectures and conditions. The dynamic programming-based adjustment of sampling schedules achieved improved image generation performance, especially with low function evaluations.

Conclusion: The findings on trajectory regularity provide insights into sampling dynamics, and the proposed strategy enables enhanced efficiency and performance in image generation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reverse-engineers a convolutional RNN trained to play Sokoban, identifying mechanisms analogous to bidirectional search that improve test-time compute performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the improved performance of convolutional RNNs using test-time compute in complex problem-solving like Sokoban.

Method: Reverse-engineering a convolutional recurrent neural network trained via model-free reinforcement learning and analyzing its internal activations and components.

Result: The network employs mechanisms akin to bidirectional search, including state-action activations, directional planning, and specialized kernels, but considers each box separately instead of unified state representation.

Conclusion: Model-free trained networks can utilize test-time compute mechanisms that are interpretable and resemble classical search algorithms, providing insights into deep learning systems.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-learning method to train classifiers using noisy labels from multiple annotators, even with limited data, leveraging labeled data from related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue addressed is the challenge of learning accurate classifiers with limited noisy labeled data from annotators with varying skills and biases, a common scenario in crowdsourcing.

Method: The method constructs a probabilistic model using a neural network to map examples onto a latent space, estimates annotator abilities, and uses meta-learning and the EM algorithm for classifier adaptation with limited annotated data.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in experiments on real-world datasets with synthetic noise and actual crowdsourced annotations.

Conclusion: This meta-learning approach enables effective classifier training in scenarios with noisy labels and limited data, offering a significant tool for improving learning in crowdsourcing contexts.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) for accurate heart rate estimation using oxygen uptake (VO2) data during daily activities, outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early detection of heart failure by addressing limitations in current heart rate monitoring tools that rely on population averages.

Method: Developed a PMB-NN framework integrating a simplified physiological model into neural network training to estimate heart rate using VO2 data.

Result: Achieved a median R² score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm, outperforming traditional physiological models and matching benchmark machine learning models.

Conclusion: The PMB-NN framework enables precise individualized HR estimation, adhering to physiological principles and contributing to real-time cardiac health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Col-UCB, an algorithm for minimizing collaborative regret in grouped multi-armed bandit settings by sharing exploration and dynamically coordinating efforts across groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of imbalanced exploration costs between groups in settings where groups share overlapping feasible action sets in multi-armed bandits.

Method: The authors propose Col-UCB, an algorithm that dynamically coordinates exploration across groups, leveraging shared reward observations to minimize both collaborative minimax and instance-dependent regret.

Result: Col-UCB achieves optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) and adapts to the structure of shared action sets to determine when collaboration provides significant benefits.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully balances exploration burdens across groups and highlights when shared exploration outperforms independent learning efforts within groups.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Balanced Hyperbolic Learning to improve out-of-distribution recognition using hyperbolic hierarchical embeddings for classification and scoring, achieving superior performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to differentiate in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples effectively in deep learning.

Method: Introduce Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, optimize hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings, use them as prototypes, and adapt existing OOD scoring functions.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows improved performance in both hyperbolic and existing OOD methods across multiple datasets and scoring functions.

Conclusion: Balanced hyperbolic embeddings enhance out-of-distribution recognition and outperform existing methods while enabling hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a critical health challenge in developing nations, and existing AQI tracking mechanisms are insufficient due to sparse measurement sensors.

Method: The paper utilizes Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fine-grained AQI predictions at 1 km² resolutions, leveraging spatio-temporal data.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 79% MSE reduction compared to existing approaches and successfully predicts AQI on unseen coordinates, discovering new patterns in air pollution data.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal GNNs are an effective solution for enhancing AQI predictions, offering deeper insights into pollution patterns, and addressing existing gaps in AQI monitoring systems.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal representation learning framework to evaluate language model capabilities rigorously, controlling confounders and revealing causal relationships among latent model skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of language models is difficult due to confounding factors and computational costs. The research aims to improve causal evaluations in this domain.

Method: The authors use a causal representation learning framework, modeling benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent capability factors, and control for the base model as a confounder.

Result: The study identifies a three-node causal structure explaining performance variations, showing a progression from general problem-solving to instruction-following, then mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Controlling base model variations is critical for uncovering latent causal relationships, advancing evaluation methodologies and scientific insights into model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces WBSAC, an off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency by integrating directed exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most off-policy actor-critic algorithms perform poorly when dealing with sparse rewards, largely due to insufficient exploration during learning.

Method: The WBSAC algorithm incorporates a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for exploration. These policies are combined using the Wasserstein barycenter, adapting the exploration level as learning progresses.

Result: WBSAC outperforms state-of-the-art actor-critic methods in terms of sample efficiency on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC demonstrates that a principled directed exploration approach can lead to more sample-efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of fairness assessment in algorithmic decision-making with a size-adaptive statistical hypothesis-testing framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness assessment practices in algorithmic decision-making are statistically brittle, particularly in intersectional analyses involving small demographic subgroups.

Method: The authors introduce a statistical hypothesis-testing framework combining Central-Limit results and Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimation for fairness metrics.

Result: The proposed approach yields confidence intervals and interpretable statistical tests, validated empirically on benchmark datasets across varying scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework ensures reliable and evidence-based fairness assessments even when dealing with small or highly intersectional demographic subgroups.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

through a rigorous methodical experimentation process involving three diverse
datasets: TinyFace, Heart Disease, and Iris. Study Overview: The study includes
three key methods: a) a baseline training using the default settings for the
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), b) feature selection using Genetic Algorithm (GA)
based refinement c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based dimension
reduction. The results show important information on how such techniques affect
performance. While PCA had showed benefits in low-dimensional and noise-free
datasets GA consistently increased accuracy in complex datasets by accurately
identifying critical features. Comparison reveals that feature selection and
dimensionality reduction play interdependent roles in enhancing MLP
performance. The study contributes to the literature on feature engineering and
neural network parameter optimization, offering practical guidelines for a wide
range of machine learning tasks

### [233] [Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982)
*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares the Log Variance (LV) loss and the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss in diffusion bridge deep-learning methods, showing rKL with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) is conceptually better and provides superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness and theoretical foundations of the LV loss as compared to the rKL loss in diffusion bridge sampling and deep-learning optimization.

Method: Analyzing the conceptual foundations of LV and rKL losses, experimenting with different diffusion bridges, and comparing performance metrics and training stability.

Result: The rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) outperforms the LV loss in terms of sampling quality, hyperparameter optimization ease, and training consistency.

Conclusion: rKL-LD is more suitable than LV loss for diffusion bridge methods, providing better conceptual grounding and improved practical outcomes.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

*Yuhui Ding,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to 3D molecule generation by learning a sample-dependent alignment process, avoiding the need for specialized equivariant architectures while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equivariant architectures for 3D molecule generation, though effective, can limit scalability and computational efficiency due to their rigid symmetry constraints.

Method: The paper proposes using a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation to align molecules into a shared latent space, enabling the use of a non-equivariant diffusion model for generation.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms prior non-equivariant models and achieves sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, with better training and sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: Relaxing equivariance constraints via sample-dependent alignment enables more efficient and scalable 3D molecule generation models without compromising on performance.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

### [236] [DynaSubVAE: Adaptive Subgrouping for Scalable and Robust OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10200)
*Tina Behrouzi,Sana Tonekaboni,Rahul G. Krishnan,Anna Goldenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE proposes a dynamic approach to improving model performance on heterogeneous subpopulations through representation learning and adaptive OOD detection, outperforming standalone clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models often fail to accommodate heterogeneous subgroups in observational data, leading to biased predictions. Current solutions focus on labeling these groups as OOD without adapting models.

Method: The paper introduces DynaSubVAE, a framework combining variational autoencoders with dynamic subgroup discovery via non-parametric clustering inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: Experimental results show DynaSubVAE excels in OOD detection tasks, including class-OOD scenarios, outperforming standalone clustering techniques like GMM and KMeans++.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE's dynamic and adaptive methodology provides a significant improvement in handling emerging subpopulations compared to conventional clustering and detection approaches.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified method, called Activation-aware Weight Pruning (AWP), using projected gradient descent to enhance quantization and pruning of large language models, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of large language models makes deployment on edge devices challenging, necessitating efficient compression methods like quantization and pruning.

Method: The paper employs layer-wise post-training quantization and pruning, drawing parallels with sparse approximation problems, and uses Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) as inspiration for the proposed AWP method.

Result: Experiments show that AWP surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for pruning and quantization of large language models. Furthermore, the method has theoretical convergence guarantees for pruning.

Conclusion: The AWP method is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of large language models through effective post-training quantization and pruning approaches.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between ECG and PCG cardiac signals, demonstrating mutual reconstruction, variability with exercise, and cross-subject generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the distinct and overlapping features of ECG and PCG signals to assess their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, especially under diverse conditions.

Method: The authors analyze ECG-PCG data using the EPHNOGRAM dataset with linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, focusing on reconstruction and cross-subject variability.

Result: Nonlinear models perform better for signal reconstruction, with ECG from PCG being more effective. Challenges emerge under exercise and cross-subject settings, but envelope-based modeling improves generalizability. ECG biomarkers are extractable from PCG.

Conclusion: The study enriches insights into ECG and PCG relationships, offering advancements in waveform characteristics, cardiac event timing, and applications in multimodal cardiac monitoring.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Collaboration Clustering (DC-Clustering), a federated clustering method allowing effective clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios, using intermediate representations to preserve privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing federated clustering methods which fail to handle complex data partitioning scenarios, while ensuring privacy preservation for sensitive data.

Method: The proposed method, DC-Clustering, enables clustering over horizontal and vertical data splits using shared intermediate representations, supports k-means and spectral clustering, and requires only one communication round with the server.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets showed that DC-Clustering achieves clustering performance similar to centralized methods where all data are pooled.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering offers a privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and flexible approach for federated clustering, filling a gap in FL research and proving useful in domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDP relaxations for DNN verification encounter scalability issues due to interior-point vanishing as network depth increases. The paper proposes five solutions addressing this problem, improving problem-solving success by 41%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability problem of semidefinite programming in DNN verification caused by the loss of strict feasibility with increasing network depth.

Method: The authors conducted theoretical and empirical analysis to identify the problem and designed five strategies to enhance feasibility conditions in verification problems. They also examined the constraints used for ReLU units.

Result: The proposed methods resolved 88% of previously unsolvable problems, representing 41% of the total. Additionally, the work identified flaws in inherited constraints for ReLU units.

Conclusion: This study highlights critical challenges in scaling SDP-based DNN verification, proposes actionable solutions, and provides insights for better reliability and scalability in neural network verification.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

### [241] [Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282)
*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal graph learning to fairly evaluate three paradigms of learning: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal graph learning lack a unified benchmark, making it challenging to evaluate progress across different approaches.

Method: The authors proposed Graph-MLLM, a systematic benchmark for comparing multimodal graph learning methods across six domain-specific datasets.

Result: Experimental findings show improved performance when combining visual and textual attributes and reveal that fine-tuning multimodal large language models yields state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM provides a framework for equitable evaluation and has potential to drive innovation in multimodal graph learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

*Luc Raszewski,Christine De Kock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-learning approach to detect malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia, enhancing precision especially in cases with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving sockpuppet detection is essential to maintain the trustworthiness of Wikipedia against disinformation.

Method: The authors employ meta-learning to enable faster adaptation to the writing style of specific sockpuppet-groups in data-scarce scenarios.

Result: Meta-learning models significantly outperform existing pre-trained methods in prediction accuracy for sockpuppetry.

Conclusion: Meta-learning offers a promising solution for sockpuppet detection, and the release of a new dataset encourages further exploration in this field.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents PyLO, a PyTorch-based library for learned optimizers, enhancing accessibility and offering significant speed improvements, particularly for large-scale pre-training tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned optimizers like VeLO have been inaccessible to many due to reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly implementations post-meta-training. This paper aims to make learned optimization accessible to the broader ML community.

Method: The authors created PyLO, a PyTorch-based library, and integrated CUDA acceleration for the small_fc_lopt optimizer. They emphasize real-world pre-training tasks and support integration with existing optimization tools.

Result: PyLO delivers significant throughput improvements, e.g., 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec for training ViT B/16. Combining learned optimizers with existing tools like learning rate scheduling further enhances performance.

Conclusion: PyLO democratizes learned optimizers by leveraging PyTorch and familiar workflows, unlocking their potential for real-world machine learning tasks. The library is released openly for community use.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper formalizes the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, introduces the transfer eluder dimension to measure its complexity, and proposes the HELiX algorithm for efficient learning with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has prompted interest in learning through observation and language feedback, but a principled understanding of decision problems in this area is lacking.

Method: The authors utilized a formalization of LLF problems, introduced the transfer eluder dimension to measure problem complexity, and designed the HELiX algorithm with no-regret properties for solving LLF scenarios through interactive learning.

Result: The HELiX algorithm demonstrated strong performance across several empirical domains, significantly outperforming repeated prompting of LLMs in cases where LLMs alone were unreliable.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework and tools for designing interactive learning algorithms that leverage generic language feedback effectively, marking an important advancement in this domain.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: Physiological signal analysis is improved using a novel wavelet-based approach with pre-trained models and a unified multi-modal framework to enhance performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in physiological signal analysis like motion artifacts, non-stationarity, and inter-subject variability by proposing enhanced methodologies.

Method: A wavelet-based technique is developed for capturing multi-scale time-frequency features coupled with large-scale pre-trained models for EMG, ECG, and a unified multi-modal framework integrating EEG analysis.

Result: Superior performance achieved with pre-trained models setting new baselines and a unified multi-modal framework overcoming traditional issues in physiological signal processing.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture establishes a solid foundation for physiological signal analysis, promising advancements in wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical fields.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an end-to-end learning framework that models path-dependent inelastic material behavior using neural operators. It excels in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness under complex conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and instability issues in recurrent neural network-based models for simulating path-dependent inelastic materials.

Method: The paper proposes HANO, an autoregressive model built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone, utilizing hierarchical self-attention for multiscale feature extraction and avoiding reliance on hidden state variables.

Result: HANO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models in benchmarks for elastoplasticity and anisotropic damage in brittle solids, excelling in predictive accuracy and robustness under complex conditions.

Conclusion: HANO is a promising data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and can effectively integrate with traditional numerical solvers for varied and irregular loading paths.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiency in continual learning for large pre-trained models due to their high computational and parameter demands.

Method: TreeLoRA constructs layer-wise low-rank adapters using hierarchical gradient similarity and relies on bandit techniques and sparse gradient updates for efficient task structure exploration and optimization.

Result: The method demonstrates improved effectiveness and efficiency in continual learning tasks across domains, validated through experiments on vision transformers and large language models.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA enhances continual learning for large pre-trained models by balancing computational efficiency with knowledge preservation, showing promise in both vision and NLP tasks.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

### [248] [Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364)
*Penguin Huang,Chhavi Yadav,Ruihan Wu,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark to evaluate property inference vulnerabilities in fine-tuned language models, and proposes novel attack methods that identify hidden dataset-level properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to study property inference attacks on LLMs, as these attacks could compromise the confidentiality of sensitive dataset-level properties in domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: The authors developed the PropInfer benchmark, conducted evaluations on the ChatDoctor dataset, and proposed two novel attack strategies: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack based on word frequency analysis.

Result: Empirical tests on multiple pretrained LLMs demonstrated that the proposed attacks successfully infer dataset-level properties, highlighting a vulnerability in fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific data are susceptible to property inference attacks, posing risks to sensitive and confidential dataset-level information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EQA-RM, a multimodal reward model designed for Embodied Question Answering (EQA), providing structured feedback and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic reward approaches for Embodied Question Answering fail to capture nuanced spatial, temporal, and logical understanding, necessitating specialized reward models.

Method: The paper proposes EQA-RM, trained using the novel Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), and introduces the benchmark EQARewardBench for model assessment.

Result: EQA-RM achieves 61.9% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench using only 700 samples, surpassing proprietary and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: EQA-RM offers highly efficient and interpretable performance for EQA tasks, filling gaps in nuanced task evaluation, with accessible code and dataset.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700
samples, outperforming strong proprietary baselines, including

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAJAMA, which synthesizes executable judging programs using LLMs for quality assessment, addressing high cost, bias, and inflexibility in LLM-as-a-judge setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high API costs, reliability issues, inflexible evaluation pipelines, and inherent biases in using LLMs as evaluators.

Method: PAJAMA synthesizes and uses executable judging programs created by LLMs to evaluate responses rather than scoring directly.

Result: PAJAMA reduced bias and improved judgment consistency compared to LLM-as-a-judge systems. It also outperformed existing models on benchmarks while being significantly cheaper.

Conclusion: PAJAMA offers a cost-effective, interpretable, and unbiased alternative for automated model assessment by leveraging program-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

### [251] [Generative Algorithms for Wildfire Progression Reconstruction from Multi-Modal Satellite Active Fire Measurements and Terrain Height](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10404)
*Bryan Shaddy,Brianna Binder,Agnimitra Dasgupta,Haitong Qin,James Haley,Angel Farguell,Kyle Hilburn,Derek V. Mallia,Adam Kochanski,Jan Mandel,Assad Oberai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for predicting wildfire progression using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on wildfire simulation data, incorporating satellite measurements and terrain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing wildfire occurrences highlight the need for accurate multi-day simulation and prediction methods that incorporate real-time data to match atmospheric state changes.

Method: The study utilizes a conditional GAN trained on WRF-SFIRE wildfire simulation data to estimate fire arrival time from VIIRS measurements, GOES ignition times, and terrain height. Historical data is used for training without requiring real satellite data, making the approach flexible and grounded in physics.

Result: Validation on five US wildfires shows the approach achieves an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81, indicating strong performance when compared against high-resolution aircraft-measured perimeters.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effective integration of various data sources for estimating wildfire progression while showing that terrain height has limited influence when using satellite-based measurements.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

*Ching Chang,Jeehyun Hwang,Yidan Shi,Haixin Wang,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new dataset and benchmark library called Time-IMM and IMM-TSF are introduced for analyzing time series data which are often irregular and complex in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume idealized conditions for time series data (regular, clean, and unimodal), which diverge significantly from the messy, irregular, and multimodal data seen in real-world settings.

Method: The authors develop the Time-IMM dataset, capturing nine types of time series irregularities, and the IMM-TSF library, which provides specialized modules for asynchronous multimodal integration based on recency-aware averaging and attention mechanisms.

Result: Empirical studies show that explicitly modeling multimodality and irregularity improves forecasting performance for time series data.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF aim to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications, fostering advancements in time series analysis under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a hybrid method combining spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to improve soil organic carbon (SOC) sampling's representativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC monitoring typically depends on selecting field locations using covariates, which may miss minor but important environmental clusters.

Method: The study utilizes spectral clustering to partition areas into homogeneous zones and applies cLHS within these zones to ensure comprehensive environmental representation during sampling.

Result: The hybrid spectral-cLHS method achieves more uniform coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The new hybrid method enhances SOC sampling design, potentially leading to more precise SOC predictions by improving training data quality for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability
for system identification in modern industrial systems.

Conclusion: END offers an innovative approach with a learnable forward process for improved molecular generation in 3D while maintaining equivariance to Euclidean transformations.

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule

Conclusion: Boosting techniques with short training windows are effective for electricity DAM forecasting, with LightGBM being the most robust and accurate model.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical

We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,

Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize PCB schematics by automating component placement and demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing PCB designs manually is time-consuming, heavily reliant on skilled engineers, often neglected, and leads to higher costs, shorter product life cycles, and increased electronic waste.

Method: The paper utilizes bipartite graph representations of PCB schematics and applies a node-pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks to automate the addition of components.

Result: GNNs were tested on three PCB design optimization tasks using real-world datasets. Results showed high accuracy across multiple GNN architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively automates PCB design optimization, making the process more time- and cost-efficient and improving robustness and reliability.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves dynamic regret bounds for mixable losses in non-stationary online learning using an advanced approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic regret minimization for non-stationary online learning has mainly addressed convex functions, ignoring scenarios where losses have stronger curvature, such as squared or logistic loss.

Method: It uses an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates and leverages the mixability property, a generalization of exp-concavity, for analyzing loss curvature.

Result: Achieved a dynamic regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ for mixable losses, which improves over the previous best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ bound by reducing dimensionality dependence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only simplifies the regret analysis approach for mixable losses but also significantly improves performance bounds, presenting progress in non-stationary online learning dynamics.

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new approach to digitize paper-based ECG recordings, especially focusing on handling signal overlaps using a U-Net based segmentation pipeline and adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing ECG signals from paper-based recordings is often hindered by overlapping signals, rendering existing methods ineffective. The paper aims to address this gap for better signal isolation and accurate digitization.

Method: A two-stage pipeline is proposed: (1) A U-Net segmentation network isolates the primary ECG trace, trained with overlapping signal data and custom augmentations. (2) A digitization process converts the binary mask into time-series data using adaptive grid detection.

Result: The model achieves an IoU of 0.87 in segmentation tasks. In terms of digitization accuracy, for non-overlapping samples, it achieves MSE=0.0010 and rho=0.9644 (baseline MSE=0.0015, rho=0.9366). For overlapping samples, MSE=0.0029 and rho=0.9641 (baseline MSE=0.0178, rho=0.8676).

Conclusion: Their approach proves to be notably effective, especially in challenging overlapping scenarios, achieving superior digitization metrics over existing methods. This advancement strengthens the process of converting analog ECGs into digital formats for clinical and research purposes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph learning framework using low-rank factorization of conditional correlation matrix to improve scalability of graph learning in large dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address scalability issues in graph learning from node-gathered data, as conventional methods struggle with large-scale conditional correlation matrices.

Method: A low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix is used, alongside tools for Riemannian optimization. This framework is applied to a low-rank-constrained version of the GLasso algorithm.

Result: Synthetic and real data experiments show that the proposed approach achieves an efficient trade-off between dimensionality and performance.

Conclusion: The framework enhances scalability and performance for learning graphs with a low-rank conditional correlation matrix, making it valuable for processing large-scale data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

TL;DR: The paper discusses limitations of Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning and introduces new theoretical analyses focusing on skill diversity and separability, proposing novel metrics and algorithms to optimize downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current unsupervised reinforcement learning methods like MISL in initializing effective policies for unseen tasks, and to understand the role of skill diversity and separability in downstream task adaptation.

Method: The authors propose a disentanglement metric LSEPIN and develop a new objective function WSEP using Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence for optimizing skill learning. A further algorithm, PWSEP, is introduced for discovering all optimal initial policies.

Result: The proposed methods—WSEP and PWSEP—are shown to enable superior downstream task adaptation and discover optimal initial policies compared to MISL.

Conclusion: Skill diversity and separability are essential in downstream task adaptation. The paper's contributions—disentanglement metrics and Wasserstein-based algorithms—improve the theoretical soundness and practical outcomes of unsupervised reinforcement learning skill learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

### [263] [Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630)
*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-R1, a framework to enhance LLMs’ multi-step reasoning for time series forecasting, showing improved forecasting performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods overly rely on historical patterns and fast-thinking approaches, lacking multi-step reasoning. Slow-thinking LLMs show promise but face limitations such as computational cost and domain-specific reasoning challenges.

Method: The authors propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework involving supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a multi-objective reward system and GRIP for optimizing reasoning paths.

Result: Time-R1 enhances the generalization ability of LLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The study opens a new direction for time series forecasting by leveraging slow-thinking capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement fine-tuning, overcoming limitations of conventional prompt engineering.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to analyze the latent space of generative models, focusing on reconstructing the Fisher information metric, uncovering insights about their phase transitions and latent space structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing generative model latent spaces lack a comprehensive understanding of their geometric and thermodynamic properties, particularly with respect to phase transitions.

Method: The proposed method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables to reconstruct the Fisher information metric and learn the log-partition function, validated via the Ising, TASEP, and diffusion models.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities and reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in diffusion model latent spaces, including key insights on geodesic interpolations and phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of the geometric structure of generative model latent spaces and their connection to phase transitions, offering both theoretical and practical advancements.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of distribution shifts and data poisoning on the performance of models trained using Chain of Thought (CoT), focusing on the $k$-parity problem. It highlights unexpected drawbacks of CoT and provides a detailed explanation of its effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how real-world data shifts—distribution shifts and data poisoning—affect the reliability and efficacy of Chain of Thought reasoning outputs from large language models (LLMs), particularly in solving computationally difficult problems.

Method: The study rigorously investigates the $k$-parity problem, assessing the effects of distribution shifts and data poisoning on models trained using CoT decomposition. It contrasts CoT-based approaches with direct prediction methods to evaluate performance.

Result: CoT unexpectedly leads to worse performance compared to direct prediction in solving the $k$-parity problem under conditions of data shifts.

Conclusion: While Chain of Thought reasoning can enhance transformers' capabilities overall, this paper identifies significant vulnerabilities in its training approach when faced with data shifts, proposing mechanistic explanations for these limitations.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM) to improve continual learning by freezing well-trained neurons and reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural systems, especially Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), during sequential tasks.

Method: SatSOM employs a saturation mechanism that gradually decreases the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons to freeze trained areas and focus on underutilized parts.

Result: The saturation mechanism reduces forgetting and improves the knowledge retention capabilities of Self-Organizing Maps during continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: SatSOM successfully enhances SOMs by redirecting learning to less-utilized neurons, enabling better performance in sequential tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE is a new method that removes unwanted concepts from neural network embeddings while preserving target label correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle fairness and interpretability issues in neural networks by eliminating unwanted concepts while preserving useful correlations.

Method: SPLICE method uses an oblique projection to remove sensitive concepts while maintaining key label covariances with minimal distortion.

Result: SPLICE outperformed other methods in tasks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, successfully maintaining task-relevant information while removing unwanted attributes.

Conclusion: SPLICE offers a theoretically sound and empirically effective approach for balancing fairness and task performance in neural network embeddings.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

*Marco Spinaci,Marek Polewczyk,Maximilian Schambach,Sam Thelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConTextTab is introduced as a model combining semantic understanding and efficiency for tabular in-context learning, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular ICL architectures underutilize real-world data semantics, whereas pretrained language-based models have limited contextual capacity; there is a need for a model leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

Method: ConTextTab employs specialized embeddings for various data modalities and is trained on large-scale real-world tabular data to combine semantic understanding with table-native efficiency.

Result: The model shows competitive results across benchmarks and sets a new performance standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab bridges the gap between table-native architectural efficiency and semantic-rich capabilities of language-based models, making it highly effective for tabular ICL tasks.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Neural, a high-performing method for evidence-grounded clinical QA over EHRs, using prompt optimization and self-consistency voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precise and faithful clinical QA from EHRs under limited supervision.

Method: The task is decoupled into sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis, with prompt optimization using DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer and self-consistency voting.

Result: Neural achieved a score of 51.5, significantly outperforming zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods.

Conclusion: Optimized prompt-based methods can enhance clinical QA effectively, bypassing extensive model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FGN, a new machine learning based weather forecasting model that outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and ensemble prediction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent developments in ML-based weather forecasting have shown promise in outperforming traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods, necessitating more scalable and accurate solutions.

Method: The study proposes the FGN model, which generates ensembles using learned model perturbations and constrained models. It is trained with the continuous rank probability score (CRPS) to enhance forecasting accuracy.

Result: FGN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, demonstrates strong skill in tropical cyclone predictions, and effectively captures joint spatial patterns.

Conclusion: FGN is a simple yet powerful solution that advances ensemble-based weather forecasting, offering significant improvements in scalability, accuracy, and spatial modeling.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

### [271] [Monotone Classification with Relative Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10775)
*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the determination of a near-optimal monotone classifier in monotone classification while minimizing the cost defined as label revelation. It improves on prior work by achieving relative error bounds instead of absolute ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in previous methods that only achieve classifiers with errors higher than optimal by an absolute factor, and explore costs in constructing relative-error bounded monotone classifiers.

Method: The approach formulates the problem with parameters $\epsilon$ and $k^*$, establishes the relationship between error and label-revealing cost, and provides theoretical upper and lower bounds for solutions across varying $\epsilon$.

Result: The authors derive nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the cost required for producing monotone classifiers with relative error bounds for all values of $\epsilon \ge 0$.

Conclusion: The study introduces an effective framework with theoretical insights for label-efficient monotone classification with relative-error guarantees, superior to previous methods that are constrained to absolute-error bounds.

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

*Benjamin Hoover,Zhaoyang Shi,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Dmitry Krotov,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the log-sum-ReLU (LSR) energy function for Dense Associative Memory networks, achieving exponential capacity in memory retrieval and generating emergent local minima with creative properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Dense Associative Memory models typically use the log-sum-exponential function, which has limitations in memory retrieval and capacity.

Method: The paper introduces LSR energy, inspired by the Epanechnikov kernel, allowing exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and emergent local minima for creative task potential.

Result: Empirical tests show abundant local minima in LSR with high log-likelihood and novel emergent memory characteristics on image datasets.

Conclusion: LSR energy offers promising improvements for DenseAM networks in large-scale memory storage and creative generative tasks while maintaining perfect pattern recovery.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of activation probes to detect harmful "high-stakes" interactions in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance with significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve monitoring mechanisms for LLMs, targeting high-stakes interactions to ensure safety and prevent significant harm.

Method: The study uses synthetic datasets to train several probe architectures for monitoring interactions and evaluates their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution real-world scenarios.

Result: The probes effectively generalize to diverse datasets, perform comparably to larger LLM monitors, and deliver substantial computational savings.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that activation probes are a cost-effective and efficient first step in hierarchical monitoring systems for LLMs, with potential for broader practical applications.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically explores the vulnerabilities of Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) to efficiency-based adversarial attacks, proposing a taxonomy and discussing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As DDLSs increasingly facilitate real-time applications in resource-constrained environments, their adaptive mechanisms introduce vulnerabilities to efficiency adversarial attacks, threatening both performance and security.

Method: The paper categorizes efficiency attacks on DDLSs into three types based on dynamic behaviors, performs an in-depth evaluation of these attacks, and evaluates existing defense mechanisms to highlight their limitations.

Result: The study identifies key challenges in securing DDLSs from efficiency attacks and demonstrates the weaknesses of current defense strategies, emphasizing the need for novel solutions.

Conclusion: Achieving efficiency robustness in DDLSs is critical as current defenses are inadequate. Future research must develop adaptive strategies to mitigate efficiency adversarial attacks and enhance system security.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning framework for credit card fraud detection using real-world datasets, extracting behavioral and temporal features, and leveraging unsupervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased prevalence of digital payments necessitates scalable, intelligent solutions for detecting fraudulent transactions.

Method: The research involves merging multi-faceted datasets, extracting rich features, applying unsupervised ML models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and deep autoencoders, and using cluster analysis for anomaly detection.

Result: Unsupervised models detect outliers effectively using anomaly scores and PCA visualizations help illustrate anomaly separation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential for enhancing fraud detection by revealing latent patterns through comprehensive feature engineering and combining multiple unsupervised learning techniques.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization for robust state constraint satisfaction in reinforcement learning under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of achieving robust safety in reinforcement learning, particularly in the face of unknown disturbances.

Method: The authors analyze how entropy regularization biases learning towards preserving future viable actions and explore the use of penalty-based relaxation of constraints to approximate constrained RL problems as unconstrained ones.

Result: The findings show that entropy regularization inherently promotes constraint satisfaction, and by reformulating constraints through penalties, both safety and optimality can be preserved while improving disturbance resilience.

Conclusion: Connecting entropy regularization with robustness is a promising direction for enhancing robust safety in RL using simplified reward shaping techniques.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and capabilities of generating attacks on finite mixtures of classifiers, which enhance robustness against adversarial attacks but are inadequately targeted by existing attacking methods.

Method: The authors propose two properties for designing attacks (effectiveness and maximality) and introduce a novel attack strategy called "lattice climber attack," providing theoretical guarantees for binary linear classifiers and validating it via experiments.

Result: The new attack method, "lattice climber attack," outperforms existing approaches in terms of meeting the desired properties, verified through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The work highlights limitations in current adversarial attacks on finite mixtures of classifiers and offers a robust alternative with theoretical backing, further enhancing understanding of adversarial vulnerability.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Motivation: To address the weaker performance of uniform-state discrete diffusion models compared to autoregressive and masked diffusion models in text generation.

Method: The authors propose 'Duo,' leveraging techniques from Gaussian diffusion, including a Gaussian-guided curriculum learning strategy to reduce training variance and Discrete Consistency Distillation for faster sampling.

Result: The method speeds up training by 2x, achieves better zero-shot perplexity than autoregressive models on 3 of 7 benchmarks, and reduces sampling time by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The Duo method effectively narrows the performance gap for discrete diffusion models, making them competitive in terms of both speed and accuracy in text generation.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

### [279] [NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911)
*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoLoCo, a communication-efficient training method for large language models that eliminates global parameter synchronization, offering scalability on low-bandwidth networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale model training is constrained by high communication overhead and the need for synchronized clusters, which becomes impractical and costly, especially on low-bandwidth networks.

Method: NoLoCo employs a modified Nesterov momentum optimizer that partially averages model weights with a randomly selected counterpart, avoiding explicit global parameter synchronization.

Result: NoLoCo demonstrated significantly reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods like DiLoCo, with faster synchronization and up to 4% faster convergence across different model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: NoLoCo is an effective optimization alternative for scaling large language models without reliance on high-bandwidth infrastructure, improving training efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Emil Javurek,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalFM introduces a novel framework for training tabular foundation models for causal inference using structured Bayesian priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve causal inference techniques in fields like medicine and economics by leveraging modern pre-trained PFNs and specifically constructing Bayesian priors.

Method: The study formalizes Bayesian priors based on structural causal models (SCMs) and proposes causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks to train PFNs for various causal inference settings.

Result: CausalFM demonstrates competitive performance in estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalFM provides a general framework that may redefine causal inference approaches and applications across multiple domains.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), which unify and generalize several neural sequence models for fast parallel training and efficient sequential inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent neural sequence models aim for fast training and inference but lack a unified framework capturing their efficiency and expressivity.

Method: The paper introduces Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), a generalization of state space models, leveraging aggregation operators (possibly non-associative) for efficient computation.

Result: PSMs retain transformer-like expressivity, match state space model inference efficiency, and demonstrate strong length generalization.

Conclusion: PSMs provide a versatile foundation for sequence modeling, combining computational efficiency with improved generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anti-bias prompts fail to mitigate demographic biases in large language models (LLMs) during hiring scenarios involving realistic context, but internal bias mitigation techniques reduce biases significantly while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address bias issues in LLMs deployed in hiring scenarios where decisions affect individuals' careers and livelihoods.

Method: The internal bias mitigation technique neutralizes race and gender-correlated directions in model activations using affine concept editing during inference.

Result: Biases induced by realistic contextual details were reduced to under 1% (always below 2.5%) across tested commercial and open-source models, while performance was largely unaffected.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt realistic evaluation methods and internal bias mitigation techniques to ensure equitable outcomes when deploying LLMs in hiring applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL introduces a method for large language models (LLMs) to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and optimization directives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but lack mechanisms for dynamic adaptation to new tasks, knowledge, or examples.

Method: SEAL utilizes a self-edit framework where the model generates finetuning data, optimization parameters, and performs reinforced adjustments to its own weights.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SEAL's effectiveness in knowledge incorporation and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: SEAL is a significant step toward enabling LLMs to perform self-directed adaptation, enhancing their utility in dynamic applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

### [285] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUARD, a framework to address the challenge of unintended forgetting in LLM unlearning. GUARD uses data attribution metrics to balance forgetting specific data while preserving desired information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in LLMs faces challenges such as unintended forgetting, which compromises the model's utility and retention of critical information. This paper seeks to address this issue that arises when removing high-impact data.

Method: GUARD employs a lightweight proxy data attribution metric to quantify alignment between forget and retain sets and introduces adaptive unlearning weights based on these metrics, minimizing unintended retention losses.

Result: Experiments on the TOFU benchmark show GUARD improves utility preservation significantly, reducing utility sacrifice by up to 194.92% on the Retain Set when forgetting 10% of training data.

Conclusion: GUARD effectively enhances retention, retains desired information, and ensures unlearning performance remains comparable to prior methods, addressing critical challenges in LLM data compliance and privacy.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EG-CFG, a novel neural code generation method that uses real-time execution signals for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack execution feedback during inference, a limitation compared to how human programmers approach code generation.

Method: EG-CFG integrates execution signals during code generation by employing beam search to generate candidates, testing them, and using feedback iteratively.

Result: EG-CFG achieves state-of-the-art performance in code generation across tasks of varying complexity.

Conclusion: Execution-guided feedback in neural code generation can significantly enhance code generation capabilities and outcomes.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing human-designed web interfaces with Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) optimized for autonomous web agents, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to web agents struggle with mismatches between LLM capabilities and human-oriented web interfaces, such as complex DOM trees and reliance on screenshots or APIs.

Method: The paper introduces Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) and six guiding principles to design interfaces tailored for AI agent navigation, focusing on safety, efficiency, and standardization.

Result: The concept of AWIs shifts the research direction to designing agent-specific web interfaces rather than adapting LLMs to existing human-centric designs.

Conclusion: AWIs provide a pathway for overcoming limitations in web agent designs, requiring collaboration across the ML community to ensure safe, efficient, and transparent implementation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance improves diffusion model-based inverse problem-solving by refining sample realism and improving reward quality through a method combining reverse ODE and DPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boost sample quality and reward in solving challenging inverse problems with pretrained diffusion models, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.

Method: ReGuidance employs a two-step approach: solving the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse to refine a candidate solution, and using the result as input to diffusion posterior sampling (DPS).

Result: ReGuidance significantly improves sample quality and measurement consistency in tasks like large box in-painting and high upscaling super-resolution, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ReGuidance successfully enhances both realism and reward, while providing the first theoretical guarantee for improvement under certain data distributions in DPS.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical aspects of in-context learning (ICL) for regression of H"older functions on manifolds, connecting attention mechanisms to kernel methods and analyzing error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of ICL in language and vision applications, its theoretical understanding, especially related to structured geometric data, remains largely unexplored.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of transformers by deriving error bounds that depend on prompt length, number of tasks, and manifold dimensions, connecting these to kernel methods.

Result: Transformers achieve minimax regression rates tied to the intrinsic manifold dimension and offer scalable bounds with increased training tasks.

Conclusion: Findings illuminate how geometry influences ICL, providing theoretical tools to understand transformers as in-context learners for nonlinear geometric data.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TL;DR: Farseer introduces a new scaling law that better predicts large language model (LLM) performance across scales by reducing extrapolation error significantly compared to older methods, like Chinchilla's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training is expensive, and insights from small-scale experiments often fail to accurately predict the behavior of large-scale models. The paper aims to create a more reliable predictive framework to bridge this scaling gap.

Method: Farseer systematically constructs a model loss surface L(N,D), allowing it to fit empirical data more effectively. An extensive set of approximately 1,000 LLMs was trained to validate this methodology, consuming about 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours.

Result: Farseer demonstrates superior extrapolation capabilities, reducing extrapolation error by 433% compared to Chinchilla's law. It facilitates reliable evaluation of training strategies across all scales while also optimizing compute allocation.

Conclusion: Farseer can reliably generalize small-scale experimental conclusions to large-scale setups, enhancing both predictive accuracy and optimization of resources in modern LLM training. Open-sourcing the data fosters further research in the field.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for transforming traditional neural network architectures into neural operators that can learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling applications in scientific problems like PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional neural networks in handling infinite-dimensional function spaces and offer a methodology to apply deep learning to scientific applications.

Method: The authors provide key principles to convert existing neural network architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications, extending their utility to manage mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces.

Result: The paper demonstrates how several popular neural architectures can be adapted into neural operators, unlocking their potential for scientific computing and PDEs modeling.

Conclusion: Neural operators, derived from neural networks, can effectively bridge gaps in scientific applications and function spaces, offering enhanced practicality and optimization in these domains.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

### [293] [A Language-Agnostic Logical Relation for Message-Passing Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10026)
*Tesla Zhang,Sonya Simkin,Rui Li,Yue Yao,Stephanie Balzer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for verifying protocol compliance in distributed, heterogeneous message-passing systems using a language-agnostic logical relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to verify protocol adherence in distributed and heterogeneous systems, particularly those leveraging message-passing and involving foreign objects, which cannot rely on common language implementations or type systems.

Method: Introduced a framework based on a language-agnostic logical relation, utilizing a labelled transition-based semantics. Mechanized the framework in Coq and examined two use cases: one for specific applications/devices and one for type-system-based verification.

Result: Successfully implemented the framework in Coq to certify protocol compliance in the proposed scenarios, even for untyped components or foreign objects.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the viability of verifying protocol compliance in heterogeneous systems using a scalable and flexible logical-relation-based framework.

Abstract: Today's computing landscape has been gradually shifting to applications
targeting distributed and *heterogeneous* systems, such as cloud computing and
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are predominantly
*concurrent*, employ *message-passing*, and interface with *foreign objects*,
ranging from externally implemented code to actual physical devices such as
sensors. Verifying that the resulting systems adhere to the intended protocol
of interaction is challenging -- the usual assumption of a common
implementation language, let alone a type system, no longer applies, ruling out
any verification method based on them. This paper develops a framework for
certifying *protocol compliance* of heterogeneous message-passing systems. It
contributes the first mechanization of a *language-agnostic logical relation*,
asserting that its inhabitants comply with the protocol specified. This
definition relies entirely on a labelled transition-based semantics,
accommodating arbitrary inhabitants, typed and untyped alike, including foreign
objects. As a case study, the paper considers two scenarios: (1) *per-instance
verification* of a specific application or hardware device, and (2)
*once-and-for-all verification* of well-typed applications for a given type
system. The logical relation and both scenarios are mechanized in the Coq
theorem prover.

*Zhiyao Zhong,Cyrus Omar*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Hazel Deriver is a web-based tool aiding students in constructing rule-based derivation trees, focusing on real-time feedback and reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often face difficulties in making derivation trees due to challenges like inference rule application, lack of feedback, and tedious manual processes.

Method: The paper introduces Hazel Deriver, leveraging the Hazel live programming environment to provide interactive, layered scaffolding and real-time feedback to users.

Result: A user study indicates Hazel Deriver makes derivation tasks easier, enhances understanding, and promotes higher engagement.

Conclusion: Hazel Deriver is promising for improving student experience in derivation tasks, but future work should address autonomy versus guidance balance.

Abstract: Students in programming languages and formal logic courses often struggle
with constructing rule-based derivation trees due to the complexity of applying
inference rules, the lack of immediate feedback, and the manual effort required
for handwritten proofs. We present Hazel Deriver, a live, web-based editor
designed to scaffold derivation construction through multiple layers of
support. Built on the Hazel live programming environment, it provides a
structured, interactive experience that encourages iterative exploration and
real-time feedback. A preliminary user study with former students suggests that
Hazel Deriver reduces the perceived difficulty of derivation tasks while
improving conceptual understanding and engagement. We discuss the design of its
layered scaffolding features and raise questions about balancing system
guidance with learner autonomy.

*Ashley Samuelson,Andrew K. Hirsch,Ethan Cecchetti*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new choreographic language, $
\lambda_{QC}$, which includes advanced features for concurrent programming, such as polymorphism and dynamic computation of process names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern concurrent systems need dynamic and flexible capabilities, such as computed process assignments, which existing choreographic programming languages lack.

Method: The authors present $
\lambda_{QC}$, a choreographic language with typed features like first-class process names, polymorphism, recursive data structures, and multiply-located values, verified using Rocq.

Result: The results demonstrate improved expressiveness and capabilities for concurrency programming while maintaining deadlock freedom.

Conclusion: $
\lambda_{QC}$ advances the field of choreographic programming by addressing limitations of previous languages and offering robust features for dynamic system programming.

Abstract: Choreographic programming is a promising new paradigm for programming
concurrent systems where a developer writes a single centralized program that
compiles to individual programs for each node. Existing choreographic
languages, however, lack critical features integral to modern systems, like the
ability of one node to dynamically compute who should perform a computation and
send that decision to others. This work addresses this gap with $\lambda_{QC}$,
the first typed choreographic language with \emph{first class process names}
and polymorphism over both types and (sets of) locations. $\lambda_{QC}$ also
improves expressive power over previous work by supporting algebraic and
recursive data types as well as multiply-located values. We formalize and
mechanically verify our results in Rocq, including the standard choreographic
guarantee of deadlock freedom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of adapting robotic systems for diverse missions in precision agriculture, especially for users lacking technical expertise.

Method: The system uses large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to interpret natural language task instructions. It employs IEEE task standards for mission planning and ROS2 nodes to operationalize tasks on robots, bridging high-level planning with available robotics libraries.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal both strengths and limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning and routing. The system offers a solution to overcome these limitations, ensuring effective robotic task execution in precision agriculture.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs like ChatGPT with standardized task specifications and ROS2 can enable effective, user-friendly robotic operations for non-expert users, with potential to enhance precision agriculture.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian Mixture Copula Models for modeling driving scenarios, outperforming prior methods in terms of data fit metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve statistical modeling of driving scenarios, enabling better safety validation for automated driving systems through effective risk quantification.

Method: The study uses Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to separately model marginal distributions and dependencies, benchmarking against Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models with real-world driving data.

Result: Results show Gaussian Mixture Copula Models exhibit superior fit to data, outperforming previous methods in likelihood and Sinkhorn distance across 18 million scenarios.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models hold significant promise for establishing robust scenario-based safety validation frameworks for automated driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a natural language robotic mission planner using large language models, enabling non-technical agricultural users to control diverse robots via a common interface without coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that non-technical farmers face when adopting complex robotic technologies in precision agriculture.

Method: The system uses large language models and predefined primitives to convert natural language instructions into intermediate descriptions executable by various robotic platforms.

Result: The architecture successfully supports a range of robots and handles complex mission requests, including robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: This system simplifies robotics-based automation in precision agriculture, making it more accessible to users without technical backgrounds.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

### [299] [A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172)
*Yicheng Duan,Kaiyu tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular navigation framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation using frozen VL models combined with lightweight planning strategies, aiming to improve adaptability and efficiency without extensive model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenges of VLN, which requires interpreting natural language and navigating unfamiliar environments, compounded by computational demands of existing large VL models.

Method: A modular framework integrates a frozen large vision-language model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) with techniques like prompt engineering and structured history management for navigation.

Result: Evaluations on the Room-to-Room benchmark show difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments under strict settings but suggest scalability potential.

Conclusion: The modular approach opens avenues for efficient and scalable navigation systems, with room for future enhancements from environmental priors and multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

### [300] [A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Dynamic-, Trajectory- and Vision-based Virtual Fixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10239)
*Maximilian Mühlbauer,Freek Stulp,Sylvain Calinon,Alin Albu-Schäffer,João Silvério*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) to balance human involvement and robot automation in task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance task precision and productivity by enabling adaptive haptic feedback and balancing human involvement with robot automation.

Method: The framework utilizes probabilistic Dynamical System-based VFs for coarse guidance, probabilistic trajectory-based fixtures for precise tasks, and extends visual servoing fixtures for manual tasks.

Result: Experimental validation on various robots showed effective task management with multiple operation modes and simplified fixture programming.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates adaptive task phase automation while retaining human interaction and achieves geometry-aware and impedance-optimized behavior in virtual fixtures.

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

### [301] [Innovative Adaptive Imaged Based Visual Servoing Control of 6 DoFs Industrial Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10240)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive control algorithm for image-based visual servoing (IBVS) using Youla Parameterization. It handles scenarios where features are outside or inside the field of view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IBVS methods struggle with controlling robotic systems when 3D point features lie outside the field of view. There is a need to design a robust solution for pose alignment in such scenarios.

Method: The paper develops a feedforward-feedback adaptive control structure using Youla Parameterization, along with an adaptive camera and robot manipulator model. This involves stable feature estimation and linearization-adaptive algorithms.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed solution maintains effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios, even when features initially lie outside the field of view.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive control algorithm enhances IBVS by ensuring precision, stability, and easy implementation in industrial settings, addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

### [302] [A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the camera pose estimation and navigation challenges in robotics by formulating the problem as Perspective-3-Point (P3P) and proposing a control strategy to enhance system stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate camera pose determination is critical for robot navigation and manipulation tasks, but misalignment of degrees of freedom and constraints can introduce local minimum issues during servoing.

Method: The paper proposes a novel control strategy integrating a feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller for positioning a calibrated stereo camera.

Result: Simulations show the proposed method improves robustness, avoids local minima, and accurately aligns the stereo camera to the desired pose.

Conclusion: The proposed control strategy successfully ensures effective and accurate servoing for stereo cameras, addressing common stability issues in image-based visual servoing scenarios.

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

*Alexandre Capone,Ryan Cosner,Aaaron Ames,Sandra Hirche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure control task safety amidst high model uncertainty without needing a backup controller, using data-driven exploration with a control barrier function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring system safety during control tasks despite high levels of uncertainty in learned models.

Method: Combining a control barrier function with a learned model for robust safety certification, and using a Gaussian process bandit algorithm to explore and collect data when constraints are infeasible.

Result: The proposed approach achieves provable system safety even with a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without relying on a backup controller.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel framework for safe learning-based control under high uncertainty, combining exploration and safety filters.

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale Bayesian optimization method to address challenges in controlling nuclear fusion systems, significantly improving success rates in live experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulties of controlling complex, real-world systems like nuclear fusion where traditional machine learning techniques fall short.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale Bayesian optimization approach combining a high-frequency data-driven dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process, validated on historical and live DIII-D nuclear fusion experiments.

Result: The method achieves a 50% success rate in live nuclear fusion experiments, representing a 117% improvement over historical outcomes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses nuclear fusion control challenges by rapidly adapting to new data, significantly enhancing performance in both offline and live settings.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper enhances lane-topology prediction by incorporating structured road metadata and lane-width priors into a pre-existing model, improving detection and association in intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lane-topology prediction is essential for autonomous navigation, and the authors aim to improve predictions using conventions encoded in natural language through road metadata.

Method: The researchers augment an existing lane-topology model, SMERF, with structured data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) maps and lane-width priors from design manuals, combining this information with road centerline encodings.

Result: The approach shows improved detection and association of lanes and traffic elements, succeeding in complex and diverse intersection scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method generalizes well across different topologies while demonstrating scalability and improved performance.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper examines data-driven improvements in robotic multi-suction picking in cluttered environments using multimodal visual encoders for candidate pick prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve robotic picking systems for handling diverse items in unstructured, real-world environments such as warehouses.

Method: Utilizes multimodal inputs (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation) and employs a combination of multimodal pretraining and finetuning using real-world picking data.

Result: Demonstrates improved prediction of pick success across diverse datasets and scenarios, with analysis of mode-specific training and pretraining benefits.

Conclusion: Using multiple input modalities enhances robotic pick quality estimation, with models learning inter-modal relationships for streamlined inputs during inference.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

*Daniel Betschinske,Malte Schrimpf,Steven Peters,Kamil Klonecki,Jan Peter Karch,Moritz Lippert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and identifies methods to improve field testing for ADAS and ADS safety validation, addressing inefficiencies and challenges posed by traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADAS and ADS safety validation demands better efficiency and reliability in quantifying residual risk, especially under stringent international standards such as ISO 21448.

Method: The paper systematically identifies Reduction Approaches (RAs), derives models based on ISO 21448 for safety validation, and evaluates each RA on criteria like quantifiability, validity threats, missing links, and black-box compatibility.

Result: The analysis revealed benefits and limitations across current approaches, highlighting that no approach fully eliminates the need for Field Operational Testing (FOT).

Conclusion: While alternatives to FOT show promise, FOT remains indispensable for safety validation, requiring further research into improving Reduction Approaches (RAs).

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

*Nidhi Homey Parayil,Thierry Peynot,Chris Lehnert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel robotic navigation controller using tactile feedback for navigating dense, deformable environments, achieving robustness and safety in agricultural canopies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic navigation within cluttered environments like agricultural canopies, where traditional approaches fail due to occlusion and fragile foliage.

Method: Developed a reactive controller using end-effector positioning and real-time tactile feedback, balancing obstacle avoidance and necessary physical interaction to navigate toward targets without damage.

Result: In 35 experimental trials across three plant setups, the proposed controller reached the target in all instances without damaging branches and outperformed state-of-the-art model-free controllers.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for safe and adaptive robotic interaction in cluttered and deformable environments, with potential applications in agriculture for tasks such as pruning and harvesting.

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how group-adaptive conversational designs can improve interactions between socially interactive agents (SIAs) and human groups.

Method: Conducted two real-world studies with SIAs (a social robot and a virtual agent) using conversational AI in a German museum, involving 188 participants in different group settings.

Result: No significant effect of group-sensitive design on perceived satisfaction, but the study provided valuable insights on multi-party interaction challenges and differences among embodiments.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need for multimodal strategies for adapting conversational AI in group settings, contributing to the fields of HAI, HRI, and HMI.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance computational efficiency in robotic arm control, particularly for calculating joint torques/forces and their derivatives through compact yet efficient formulations.

Method: The proposed method introduces a Lie group formulation using spatial representations, complemented by a second-order inverse dynamics and fourth-order kinematics algorithms.

Result: The algorithm was applied to the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot, showcasing its effectiveness and computational benefits.

Conclusion: Lie group formulations offer an efficient way of robotic arm control by utilizing readily available vectorial representations, achieving compact and efficient algorithmic designs.

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

*Yuhang Zhang,Haosheng Yu,Jiaping Xiao,Mir Feroskhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLFly is introduced as a UAV-focused system for performing vision-and-language navigation based solely on monocular camera observations, addressing generalization to unseen environments and continuous action space challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome two primary issues in vision-and-language navigation: poor generalization in unseen environments and the limitations of fixed discrete action spaces. They focus on enabling UAVs for autonomous, language-guided navigation without reliance on localization or ranging sensors.

Method: VLFly consists of three modules: (1) an instruction encoder leveraging a large language model for processing language inputs as structured prompts, (2) a vision-language model-based goal retriever to match prompts to goal images, and (3) a waypoint planner that formulates continuous trajectories for UAV navigation.

Result: VLFly demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines across diverse simulation environments without further fine-tuning. Real-world experiments validate its robustness and capability to handle abstract language inputs in various indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: This study highlights VLFly as a generalizable and robust framework for UAV navigation using vision-and-language models, operating effectively in real-world and simulation setups without additional localization hardware.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

*Felix Nonnengießer,Alap Kshirsagar,Boris Belousov,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining visual and tactile data for robotic in-hand object pose estimation, achieving high accuracy even under visual occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-based approaches for robotic in-hand pose estimation struggle with visual occlusion, making accurate object manipulation difficult.

Method: The method fuses point clouds from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and vision-based tactile sensors using a weighted sensor fusion module and an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.

Result: The approach significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, achieving a 7.5 mm and 16.7° error on average, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Incorporating tactile information resolves occlusion challenges, enhances pose estimation accuracy, and enables precise real-world object manipulation.

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAMA, a benchmark for language-conditioned manipulation, and proposes the RationalVLA model, which excels in reasoning and rejecting faulty instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-world robotic deployments by addressing challenges of understanding and responding to ambiguous or infeasible natural language instructions.

Method: Developed a RAMA benchmark with 14,000+ samples, covering six types of defective instructions, and proposed a Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA) with learnable latent space embeddings for robust task reasoning and execution.

Result: RationalVLA achieved a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length improvement on RAMA compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive standard task performance. Real-world trials confirmed its robustness.

Conclusion: RationalVLA demonstrates enhanced reliability in language-conditioned robotic tasks by effectively reasoning over ambiguous and defective instructions, setting a new standard for robust robotic manipulation.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

### [315] [Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Autonomous Surface Vessels with Partial Orientation Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10850)
*Derek Benham,Easton Potokar,Joshua G. Mangelson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework optimized for autonomous surface vessel (ASV) state estimation using partial orientation measurements derived from horizon-based roll/pitch observations and GPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for precise state estimation in autonomous surface vessels, especially regarding vehicle pose for accurate underwater mapping, due to the significant consequences of subtle surface deviations in open ocean environments where fixed landmark-based techniques are not feasible.

Method: The authors developed a novel InEKF framework that utilizes horizon-based roll and pitch measurements (from monocular cameras) alongside GPS heading data to estimate ASV pose, avoiding reliance on full orientation measurements or fixed landmarks.

Result: The proposed partial orientation InEKF was compared to full orientation InEKF and Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Results showcase its superior accuracy and robustness in ASV state estimation, particularly in open ocean environments.

Conclusion: The partial orientation InEKF framework effectively addresses challenges in open ocean ASV state estimation, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods and facilitating precise mapping for marine science applications.

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven modeling approach reduces computational time and predicts robot interactions with granular terrains effectively by integrating dimension reduction, surrogate modeling, and data assimilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robot navigation in complex terrains by developing a faster and accurate modeling method compared to traditional high-fidelity simulations.

Method: The approach integrates sequentially truncated higher-order singular value decomposition (dimension reduction), Gaussian Process (surrogate modeling), and reduced-order particle filter (data assimilation) on offline data (simulation and sparse experimental).

Result: The new approach significantly reduces computation time, maintains accuracy comparable to simulations, and excels in long-horizon predictions when physical data is incorporated.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively supports robot navigation in unknown terrains and demonstrates general predictability, making it valuable for both online and offline applications.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

*Dong Hae Mangalindan,Karthik Kandikonda,Ericka Rovira,Vaibhav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how robot performance and trust repair strategies affect human trust in a robot-assisted delivery task, using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to model trust dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With autonomous systems becoming more efficient and reliable, understanding their impact on human trust is critical to enhancing human-robot collaboration in tasks like robot-assisted delivery.

Method: The authors used human participant data to model trust dynamics via an IOHMM. They experimented with strategies such as explanations (short/long), apologies, promises, and denials to observe their trust-repair effectiveness.

Result: Long explanations were found to be the most effective for repairing trust after failures, while denial was best at preventing trust loss. High trust levels also increased the likelihood of humans allowing robots to act autonomously.

Conclusion: The proposed trust model is interpretable and aligns with self-reported trust values, paving the way for optimizing real-time trust adjustment in autonomous systems.

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving high-precision manipulation of objects held in hand, especially for planar objects.

Method: It integrates a vibration-based actuator to control effective friction, a model of sliding motion for clamped objects, and a motion planner to coordinate trajectories and vibrations.

Result: Vib2Move achieved final positioning errors consistently below 6 mm across various planar objects in real-world trials.

Conclusion: The Vib2Move framework demonstrates reliable and precise manipulation, showcasing innovations in vibration and friction-based object reconfiguration.

Abstract: We introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-hand object reconfiguration
that uses fingertip micro-vibrations and gravity to precisely reposition planar
objects. Our framework comprises three key innovations. First, we design a
vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object
friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second,
we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenManip, a simulation platform and benchmark (GenManip-Bench) aimed at evaluating policy generalization for robotic manipulation in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulation platforms struggle with supporting robust generalization in real-world robotic manipulation, particularly with adaptability to instructions and varied scenarios.

Method: The authors developed GenManip, which uses an LLM-driven automatic pipeline to generate diverse tasks from 3D object assets alongside a benchmark, GenManip-Bench, containing 200 scenarios refined by human corrections.

Result: Evaluation reveals that modular manipulation systems, integrated with foundation models for perception and reasoning, show superior generalization than end-to-end policies despite the latter benefiting from data scaling.

Conclusion: GenManip is expected to advance studies on robotic policy generalization in realistic contexts by providing critical insights and resources for researchers.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EyeRobot, a robotic system equipped with an active gaze mechanism for task-oriented behavior using a mechanical eyeball and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans actively look to interact with their surroundings, inspiring the development of a robotic system that mimics this functionality for improved task performance.

Method: The study develops a mechanical eyeball paired with a gaze policy driven by reinforcement learning. It uses teleoperated demonstrations with a 360 camera, creates a simulation environment for eye gaze rollouts on robot demonstrations, and employs a BC-RL loop to train coordinated eye and hand action.

Result: EyeRobot demonstrates improved hand-eye coordination for panoramic workspace manipulation tasks, showing stable fixation, better object tracking, and robust distraction handling within a limited compute budget.

Conclusion: EyeRobot's active gaze mechanism enhances robotic manipulation capabilities in large workspaces, with hand-eye coordination emerging naturally from the system's architecture and training approach.

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TrioXpert is an end-to-end framework that uses multimodal data and large language models to enhance automated incident management in microservice systems, achieving significant improvements in anomaly detection, failure triage, and root cause localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incident management methods often rely on single-modal data and struggle with multiple downstream tasks while lacking interpretability. This research aims to overcome these challenges to improve performance and reasoning clarity.

Method: TrioXpert incorporates three independent pipelines tailored to various data modalities and employs large language models for collaborative reasoning to handle multiple tasks and provide interpretability.

Result: TrioXpert significantly enhances performance in incident management tasks, improving anomaly detection by up to 57.7%, failure triage by up to 40.6%, and root cause localization by up to 163.1% on microservice datasets.

Conclusion: This framework proves robust in addressing incident management challenges with multimodal data and offers a promising solution for comprehensive and interpretable performance improvements in microservice environments.

Abstract: Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale
microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on
single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to
simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection
(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the
lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to
insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully
leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing
pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,
comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems
from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative
reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle
multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong
interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular
microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that
TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),
FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing process simulation techniques fail to adapt to real-time changes in dynamic business environments.

Method: A combination of Incremental Process Discovery and Online Machine Learning focusing on recent data while retaining historical information.

Result: Experiments on four event logs show the method improves simulation stability and robustness against concept drift.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enhances adaptive simulation modeling, making it suitable for dynamic processes.

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate
the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed
to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs,
reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic
business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing
techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time
operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation
discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online
Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while
preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process
dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the
importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining
historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations
but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one
of the use cases.

Motivation: To explore how generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot affect the performance, behavior, and understanding of students working on unfamiliar legacy codebases.

Method: Conducted a controlled experiment with 10 undergraduate students, analyzing their performance with and without Copilot through quantitative metrics and exit interviews.

Result: Students completed tasks 35% faster, made 50% more progress, wrote code 11% less manually, and conducted 12% fewer web searches using Copilot.

Conclusion: While Copilot significantly enhances efficiency, it raises concerns about students' understanding of why AI-generated solutions work, necessitating educational strategies emphasizing both usage benefits and reflection.

Abstract: When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they
will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people
other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development
settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like
GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the
impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks
remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences
undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding
when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an
unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10
undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield
development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a
mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and
exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)
and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,
our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time
manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p
< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in
programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not
understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the
need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that
leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why
GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using containerized Virtual Platforms for accelerated hardware/software co-development through cloud deployment and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in hardware availability and testing dependencies in early-stage software development, especially for safety-critical applications like automotive systems.

Method: The paper employs containerization to encapsulate Virtual Platforms based on open-source technologies such as QEMU and VCML, enabling cloud-based testing and parallel execution.

Result: They demonstrate the approach through a case study on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator Virtual Platform, showcasing its practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach addresses HW/SW system complexity and accelerates development, offering insights and solutions for testing in constrained environments.

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of HW/SW systems presents a persistent
challenge, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive, where
extensive testing is imperative. However, the availability of hardware often
lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,
Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a
pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified
target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging
containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies
and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as
open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat
licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a
robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW
systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.

### [325] [Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056)
*Gabriel Orlanski,Nicholas Roberts,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between the speed and accuracy of program verification approaches in large language models (LLMs), advocating for the use of outcome reward models (ORMs) to speed up verification while maintaining acceptable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that comprehensive verifiers should always be prioritized, and systematically investigate the trade-offs between accuracy and speed in program verification.

Method: Develop and analyze a 'generate-prune-then-rank' approach where a faster, less accurate verifier prunes incorrect solutions prior to ranking.

Result: The approach achieves 11.65x speed-up with only 8.33% decrease in accuracy compared to a full test suite, effectively filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions.

Conclusion: Outcome reward models (ORMs) facilitate scalable and efficient program ranking systems, providing a balance between speed and accuracy even when comprehensive verification methods are available.

Abstract: The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models
(LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier
in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier
(e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model
(ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs
involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in
scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a
comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent
when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less
accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a
system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full
test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it
works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings
enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.

*Andrei Paleyes,Radzim Sendyka,Diana Robinson,Christian Cabrera,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, focusing on sensitivity to user prompts and background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the dependency of code quality generated by LLMs on varied user prompts, backgrounds, and familiarity with development.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) A synthetic evaluation pipeline for systematic analysis and (2) Persona-based evaluation to assess how user background influences LLM code generation.

Result: The methods are shown to be independent of specific tasks or LLMs, making them broadly applicable, with evidence supporting their utility provided.

Conclusion: These evaluation methods help understand LLM variability in code output, and the accompanying code is made available for community use.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HyperRes is a system that resolves cross-package manager and cross-ecosystem dependency issues through hypergraphs, enabling interoperability without users needing to switch from their current package managers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing package managers lack interoperability, making it difficult to handle dependencies in multi-language projects and external system dependencies, which are often implicit and unversioned.

Method: The authors devised HyperRes, a system that utilizes hypergraphs to formally define versioned dependency resolution. They translated metadata from dozens of package managers into HyperRes and modeled dependency constraints across ecosystems.

Result: They demonstrated that dependency resolution is possible across otherwise distinct ecosystems through translation and hypergraph modeling.

Conclusion: HyperRes provides cross-ecosystem dependency resolution, eliminates the need for users to change their package managers, and customizes the resolution process to specific environments.

Abstract: Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating
system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between
these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise
dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware
dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a
formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph
that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency
constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package
managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution
can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require
users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for
the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be
precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.

Method: The study conducts a systematic review of SVD research, categorizes methods into taxonomies, and identifies trends, limitations, and opportunities.

Result: 91% of reviewed studies utilize AI-based models, with a dominance of graph-based methods, while gaps like dataset issues and low interpretability persist.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with suggestions for advancing underexplored methods like federated learning and quantum neural networks to improve SVD.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities in source code pose serious cybersecurity risks,
prompting a shift from traditional detection methods (e.g., static analysis,
rule-based matching) to AI-driven approaches. This study presents a systematic
review of software vulnerability detection (SVD) research from 2018 to 2023,
offering a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques, feature representations, and
embedding methods. Our analysis reveals that 91% of studies use AI-based
methods, with graph-based models being the most prevalent. We identify key
limitations, including dataset quality, reproducibility, and interpretability,
and highlight emerging opportunities in underexplored techniques such as
federated learning and quantum neural networks, providing a roadmap for future
research.

*Xueying Du,Kai Yu,Chong Wang,Yi Zou,Wentai Deng,Zuoyu Ou,Xin Peng,Lingming Zhang,Yiling Lou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4PFA, a framework that reduces false positives in static bug detection using LLM-based iterative path feasibility analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bug analyzers have high false positive rates due to limited handling of path feasibility with complex conditions and dependencies.

Method: An iterative path feasibility analysis framework called LLM4PFA, leveraging LLM agents for constraint reasoning and context-aware analysis.

Result: LLM4PFA reduces false positives by 72%-96% and outperforms baselines by up to 105.7%, missing only 3 real bugs out of 45 true positives.

Conclusion: LLM4PFA improves static bug detection by effectively addressing path feasibility analysis challenges, ensuring superior precision.

Abstract: Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality.
However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer
from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited
capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple
conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based
approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited
due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in
large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path
feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted
constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning,
LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis
for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show
that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during
static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% -
105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true
positives.

*Seyed Moein Abtahi,Akramul Azim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLMs like GPT for automated code issue detection, correction, and revision in software development workflows, leveraging tools like static code analysis and retrieval-augmented generation for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in code issue detection and correction, aiming to improve software development workflows and enhance code quality through automation.

Method: The authors combined static code analysis, iterative prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a custom-designed 'Code Comparison App' to ensure precise code issue detection and automated correction using LLMs.

Result: Using the proposed framework, significant reductions in software code issues were observed after implementation, validating the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with static code analysis and RAG proves effective in improving code quality, simplifying workflows, and reducing resource usage in software development.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

TL;DR: AutoGEEval++ is an advanced framework for evaluating geospatial code generation by large language models (LLMs) in Google Earth Engine, offering standardized metrics and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized, automated evaluation tools for geospatial code generation, particularly on Google Earth Engine.

Method: AutoGEEval++ employs a benchmark dataset, submission program, and judge module to automate code generation evaluation using multi-dimensional metrics such as accuracy, resource usage, runtime efficiency, and error analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs revealed differences in performance, stability, and error patterns across tasks and deployment settings, demonstrating the framework's utility in assessing domain-specific code generation.

Conclusion: AutoGEEval++ establishes the first unified evaluation protocol and benchmark for geospatial code generation in Google Earth Engine, enabling systematic and scalable comparisons among LLMs.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating
artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised
automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents
AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first
automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating
geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data
modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API,
AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test
cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme
tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an
end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to
execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional
metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error
types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary
testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24
state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose,
reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results
reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types,
model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical
value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes
the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for
GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance
comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code
evaluation.

### [332] [MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376)
*Fan Wu,Cuiyun Gao,Shuqing Li,Xin-Cheng Wen,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LayoutCoder, a novel framework for converting website UI images into code using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing limitations of existing methods that require heavy data labeling and struggle with layout precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to automate the generation of website UI code from images to reduce the time and effort in website development and to address the limitations of current deep learning methods which require extensive labeled data and fail on unseen designs.

Method: The proposed LayoutCoder framework utilizes three modules: (1) Element Relation Construction to identify and group UI components, (2) UI Layout Parsing to create layout trees, and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion to generate accurate code preserving the layout.

Result: LayoutCoder demonstrates superior performance on the Snap2Code and Design2Code datasets, with improvements of 10.14% in BLEU score and 3.95% in CLIP score compared to leading methods.

Conclusion: LayoutCoder effectively addresses the challenges of UI2Code conversion by leveraging layout information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in precision and robustness even on unseen web page designs.

Abstract: Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website
development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of
UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the
development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;
however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and
struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating
the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and
generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we
propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from
real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element
Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and
grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims
at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation
process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the
accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark
dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into
seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the
popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior
performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with
the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and
3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.

*Mir Mohammad Yousuf,Shabir Ahmad Sofi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a rule-based framework for classifying quantum software bugs and evaluates its accuracy and effectiveness through manual comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate bug classification in quantum software repositories, focusing on quantum-specific bugs and their impact.

Method: A rule-based framework using keyword and heuristic approaches is developed and evaluated on 12,910 issues across Qiskit repositories using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

Result: The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy. Most bugs were classical (67.2%) and low severity (93.7%), with quantum-specific bugs constituting 27.3%.

Conclusion: The framework reliably classifies bug types and categories, though severity classification needs improvement. Insights into quantum vs. classical bug distributions were provided.

Abstract: Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software
quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying
issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and
impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug
types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to
quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a
stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36
Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth
using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to
85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393
(quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's
Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696),
category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug
type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162),
suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical
bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug
categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects,
while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted
quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were
critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over
half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and
hardware-related issues.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes 308 fixed bugs in popular distributed training and inference frameworks to understand their symptoms, root causes, and fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance quality assurance for distributed training and inference frameworks, which are critical for scaling large language models but prone to complex bugs.

Method: A large-scale empirical analysis was conducted on 308 fixed bugs across three frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI, focusing on bug symptoms, root causes, and fixing strategies.

Result: It identifies unique bug causes like allocation strategy and communication errors. Additionally, 48% of fixes are simple (<10 LOC), suggesting potential for automation.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights to improve framework reliability and proposes leveraging LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed
training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for
scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However,
the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,
which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result
in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is
fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective
debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale
empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed
training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We
examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and
common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of
these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy
error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs
remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and
root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component
interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal
code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic
optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility
handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we
offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed
training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also
identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging
and repair.

*Fangwen Mu,Junjie Wang,Lin Shi,Song Wang,Shoubin Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ExpeRepair, an LLM-based approach that utilizes a dual-memory system to improve software repair by integrating episodic and semantic memory for context-aware dynamic prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based software repair methods are limited as they treat issues in isolation and use static prompting strategies, reducing their adaptability and learning potential.

Method: ExpeRepair uses a system inspired by human cognition, employing episodic memory for concrete repair demonstrations and semantic memory for abstract insights, both of which are integrated dynamically during inference to guide repairs.

Result: ExpeRepair achieves a notable result of 49.3% pass@1 score on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art open-source methods.

Conclusion: ExpeRepair demonstrates that combining episodic and semantic memory with dynamic, experience-driven prompts can significantly improve LLM-based software repair systems.

Abstract: Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at
the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for
repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable
limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to
incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on
static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to
generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual
memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work
synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose
ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical
repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair
organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an
episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic
memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair
activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from
episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.
It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,
synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with
context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BugGen is an autonomous pipeline leveraging Large Language Models to generate, insert, and validate realistic RTL bugs, enhancing debugging and verification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing hardware complexity strains verification resources, necessitating the use of scalable and effective methods, such as machine learning, to enhance debugging efficiency. However, the reliability and diversity of bug datasets pose a significant challenge.

Method: BugGen employs a multi-agent pipeline driven by Large Language Models. This system autonomously partitions modules, selects mutation targets, and uses iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to generate functional bugs with high accuracy. It also includes a closed-loop architecture for real-time validation.

Result: BugGen was tested on OpenTitan IP blocks, generating 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and a throughput of 17.7 bugs per hour. It detected 104 previously unseen bugs in OpenTitan regressions and outperformed the Certitude tool in multiple aspects, including syntactic accuracy and testing blind spots.

Conclusion: BugGen provides a scalable and reliable solution for generating high-quality bugs, significantly improving the potential of machine learning-based debugging and verification processes.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Motivation: LLMs face challenges in balancing efficiency and inference costs for diverse programming tasks, and existing selection methods are resource-intensive and rely on unreliable human annotations of task difficulty.

Method: AdaptiveLLM uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to estimate task difficulty, clusters difficulty levels using k-means, fine-tunes CodeBERT for difficulty-aware features, and employs an XGBoost classifier for optimal LLM selection.

Result: The framework improves pass@1 score by 7.86%, reduces resource usage by 88.9% compared to ComplexityNet, and offers a 15% accuracy improvement over single models with similar cost efficiency.

Conclusion: AdaptiveLLM is more reliable than human evaluations for task difficulty and provides an effective, cost-efficient method for dynamic LLM selection in code generation tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code
generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance
and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the
optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a
promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and
performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive
and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on
human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in
real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task
difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that
dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically
assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using
Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into
three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed
difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best
model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental
results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score
while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method
ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an
approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of
cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides
more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package
is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.

### [338] [Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654)
*Abir Bouraffa,Carolin Brandt,Andy Zaidmann,Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Developers reviewing GitHub pull requests often comment in non-alphabetical orders, favoring strategies like largest-diff-first or test-first, depending on the context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the navigation strategies that reviewers use in commenting on pull requests, as current alphabetical ordering may not align with reviewer preferences.

Method: Analyzed review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular GitHub Java and Python repositories to investigate navigation orders used by reviewers.

Result: 44.6% of pull requests had comments in non-alphabetical order. Reviewers preferred alternative strategies like largest-diff-first (20.6%), test-first (29%), or similarity to title/description (17.6%). Non-alphabetical reviews had higher engagement but slightly fewer approvals.

Conclusion: Code review tools could be improved to support personalized or flexible file navigation strategies, especially for handling larger pull requests where complex commenting patterns emerge.

Abstract: Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss
proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly
presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the
reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different
navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in
pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100
popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which
the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for
44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order.
Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful
orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were
commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and
description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both
production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that
the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly
higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly
fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for
additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests,
where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than
following a single predefined order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in traceability and verification of software requirements, ensuring their alignment from initial design through implementation.

Method: The VERIFAI project integrates Natural Language Processing, ontologies, similarity-based reuse, large language models, and AI to enable automatic generation and traceability of formal specifications.

Result: While specific outcomes are not detailed, the project proposes innovative methodologies to enhance software requirements traceability and verification.

formal specifications and the traceability of the requirements from the initial
software design stage through the systems implementation and verification.
Approaches explored in this project include Natural Language Processing, use of

language models to identify and declare the specifications as well as use of
artificial intelligence to guide the process.

*Joran Leest,Claudia Raibulet,Patricia Lago,Ilias Gerostathopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies the limitation of current ML monitoring systems in addressing contextual misalignments. It introduces the C-SAR framework to systematically categorize contextual information for better ML monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in ML monitoring and related fields like drift detection and out-of-distribution detection, there is no clear consensus on how to leverage contextual information for effective monitoring.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed 94 studies across various fields and proposed the Contextual System–Aspect–Representation (C-SAR) framework, which organizes contextual information in ML monitoring.

Result: The study unveiled 20 reusable patterns of system, aspect, and representation combinations and linked them to monitoring activities, providing meaningful insights into the field.

Conclusion: The research moves ML monitoring from arbitrary statistical interpretations to a structured, context-driven approach for robust and systematic monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models in production do not fail due to statistical
anomalies in their input data; they fail due to contextual misalignment -- when
their environment deviates from training assumptions, leading to unreliable
predictions. Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to
move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and
systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research
in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation,
out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use
contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves
interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a
systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual
information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across
data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the
Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model
that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially
reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations,
and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a
new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of
observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that
enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes 894K reviews of AI-powered apps from Google Play, using a validated multi-stage pipeline to extract nuanced user sentiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how users perceive, evaluate, and critique AI-driven mobile apps across various domains, addressing the challenge posed by the large volume of user feedback.

Method: The paper develops a multi-stage analysis pipeline validated for accuracy and consistency, employing human-labeled benchmarks and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering.

Result: The pipeline identified over one million aspect-sentiment pairs, categorizing feedback into 18 positive and 15 negative themes. Users focused on a narrow set of themes: productivity, reliability, personalized assistance (positive) and technical issues, pricing, language support limits (negative).

Conclusion: The nuanced, co-occurring sentiments found in user feedback offer a deeper understanding of satisfaction and frustrations with AI-powered apps, providing insights that traditional coarse-grained analysis often misses.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

*Fabian C. Peña,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SELU, a benchmark to assess LLM performance on 17 non-code Software Engineering tasks, revealing moderate-scale models excel while code-focused pre-training yields limited gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are well-known for their prowess in code-related tasks, but their capability on non-code SE tasks has not been sufficiently studied or benchmarked.

Method: The paper fine-tunes 22 open-source LLMs, evaluates 2 proprietary models, and trains 2 baseline approaches. Performance is measured with classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition, and Masked Language Modeling targets across various metrics.

Result: Moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently perform the best, showcasing high overall performance across tasks and low variability. Code-focused domain adaptation offers minor improvements.

Conclusion: Moderate-scale decoder-only LLMs are ideal for non-code SE tasks. The results encourage expanding SELU to also include generative and design scenarios, aiding model selection for diverse workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code
Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first
comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language
Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from
identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating
the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification,
regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue
tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs,
prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is
measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and
compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that
moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting
high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via
code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights
guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for
expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.

*Quinn Thibeault,Giulia Pedrielli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiCoSim is a Python-based co-simulation framework designed to address limitations in current cyber-physical system simulations by providing flexible, modular, and programmatically configurable tools for the simulation of complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-physical systems are becoming increasingly complex, especially in safety-critical and learning-enabled scenarios. Existing simulation tools have limitations such as rigid configurations, lack of automation, and challenges with portability, making it difficult to conduct efficient, reusable, and modular simulation for analysis and development.

Method: The authors proposed MultiCoSim—a Python-based simulation framework that supports distributed, component-based co-simulation. MultiCoSim enables users to programmatically define, compose, and configure simulation components, allowing for seamless substitution, reconfiguration, and interoperability across platforms.

Result: MultiCoSim’s flexibility and utility were validated through case studies, including custom automaton-based controllers and integration with platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics, demonstrating enhanced simulation workflows.

Conclusion: MultiCoSim simplifies and improves the simulation process for cyber-physical systems, addressing the major challenges in existing tools by enabling modularity, portability, and adaptability in simulation pipelines.

Abstract: Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of
cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm
development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in
complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled
settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of
simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,
and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of
heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances
in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in
diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the
development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for
automated and comparative evaluation.
  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation
support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are
configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation
components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly
compose systems or integrate components across platforms.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based
simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure
simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed,
component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and
reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim
through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom
automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf
platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight
MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and
development.

*Lianghong Guo,Yanlin Wang,Caihua Li,Pengyu Yang,Jiachi Chen,Wei Tao,Yingtian Zou,Duyu Tang,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale GitHub issue resolution task datasets, reducing labor and ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of constructing large-scale benchmarks for evaluating software engineering capabilities using Large Language Models is labor-intensive, especially in setting up environments, grading, and validating tasks.

Method: The paper proposes SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed with three components: SWE-Builder for constructing evaluation environments, a standardized exit-code-based grading system, and an automated fail2pass validation process.

Result: Experiments on 671 GitHub issues demonstrate SWE-Factory’s effectiveness. For instance, SWE-Builder constructs instances at a low cost (e.g., $0.045 with GPT-4.1-mini) while achieving high grading accuracy (100%) and reliable validation precision (0.92) and recall (1.00).

Conclusion: SWE-Factory addresses the challenges of dataset construction for GitHub issue resolution, providing an efficient and accurate solution. It aims to foster large-scale dataset collection and enhance LLM training and evaluation in software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

### [345] [Fundamental Limits of Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10101)
*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper sets sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in noisy environments, providing both upper and lower bounds. It proposes new theoretical insights and a method with reduced complexity in high-SNR cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of learning the geometry of high-dimensional simplices from noisy samples, a common problem in areas such as data science and signal processing. Prior work lacked sharp bounds for noisy cases and efficient estimation methods.

Method: The authors utilize sample compression techniques and introduce a Fourier-based method to recover distributions from noisy data while deriving both upper and lower bounds for simplex estimation.

Result: The paper proves that simplex estimation complexity is $
abla K/
u$ in a high SNR setup and aligns with noiseless scenarios given SNR $
abla ≥ \K.inline missing the correctness of Ω...$ details their advancement.

Conclusion: They resolve an open question by aligning noisy and noiseless sample complexity for manageable noise levels, with their techniques offering broader applicability in distribution estimation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3MSBM, a novel framework to learn smoother trajectories and capture temporal dependencies in sparse sample snapshots across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methodologies struggle with capturing long-range temporal dependencies due to reliance on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots.

Method: The framework lifts dynamics to phase space and generalizes stochastic bridges conditioned on multiple points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem.

Result: 3MSBM significantly improves convergence and scalability, better capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies across various real-world applications.

Conclusion: The approach opens opportunities for multi-marginal matching frameworks in capturing and analyzing trajectories of complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the continuum between adversarial and stochastic settings in online learning using distributionally constrained adversaries, extending and generalizing results in smoothed settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between stochastic and adversarial settings in online learning and provide a framework for understanding learnability under various distribution classes chosen by adversaries.

Method: The authors use a characterization approach to explore which distribution classes are learnable and analyze learning outcomes against oblivious and adaptive adversaries. They also provide insights into the interplay between function classes and distribution constraints.

Result: The paper generalizes existing smoothed settings while identifying learnable distribution classes. It shows that learners can achieve non-trivial regret without prior knowledge of distribution classes in natural examples, like linear classifiers.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of learnability under constrained adversarial distributions, offering new insights into achieving competitive results across various adversarial scenarios without prior distribution knowledge.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

*Florian Handke,Félix Koulischer,Gabriel Raya,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper measures when semantic and structural features emerge during image generation via an information-theoretic approach, finding peak semantic information transfer in intermediate diffusion stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when and how semantic decisions occur during the reverse dynamics of diffusion models, inspired by physical phase transitions.

Method: Use a Bayesian classifier to compute conditional entropy and analyze information transfer during diffusion processes using time derivatives.

Result: Semantic information transfer peaks in intermediate diffusion stages, with class-dependent differences in entropy rate profiles.

Conclusion: Semantic decision-making processes differ across classes and occur at distinct intermediate diffusion times.

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the BCSoftmax function, which applies hard constraints to output probabilities for enhancing reliability and calibration in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of hard constraints in controlling output probabilities in softmax-based models, which is critical for reliable applications.

Method: The BCSoftmax function is designed as a solution to a box-constrained optimization problem. The authors provide an efficient computation algorithm and propose two calibration methods based on this function.

Result: Experiments on datasets like TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups show improved calibration metrics and reliability of predictions using BCSoftmax.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax and its application in post-hoc calibration methods improve the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning models, particularly in scenarios requiring controlled probability outputs.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

### [350] [Logarithmic Smoothing for Adaptive PAC-Bayesian Off-Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10664)
*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) to adaptive off-policy learning, allowing iterative policy improvement through online learning and deployment, achieving superior performance in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond static off-policy learning towards a more practical, adaptive framework that can iteratively refine policies and collect better data, enabling faster convergence and improved performance.

Method: The authors use online PAC-Bayesian theory to extend the PAC-Bayesian LS framework to adaptive off-policy learning. They also introduce adjustments to the LS estimator for handling multiple policy deployment rounds, ensuring faster convergence rates.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable results to leading offline approaches in static settings, but outperforms them notably in adaptive scenarios where policies are refined iteratively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that adaptive data collection combined with a PAC-Bayesian formulation significantly enhances policy learning, particularly in dynamic settings with intermediate deployments.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and

### [351] [Practical Improvements of A/B Testing with Off-Policy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10677)
*Sakhi Otmane,Gilotte Alexandre,Rohde David*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a more efficient unbiased estimator for A/B testing that reduces variance compared to the traditional difference-in-means estimator, especially when the tested systems are similar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the commonly used difference-in-means estimator for A/B testing, which is unbiased but suboptimal in terms of variance.

Method: The authors introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators, identify the one with the lowest variance, and validate their approach through both theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves substantial variance reduction while maintaining unbiasedness, particularly in cases where the two systems being tested exhibit similarities.

Conclusion: The introduced estimator is both effective in reducing variance and practical for application in A/B testing scenarios.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates causal effect estimation with hidden confounders via nonparametric instrumental variable regression, analyzing performance conditions using spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve causal effect estimation methods in scenarios involving hidden confounders, particularly by analyzing failings and strengths of spectral feature-based methods.

Method: Derived a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator using spectral features and categorized performance outcomes based on key factors: spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.

Result: The analysis provides a taxonomy of 'good,' 'bad,' and 'ugly' outcomes in spectral-based approaches, with synthetic experiments confirming theoretical insights.

Conclusion: Spectral feature-based methods are optimal under specific conditions; however, alignment issues or weak instruments can lead to performance degradation or failure.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

### [353] [Probably Approximately Correct Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10908)
*Emmanuel J. Candès,Andrew Ilyas,Tijana Zrnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective method to label datasets by combining expert labels with AI predictions, ensuring low error probability across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling high-quality datasets is expensive and time-consuming, often relying on human annotation or costly experiments.

Method: The method integrates AI predictions from pre-trained models with expert labels to create datasets that are probably approximately correct (low probability of labeling error).

Result: The approach was validated through text annotation using large language models, image labeling with vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Conclusion: This methodology reduces dataset curation costs while maintaining labeling accuracy and rigor using modern AI models.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [354] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines how masked discrete diffusion models using classifier-free guidance (CFG) influence sampling behavior and explores the geometric and dynamic effects of varying guidance strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand and characterize how classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models influences the sampling behavior, with a focus on the dynamics and geometry of the process.

Method: The authors derived an explicit solution for guided reverse dynamics, analyzed the effects of guidance strength $w$ on sampling behaviors and covariance structures, and performed experiments to validate their theoretical findings.

Result: It was found that guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppressing shared regions, and that guidance strength $w$ induces distinct covariance structures. The total variation decay rate along reverse dynamics was shown to be double-exponential in $w$, with quantitative differences between $1$D and $2$D cases.

Conclusion: Guidance in diffusion models not only shapes the output distribution but also has a significant impact on the dynamics of the sampling process, as validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

*David Farr,Kevin Talty,Alexandra Farr,John Stockdale,Iain Cruickshank,Jevin West*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting vulnerabilities in Python code, finding few-shot prompting strategies significantly improve performance and emphasize AI-human collaboration for cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates rapid and accurate detection of vulnerabilities to maintain secure systems.

Method: The study analyzes how LLMs can identify vulnerabilities in Python code by testing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies, complemented by confidence-based routing and expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making.

Result: Few-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot prompting in classification tasks, especially when combined with confidence-based routing to direct human intervention for ambiguous cases. LLMs demonstrated the ability to generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as scalable and adaptable tools for vulnerability detection in simulated environments. However, challenges including reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness must be addressed for real-world deployment.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

### [356] [D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125)
*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: D-LiFT is an automated decompiler backend leveraging large language models and reinforcement learning to improve decompiled code quality while emphasizing accuracy and readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decompiled code often suffers from inaccuracies and poor readability, limiting its effectiveness in security tasks.

Method: D-LiFT employs reinforcement learning to train large language models, combined with D-SCORE, a scoring system that evaluates code for syntactic accuracy, semantic correctness, and readability.

Result: D-LiFT achieved a 55.3% improvement in processing decompiled functions compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated on the coreutils and util-linux projects.

Conclusion: By preserving accuracy and enhancing readability, D-LiFT significantly refines decompiled code quality, making it a promising advancement in decompiler technology.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

### [357] [ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323)
*Chuyang Chen,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELFuzz, a fuzz testing approach powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates the creation of generation-based fuzzers for software systems. Compared to traditional methods, ELFuzz achieves significantly higher coverage and bug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generation-based fuzzing requires manual effort to construct input grammars and semantic constraints, limiting scalability and efficiency. The motivation is to create an automated approach to address these limitations, leveraging LLMs to synthesize appropriate fuzzers.

Method: ELFuzz uses LLM-driven synthesis to evolve minimal seed fuzzers into customized generation-based fuzzers for the System Under Test (SUT). This process is guided by code coverage metrics to iteratively refine fuzzers in an automated manner.

Result: ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Importantly, it identified five 0-day bugs (including three exploitable ones) in a real-world fuzzing campaign, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: ELFuzz introduces a novel, extensible, and automated fuzzing approach that scales effectively to real-world systems and synthesizes human-understandable fuzzers. Its results highlight its potential to advance the field of software testing through better bug detection and coverage performance.

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAAI, a method to generate synthetic harmful data for LLMs without requiring human-labeled data, improving safety alignment and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for safer alignment of LLMs without relying on costly human-labeled preference data.

Method: RAAI repurposes LLM attack techniques using predefined phrases and refusal signal detection to generate harmful synthetic data.

Result: RAAI significantly increases harmful response rates for LLMs and, when fine-tuned with the generated synthetic data, improves model robustness in handling harmful prompts.

Conclusion: RAAI proposes a scalable, training-free approach for safety alignment, demonstrating effective use of synthetic data for improving LLM reliability without complex methods.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

*Haoyang Li,Huan Gao,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zhiyu Lin,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalwareBench, a dataset for benchmarking LLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak prompts in malicious code generation, highlighting their limited rejection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks specifically in malicious code generation.

Method: Develop MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset of 3,520 jailbreak prompts based on 320 crafted requirements, evaluating LLM robustness across 11 methods and 29 functionality categories.

Result: Mainstream LLMs have a rejection rate of 60.93% for standalone malicious requirements, but combining jailbreak methods reduces this rate to 39.92%.

Conclusion: LLMs currently lack robust security against malicious code generation requirements, and addressing these challenges remains critical.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Private Memorization Editing (PME), a method to prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by editing how models memorize training data without compromising overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have the risk of memorizing and potentially leaking PII, posing privacy threats that need a mitigation strategy.

Method: The proposed PME approach identifies memorized PII in LLMs and edits the model's knowledge of its training data to reduce the risk of privacy data extraction, while preserving the original model's capabilities.

Result: PME effectively decreases the leakage of PII in multiple scenarios and in certain configurations eliminates privacy attacks entirely by reducing their accuracy to zero.

Conclusion: The PME method successfully mitigates privacy risks in LLMs without degrading their general language modeling capabilities, converting their memorization into a privacy-defense tool.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the

*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AQUA is a watermarking framework designed to protect image knowledge in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through semantic signals that are robust, imperceptible, and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods only protect textual knowledge in RAG systems, neglecting image data, which is critical as RAG evolves into shared, service-oriented platforms.

Method: AQUA embeds semantic signals in synthetic images using acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues, ensuring such signals persist through indirect propagation from image retrievers to textual generators.

Result: The framework exhibits robust, stealthy, and reliable performance in copyright tracing across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: AQUA addresses a previously unprotected area in multimodal RAG systems, offering a necessary tool for safeguarding image knowledge in a way that is imperceptible and robust.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMPL, a framework for auditing privacy risks in conversational agents, focusing on iterative probing to simulate multi-turn dialogues and uncover vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of Large Language Model agents in sensitive roles such as personal assistants and clinical aides highlights the need to address potential privacy risks due to their access to sensitive data.

Method: The authors propose CMPL, an iterative probing strategy that simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically reveal privacy vulnerabilities in conversational agents enforcing privacy directives.

Result: CMPL effectively uncovers privacy risks across varied domains and configurations, demonstrating vulnerabilities that existing single-turn defenses fail to address.

Conclusion: The study provides CMPL as a robust diagnostic tool for auditing conversational privacy, along with a procedure based on quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for comparative evaluations of privacy in conversational agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

### [364] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenBreak, a framework to expose vulnerabilities in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion by generating adversarial prompts that evade defenses and produce harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models face safety risks as they can be exploited to create harmful content, and existing research lacks reliable tools to fully evaluate their safety against adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors developed GenBreak, a red-team large language model fine-tuned using supervised learning and reinforcement learning to systematically craft adversarial prompts for text-to-image generators.

Result: GenBreak effectively generates prompts that bypass safety mechanisms and produce harmful and toxic content, demonstrating significant weaknesses in defended text-to-image frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights practical safety vulnerabilities in commercial text-to-image models, emphasizing the need for improved defense mechanisms and evaluation tools.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the vulnerability of machine unlearning methods to prompt attacks and provides an evaluation framework for assessing unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing machine unlearning methods truly remove learned knowledge or simply suppress it superficially.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to test the retrievability of supposedly unlearned knowledge.

Result: Key findings include the vulnerability of ELM to specific prompt attacks like Hindi filler text, achieving a surprising 57.3% recovery accuracy. Strong correlation was noted between output and logit accuracy, ruling out knowledge hiding through answer reformatting.

Conclusion: The study challenges current assumptions about unlearning effectiveness, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation frameworks, and provides a publicly available tool to assess unlearning knowledge retrieval vulnerability.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the privacy vulnerabilities of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to membership inference attacks and proposes a defense method called SOFT to mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the increasing use of LLMs in applications where sensitive information is used, prompting concerns about privacy risks during fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose SOFT (Selective data Obfuscation in LLM Fine-Tuning), which involves influential data selection with adjustable parameters to balance the trade-off between model utility and privacy protection.

Result: Extensive experiments in diverse domains across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SOFT effectively reduces privacy leakage while maintaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: SOFT provides a scalable and practical solution to protect sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs, addressing significant privacy concerns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

### [367] [Specification and Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLM Systems -- Prototype and Cybersecurity Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10467)
*Felix Härer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the utilization of multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) for specialized applications beyond text generation, focusing on reasoning, code generation, and software execution. Using task-specific evaluations like cybersecurity, the authors propose and test an architecture prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the untapped potential of LLM-based multi-agent approaches in specialized applications, and to provide structured evaluations and specifications for these systems.

Method: The authors developed a multi-agent system prototype extended from previous research, introducing specifications for task-based evaluations. They applied this system to cybersecurity tasks like server and network security.

Result: The study demonstrated feasible applications of LLMs in multi-agent systems for cybersecurity tasks, achieving accurate results in question answering and security-related problem-solving using OpenAI and DeepSeek models.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems built with LLMs are promising for complex and specialized tasks. However, systematic specifications and evaluations are necessary for realizing their full potential.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

*S. Vasavi Venkata Lakshmi,Ziaul Haque Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study discusses using quantum cryptography, specifically QKD, BB84, and QOTP, to secure cloud computing against threats posed by quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of securing cloud data in the era of quantum computing, as traditional methods may become outdated.

Method: The paper integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with the BB84 protocol and Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption.

Result: The proposed quantum cryptography techniques were applied effectively to secure cloud environments from quantum threats.

Conclusion: The combination of QKD, BB84, and QOTP offers a future-proof and robust framework for cloud data security.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

*Xunguang Wang,Zhenlan Ji,Wenxuan Wang,Zongjie Li,Daoyuan Wu,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified taxonomy and evaluation framework for jailbreak guardrails in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing vulnerabilities of LLMs, such as jailbreak attacks, necessitate robust defense mechanisms. Existing guardrails lack standardization and evaluation guidelines.

Method: A novel six-dimensional taxonomy and a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework were developed to comprehensively analyze and evaluate guardrail effectiveness.

Result: The study identifies the strengths and limitations of current guardrails, examines their adaptability across attacks, and provides guidance on combining defense methods for optimal protection.

Conclusion: This work establishes a structured foundation for improving and advancing LLM guardrails, offering tools and insights to foster more secure deployment of these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TED-LaST, an enhanced defense against adaptive backdoor attacks in deep neural networks, improving the robustness of Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) methods, which are vulnerable to adaptive backdoor attacks that distort topological representation across network layers.

Method: Introduced TED-LaST, which incorporates label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis to detect stealthy backdoor attacks. Proposed an enhanced adaptive backdoor attack strategy to evaluate robustness.

Result: TED-LaST effectively countered diverse backdoor attacks, including advanced adaptive ones, in experiments conducted on datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, ImageNet100) and models (ResNet20, ResNet101).

Conclusion: TED-LaST significantly improves defense mechanisms in DNNs, setting a new standard for robust backdoor detection against evolving, adaptive attack strategies.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in the SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) attack method on generative diffusion models and introduces new datasets and methods to improve attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficacy of generative model attacks like SilentBadDiffusion (SBD), overcoming issues like limited data resources and unsatisfactory performance under low poisoning sample conditions.

Method: The new Multi-Element (ME) attack method adds more poisonous elements to each sample and utilizes Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to enhance stealthiness. Additionally, it introduces new datasets for testing the method.

Result: The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) and First Attack Epoch (FAE) on the new datasets showed significant improvements, outperforming benchmarks under certain conditions, especially with a low subsampling ratio.

Conclusion: By providing new datasets and refining the attack strategy, the paper enhances generative model attack capabilities while ensuring stealthiness, making it a step forward in adversarial research.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

### [372] [A Crack in the Bark: Leveraging Public Knowledge to Remove Tree-Ring Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10502)
*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack on the Tree-Ring watermarking technique for diffusion models using publicly available variational autoencoders, significantly lowering detection effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess vulnerabilities in the Tree-Ring watermarking method for diffusion models, particularly by challenging its robustness and imperceptibility claims, while evaluating industry assumptions about using public autoencoders during training.

Method: Utilization of a publicly accessible variational autoencoder to approximate the target diffusion model's latent space, enabling improved effectiveness of surrogate-based attacks against Tree-Ring watermarking.

Result: The attack dramatically reduces the AUC of the detector's ROC and PR curves (from 0.993 to 0.153 and 0.994 to 0.385, respectively) and maintains high image quality, outperforming methods even with full access to the diffusion model.

Conclusion: Public reuse of autoencoders during training introduces significant security vulnerabilities for diffusion model watermarking and Tree-Ring detectors require enhanced precision for practical deployment.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

### [373] [Assessing the Resilience of Automotive Intrusion Detection Systems to Adversarial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10620)
*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks on automotive intrusion detection systems (IDSs), considering scenarios with varying levels of attacker knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vehicles' increasing connectivity and lack of strong CAN bus security make them vulnerable to cyberattacks, necessitating an analysis of the effectiveness of adversarial attacks against IDSs.

Method: The paper investigates gradient-based adversarial evasion attacks in three scenarios (white-box, grey-box, and black-box), evaluates them against state-of-the-art IDSs using two public datasets, and studies the practicality of timed payload injections.

Result: The study finds that adversarial attack effectiveness depends heavily on domain constraints, dataset quality, IDS design, and the attacker's level of knowledge.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a real threat to automotive IDSs, but their success hinges on specific factors, underscoring the need for improved IDS robustness and security measures.

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

*Chen Yueh-Han,Nitish Joshi,Yulin Chen,Maksym Andriushchenko,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces lightweight sequential monitoring to defend against decomposition attacks on LLMs, achieving a high defense success rate while being cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety techniques fail against decomposition attacks, where malicious instructions are hidden within harmless-looking sequences.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that tracks conversation context to detect cumulative malicious intent in subtasks.

Result: Their framework achieves a 93% defense success rate, outperforms reasoning models, and significantly reduces cost and latency.

Conclusion: Lightweight sequential monitors are effective in real-time defense against decomposition attacks and show practical deployability.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The RAW-HF framework optimizes querying of raw data and resource utilization, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional DBMS and other modern techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in data querying and resource management in traditional and in-situ database systems, which result in higher costs and extended execution times.

Method: Proposed a Resource Availability & Workload aware Hybrid Framework (RAW-HF) with optimization modules, tested on real-world workloads like SDSS and LOD.

Result: RAW-HF achieved over 90% and 85% reductions in workload execution time compared to PostgreSQL. CPU, IO, and WET were reduced by ~26%, while memory utilization improved by 33% compared to alternative methods.

Conclusion: RAW-HF significantly improves system efficiency and querying performance, representing a valuable contribution to workload and resource optimization for data-intensive applications.

Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts
of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud
resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database
management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to
load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other
hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing
resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or
under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This
paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid
Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite
resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources
required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing
resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset
workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data
(LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET)
compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO
resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%,
respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the
state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for
hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine
learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The proposed SC-CEE-Meta architecture improves metaverse VR experiences by reducing latency and enhancing image quality through semantic communication and cloud-edge-end collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address wireless transmission bottlenecks, high latency, and quality degradation in VR-based metaverse environments due to bandwidth limitations and poor channel quality.

Method: The SC-CEE-Meta is a three-module architecture leveraging semantic communication, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction deployed collaboratively across cloud, edge servers, and VR devices.

Result: The architecture reduced wireless transmission delay by 96.05% and improved image quality by 43.99% under poor channel conditions when tested on Meta Quest Pro.

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta addresses critical challenges in VR metaverse services and enhances user experiences by leveraging semantic information and collaborative resource allocation.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

*Jianwu Fang,Lei-Lei Li,Zhedong Zheng,Hongkai Yu,Jianru Xue,Zhengguo Li,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to address the difficulties in Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) caused by inherent scene issues and data bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAA models struggle with annotation requirements and background confounding issues in identifying causal accident factors.

Method: The proposed AVD model generates additional accident video clips from normal scenes via text prompts to overcome data bias and causal identification issues.

Result: AVD achieves competitive performance in generating relevant causal accident footage and helps improve TAA using the equivariant triple loss approach.

Conclusion: AVD and EQ-TAA provide a practical, annotation-free framework for better understanding and anticipating accidents in traffic scenes.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive bimodal framework for HER2 breast cancer prediction that improves accuracy for single- and dual-modality assessments without requiring synchronized acquisition, especially benefiting resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for HER2 assessment analyze H&E or IHC images individually, yet clinical practice benefits from their combined interpretation. The cost and complexity of acquiring both modalities simultaneously limit widespread adoption, calling for innovative solutions.

Method: The study designs a dynamic bimodal framework featuring a branch selector for modality activation, a bidirectional cross-modal GAN for reconstructing missing data, and a hybrid training protocol blending adversarial learning with multi-task optimization.

Result: The framework elevates single-modality (H&E) prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% accuracy for dual-modality inputs, and improves reliability to 90.28% with IHC alone. Cross-modal reconstruction boosts F1-scores significantly, while computational efficiency is enhanced with a 78.55% parameter reduction in lightweight models.

Conclusion: By accommodating single-modality inputs and leveraging dual-modality performance potential, this adaptive system offers more accessible and precise HER2 assessment, making it particularly impactful in lower-resource environments.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key limitations in emotional 3D facial animation, enabling more flexible and expressive animations.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

### [381] [Structured Graph Representations for Visual Narrative Reasoning: A Hierarchical Framework for Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10008)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for understanding visual narratives, specifically in multimodal media like comics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in structured understanding and interpretation of visual narratives in comics by combining macro-level story arcs with fine-grained segments using knowledge graphs.

Method: The method involves constructing multimodal knowledge graphs to represent relationships at different narrative levels, integrating semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions.

Result: The framework was evaluated on a subset of the Manga109 dataset, showing high precision and recall in tasks like action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character mapping, and timeline reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable tool for analyzing visual narratives, enabling applications in storytelling and multimodal content reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

### [382] [WDMIR: Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10011)
*Weiyin Gong,Kai Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Qi Liu,Xinjie Sun,Junyu Lu,Linbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR), combining verbal and non-verbal cues to improve user intent interpretation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal intent recognition methods overly emphasize text cues, neglecting rich semantic information present in non-verbal signals.

Method: The WDMIR framework leverages a wavelet-driven fusion module for synchronized video-audio feature analysis and a cross-modal mechanism to integrate verbal and non-verbal information progressively.

Result: Experiments show WDMIR outperforms prior methods on accuracy by 1.13%, with the wavelet-driven fusion module improving non-verbal cue recognition by 0.41%.

Conclusion: Wavelet-driven analysis and seamless cross-modal integration are effective in improving multimodal intent recognition by capturing and utilizing non-verbal semantic content.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper surveys the advancements and methodologies underpinning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate diverse sensory modalities for various outputs beyond text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured understanding of how MLLMs combine language with modalities like images, video, and 3D objects, and to address open challenges in building general-purpose and adaptable multimodal systems.

Method: Categorized six generative modalities, studied foundational techniques (e.g., SSL, MoE, RLHF, CoT), analyzed key models and architectural trends, and identified patterns and challenges in cross-modal synergies.

Result: Highlighted the role of architectures like transformers and diffusion models, revealed transferable techniques, and identified unresolved challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning.

Conclusion: Presented a unified overview of MLLM development, reinforcing the need for innovative techniques to achieve adaptive and interpretable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [384] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper explores how emotionally expressive speech aligns with facial and hand gestures during human interactions, emphasizing the role of speech overlap and arousal in coordinating multimodal signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the dynamics of emotional expression through multimodal interactions, focusing on speech alignment with facial and hand gestures, and the challenges posed by conversational structures like speech overlap.

Method: The study used motion capture data from dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus, analyzing speech features (prosody, MFCCs, emotional states) alongside 3D displacements of facial and hand markers. It quantified expressiveness and mapped speech features to gestures.

Result: Key findings include: nonoverlapping speech elicited greater expressiveness, particularly in the lower face and mouth; sadness increased expressivity during nonoverlap; anger suppressed gestures in overlapping speech; predictive accuracy was highest with prosody and MFCCs when focused on articulatory facial movements, while arousal/valence correlations were context-dependent.

Conclusion: Emotion detection can be optimized by analyzing multimodal synchrony in human interactions, offering improvements for both psychological understanding and AI systems. Speech overlap and arousal play critical roles in shaping emotional expressivity.

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

### [385] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores the practical applications of the Gittins index in decision-making problems, including its application to Bayesian optimization and minimizing queue latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to showcase the Gittins index as a practical tool rather than a purely theoretical concept, identifying its utility in solving complex decision-making problems.

Method: An example-driven tutorial approach is employed to introduce the Gittins index and illustrate its performance in both optimal and suboptimal problem-solving scenarios.

Result: The Gittins index demonstrates excellent performance in several applications, including Bayesian optimization and tail latency minimization in queue systems.

Conclusion: The Gittins index, despite its subtle definition and theoretical origin, can be effectively utilized as a practical decision-making tool in various applications.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

### [386] [Structure and asymptotic preserving deep neural surrogates for uncertainty quantification in multiscale kinetic equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10636)
*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The study addresses the computational challenges in uncertainty quantification for kinetic equations by combining Monte Carlo sampling with multiscale control variates and Physics-informed neural networks to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters are computationally demanding for uncertainty quantification, and standard Monte Carlo methods are inefficient with slow convergence and high variance.

Method: The authors propose a combined approach using multiscale control variates with surrogate models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs), which integrate physical properties into neural networks.

Result: The approach significantly reduces variance, enhances efficiency, maintains physical consistency, and improves accuracy when compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: The methodology provides an effective and computationally efficient pathway for large-scale prediction in kinetic uncertainty quantification across various regimes.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

*Rudy Alexandro Garrido Veliz,Martin Semmann,Chris Biemann,Seid Muhie Yimam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel coding scheme to identify neo-fascist digital discourse in the U.S., leveraging political science and NLP tools. Using annotated data from online neo-fascist forums, researchers develop classification models to detect such rhetoric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the dangerous rise of neo-fascism in western societies, posing threats to democracy and marginalized groups, necessitating active counteraction.

Method: Researchers create a coding scheme, collect posts from neo-fascist forums, annotate a subset of the data, and fine-tune Small and Large Language Models to classify neo-fascist discourse.

Result: The classification models demonstrate the persistently high prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in targeted forums, suggesting suitability for further research.

Conclusion: Neo-fascism is a persistent threat requiring continued efforts to combat its rhetoric, especially leveraging NLP for societal well-being and democratic stability.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating personalized answers for learners via an analysis of StackExchange queries in language learning and programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the online learning experience through personalization by generating tailored answers to learners' unique queries and reducing educators' workloads.

Method: Developed a framework and dataset for validating personalized answers generated by LLMs, employing methods like 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot strategies, followed by evaluation using BERTScore, LLM evaluation, and human feedback.

Result: Providing examples of desired answers effectively improves LLMs' ability to personalize responses for individual learners.

Conclusion: LLMs, when guided with structured examples, can meaningfully contribute to personalizing answers and improving learner engagement in online education.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

TL;DR: This paper explores using a neuromorphic network made of memristive elements for learning and modeling dynamical systems, focusing on optimizing settings for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how neuromorphic networks, as dynamical systems, can effectively learn and model complex dynamical processes using external control parameters.

Method: A memristor-based neuromorphic network was simulated within a reservoir computing framework to predict chaotic time series by tuning input electrodes and voltages.

Result: Optimal performance was achieved when input voltages maximized the memristive components' dynamic range, while increased network coverage reduced undesirable nonlinearities.

Conclusion: Memristor-based neuromorphic networks offer potential for modeling complex systems when optimized via external parameter control, offering insights for practical device implementation.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the capabilities of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and investigates how different hidden unit architectures impact their associative memory and recall, offering theoretical insights and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the memory retrieval and expressive capabilities of RBMs by addressing limitations in their conventional architecture and activation functions.

Method: The authors utilized analytical tools from statistical physics and Monte Carlo simulations to study the impact of hidden unit configurations (e.g., binary, multi-state, ReLU-like activations) on RBMs' thermodynamic behavior and performance.

Result: The study shows RBMs with binary hidden units suffer from reduced critical capacity, but modifications like local biases and richer hidden unit priors can enhance retrieval phases and recall performance.

Conclusion: Hidden unit architecture and activation functions in RBMs significantly influence their capacity and retrieval abilities. Modifications improve both theoretical and practical performance.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feature selection method using thresholding based on minimal depth for Random Forests under double imbalance (class imbalance and dimensional asymmetry). This method yields better variable subset performance than conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods for Random Forests struggle with stability and accuracy in double imbalance conditions (class imbalance and dimensional asymmetry). A robust feature selection mechanism is needed.

Method: A novel thresholding scheme leveraging minimal depth for feature selection is proposed, focusing on assessing variable relevance via tree topology in Random Forests.

Result: Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach delivers more parsimonious and accurate variable subsets compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an interpretable and practical solution for feature selection in Random Forests, effectively addressing the challenges of double imbalance conditions.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: DANCE^2 is an interactive dance performance integrating audience-voted decisions to influence a dancer-robot duet, exploring agency in choreographed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the dynamics of audience agency, particularly, how individuals influence or perceive their power to shape real-time performances and draw analogies to digital systems.

Method: Audience members participated in shaping the wearable robot's actions by voting during live performances. Data from voting patterns and post-performance surveys were analyzed.

Result: While audiences felt their choices had a meaningful impact, the voting data showed consistent decision-making patterns across multiple performances.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a complex interplay between perceived agency, actual behavioral influence, and structural power in interactive environments, mirroring issues in algorithmically curated digital systems.

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI can effectively enhance human creativity and define a framework for its contributions.

Method: The authors adopt a 'distributed creativity' perspective to classify AI's roles into Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis, based on technical autonomy and perceived agency.

Result: The study provides a framework to understand how different configurations of human-AI collaboration impact levels of creativity, from routine tasks to groundbreaking innovations.

Conclusion: The different modes of AI integration have theoretical, ethical, and design implications, paving the way for better human-AI partnerships.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Motivation: Address the increasing need to understand how generative AI technologies influence social interactions amid growing threats to social connectedness and well-being.

Method: A scoping review was conducted, analyzing 30 studies published since 2020 to explore the design, application domains, and evaluation methodologies of GAI-based tools for social interaction.

Result: Key domains for GAI applications include storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. Participatory design approaches and socio-ethical concerns, such as cultural bias, were highlighted.

Conclusion: GAI has significant potential to enhance personalized social interactions, but there is a critical need for equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces three methods to identify critical residues of a protein by leveraging Random Geometric Graphs (RGG) based on molecular dynamics simulations and correlational analysis, comparing results with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying critical residues in proteins is vital because they are essential for protein function, and current methods could benefit from improved specificity and computational efficiency.

Method: The study employs molecular dynamics simulations and learns RGGs, wherein each node represents a protein residue. Criticality is evaluated using three approaches: nodal degree in the RGG (via organic thresholding), posterior probability differences of the graph with and without a residue, and dynamic variations in nodal degrees over time.

Result: The three criticality measures developed in this work are applied to a protein with 156 residues and compared with experimental data, showing varying degrees of agreement across the different methodologies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of RGG-based techniques for identifying critical protein residues, highlighting differences among the three criticality measures and their potential for experimental validation.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Researchers introduced CARE as a standardized benchmark and dataset suite for predicting enzyme functions using ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate machine learning methods that predict enzyme function from sequence.

Method: CARE centers on two tasks: classification of protein sequences by enzyme commission numbers and retrieval of enzyme commission numbers given chemical reactions, with specialized train-test splits for generalization evaluation.

Result: Baselines for classification tasks were established, and a novel method called CREEP was proposed as one of the first baselines for enzyme retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CARE aims to set a standard for evaluating enzyme function prediction methods and proposes innovative approaches for enzyme retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

### [398] [FedMLAC: Mutual Learning Driven Heterogeneous Federated Audio Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10207)
*Jun Bai,Rajib Rana,Di Wu,Youyang Qu,Xiaohui Tao,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Federated Learning for audio classification faces challenges of data and model heterogeneity and data poisoning. FedMLAC introduces a dual-model framework with a globally shared Plug-in model and Layer-wise Pruning Aggregation for robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) struggles with performance issues due to data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and data poisoning in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a unified framework, FedMLAC, integrating dual-model architecture with personalized local and globally shared Plug-in models, using knowledge distillation and Layer-wise Pruning Aggregation.

Result: FedMLAC shows superior classification accuracy and robustness to noisy data across four diverse audio benchmarks, including speech and non-speech tasks.

Conclusion: FedMLAC effectively tackles key challenges in Federated Audio Classification and provides a robust solution for real-world scenarios, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

TL;DR: The paper reviews and benchmarks discrete audio tokenizers across speech, music, and general audio fields, emphasizing the comparison of their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of unified comparison in the growing field of tokenized audio processing and provide systematic insights across multiple domains.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of tokenization methods and evaluate them through benchmarks, analyzing reconstruction quality, downstream task performance, and acoustic language modeling.

Result: Key limitations, trade-offs, and open challenges of audio tokenizers are identified, alongside practical considerations for their use.

Conclusion: The study offers detailed insights and guidance for future research, advancing the understanding of strengths and weaknesses in audio tokenization methods.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to control music generation in detail by manipulating a generative music transformer model, enabling advanced functionalities like timbre and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to enhance fine-grained control in music generation models, overcoming the limitations of global-only conditioning approaches.

Method: The method involves steering residual streams using linear probe weights or attention layer activations during inference, modeled as a regression task to preserve meaningful directional information.

Result: The approach achieved improved music generation performance with versatile control, integrating global and local conditioning capabilities.

Conclusion: This method advances music generation's controllability, enabling timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion with improved precision.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing the interaction between audio encoders and large language models (LLMs) to enhance semantic information transfer using systematic architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve the underlying mechanisms through which audio-LLMs efficiently transfer and use rich semantic audio representations, which has been underexplored despite application advances.

Method: The study systematically modifies a baseline audio-LLM architecture based on hypotheses from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles, using a controlled experimental setup.

Result: The modified architecture achieves 10% to 60% relative improvements over the baseline, showing enhanced ability for cross-modal interaction and information transfer.

Conclusion: Delaying audio integration, focusing on attention mechanisms, and using diverse audio encoders together improve semantic representation transfer in audio-LLMs, providing a more efficient framework for cross-modal systems.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, BNMusic, that blends environmental noises into music generated from user text prompts, reducing noise noticeability and enhancing acoustic experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current acoustic masking techniques often require excessive volume adjustments due to misalignment between dominant masking sounds and environmental noises. This work aims to create an alternative method leveraging cross-modal music generation.

Method: The proposed BNMusic framework has two stages: (1) synthesizing music from noise using mel-spectrogram representations, capturing the essence of the noise, and (2) adaptively amplifying the generated music to minimize noise perception while ensuring auditory quality.

Result: Experiments on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 datasets demonstrate that BNMusic effectively blends environmental noise into rhythmically aligned, amplified, and enjoyable music, reducing noise noticeability and improving acoustic experiences.

Conclusion: This research offers a novel approach to acoustic masking by using personalized, text-prompt-based music generation to make environmental noises less noticeable, improving the auditory environment.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of accurately modeling impacts in systems with unilateral contacts and elastic components, where no universally accepted constitutive law exists.

Method: The paper analyzes and compares rigid-body and soft-contact modeling methods using numerical examples, focusing on the dynamics of unilateral springs in impact systems.

Result: It provides insights into the behavior and parameterization of systems with multiple unilateral contacts and elastic reference elements during impacts.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of impact mechanics by examining modeling approaches and dynamics in systems with unilateral springs and elastic components.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study introduces DUN-SRE, an advanced method for dynamic MRI reconstruction that enforces spatiotemporal rotation symmetry, achieving state-of-the-art results particularly in preserving cardiac motion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI reconstruction quality suffers from challenges under aggressive undersampling. Existing methods only explore spatial symmetry but fail to use temporal symmetry, a critical structural prior for enhanced accuracy.

Method: The authors propose DUN-SRE, a deep unrolling network leveraging a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. It integrates data consistency and proximal mapping within a unified framework to preserve spatiotemporal rotation symmetry in reconstruction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on cardiac CINE MRI datasets show that DUN-SRE outperforms existing methods, offering superior handling of rotation-symmetric structures and better capturing cardiac motion dynamics.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling spatiotemporal rotation equivariance in MRI reconstructions. It sets new performance benchmarks and generalizes well across dynamic MRI tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFF-Net, a novel deep learning method for precise brain tumor segmentation, focusing on contrast-enhancing regions in MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to effectively segment enhancing brain tumor areas due to neglecting MRI-specific features such as complex textures and directional variations.

Method: HFF-Net employs techniques such as Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC), and Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) to segment tumors from frequency-domain characteristics.

Result: HFF-Net improved mean Dice scores across tumor subregions by 4.48% and segmentation accuracy in contrast-enhancing areas by 7.33% across four public datasets.

Conclusion: HFF-Net proves effective in improving brain tumor segmentation accuracy with clinical relevance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, CCELLA, to train latent diffusion models for medical imaging using limited data, improving image synthesis, model performance, and scientific accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in medical latent diffusion model (LDM) training caused by reliance on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical pre-trained models, or large data requirements.

Method: The proposed CCELLA framework utilizes a dual-head conditioning technique that combines large language model-encoded text features and pathology classification data, along with a joint loss function and data-efficient training framework.

Result: CCELLA achieves a superior 3D FID score of 0.025 on prostate MRI data compared to 0.071 from a recent foundation model and improves classifier accuracy for prostate cancer prediction from 69% to 74% using synthetic images.

Conclusion: CCELLA enhances high-quality medical image synthesis despite limited data resources, demonstrating that synthetic images can boost classifier accuracy and perform comparably to real training images.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Oula Puonti,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conditional diffusion model for detecting anomalies and reconstructing healthy tissues in brain MRI scans, which uses synthetic pseudo-pathology images to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in anomaly detection using reconstruction-based methods by addressing their failure to accurately reconstruct healthy and pathological brain MRI regions, particularly in scenarios with limited disease-specific data.

Method: The paper introduces a weakly supervised framework using conditional diffusion models integrated with synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images. These are created by a fluid-driven anomaly randomization technique applied on real pathology maps.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms variational autoencoders, and both conditional and unconditional latent diffusion methods. It also exceeds most supervised inpainting methods when detecting pathology on various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully advances unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI by improving model reconstruction and pathology detection, without requiring extensive diseased subject data.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWDL-Net, a semi-supervised learning framework that integrates Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling to improve segmentation in medical imaging, particularly for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of obtaining large, manually annotated datasets for intracranial hemorrhage segmentation, which is tedious and expensive.

Method: The paper proposes SWDL-Net, which leverages a Laplacian pyramid for edge sharpening and deep convolutional upsampling for detailed feature mapping. The approach combines these mechanisms using a difference learning framework for superior segmentation accuracy.

Result: SWDL-Net demonstrated superior segmentation performance on both a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks with only 2% labeled data, as well as high efficacy on the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net is a highly effective semi-supervised learning framework for ICH segmentation in medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art performance under limited labeled data conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been

### [409] [ConStyX: Content Style Augmentation for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10675)
*Xi Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Peng Cao,Jinzhu Yang,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConStyX, a domain generalization method to improve medical image segmentation across multiple domains, addressing limitations in current domain randomization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in medical images impair segmentation model performance, necessitating robust approaches for better generalization.

Method: ConStyX augments both content and style in training data while controlling over-augmentation effects to enhance model generalizability.

Result: Experiments validated that ConStyX performs better than existing methods in handling domain generalization for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: ConStyX is a promising domain generalization method for medical image segmentation, improving robustness against domain shifts.

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.
The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy
artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future

### [411] [Med-URWKV: Pure RWKV With ImageNet Pre-training For Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10858)
*Zhenhuan Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-URWKV, a pure RWKV-based segmentation model using a pre-trained encoder, achieving competitive results in medical image segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing CNN and Transformer-based methods and explore the potential of pre-trained RWKV models for medical segmentation.

Method: Developed Med-URWKV architecture based on U-Net, leveraging ImageNet-pretrained VRWKV encoder for enhanced performance.

Result: Med-URWKV showed comparable or superior results across seven datasets compared to RWKV models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: Pretraining and reusing a VRWKV encoder can significantly improve medical image segmentation performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

### [412] [Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916)
*Meredith VandeHaar,M. Clinch,I. Yilmaz,M. A. Rahman,Y. Xiao,F. Dogany,H. M. Alazab,A. Nassar,Z. Akkus,B. Dangott*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses quality assurance gaps in digital pathology, where artifacts affect AI models' performance, proposing an AI tool to detect and localize artifacts accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality assurance in digital pathology is critical but often overlooked, and artifacts can significantly degrade the accuracy of pathology AI diagnostic models.

Method: The researchers propose an AI algorithm that categorizes tiles into artifact types using pre-defined annotations, performing detection and localization via InceptionResNet models.

Result: The study identified optimal models for detecting artifacts, combining single artifact binary models and limited multiple instance models to enhance performance.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach leveraging single and multiple instance models is recommended for effective artifact detection, reducing manual review time and resource consumption.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

### [413] [SNR and Resource Adaptive Deep JSCC for Distributed IoT Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10699)
*Ali Waqas,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive CNN framework optimized for wireless image classification in IoT, improving both accuracy and resource allocation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for IoT image classification often use static configurations for processing, which fail to adapt to varying computational limitations and wireless channel conditions.

Method: A learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) is proposed to optimize distributed CNN configurations based on SNR and computational resource constraints. It uses Random Forests for smart exploration of hyperparameter space.

Result: The framework improves classification accuracy by 10% at low SNR (-10dB) compared to existing methods and adapts to computational budgets ranging from 1M to 70M FLOPs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is highly effective in enhancing IoT device adaptability and performance under challenging conditions, outperforming static and less flexible architectures.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

### [414] [Prediction of steady states in a marine ecosystem model by a machine learning technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10475)
*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to accelerate the spin-up process in global marine ecosystem models by using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to predict steady states, significantly reducing computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spin-up processes in marine ecosystem models are computationally expensive, requiring numerous iterations to converge to a steady state. This inefficiency creates a need for innovative approaches to reduce the time and computational cost associated with obtaining steady-state solutions.

Method: The authors used a precomputed set of steady states as training data to build a mapping between biogeochemical parameters and steady states via a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. They utilized the CVAE-predicted output as an initial value for the spin-up process to reduce iteration counts, comparing it to the use of uniform, constant initial values and the mean of the training data.

Result: Using the CVAE-predicted steady states as initial conditions significantly reduced the number of iterations required for the spin-up process by 50-95%, depending on the stopping criterion used. In comparison, using the mean of the training data also accelerated the spin-up but was far less efficient.

Conclusion: The CVAE approach presents a promising technique to substantially reduce computational costs in marine ecosystem models while achieving steady states efficiently. However, the predictions require additional refinement to fully match the periodicity of traditional spin-up solutions.

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

*Tim Whittaker,Alejandro Di Luca*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to simulate worst-case heatwave scenarios, surpassing existing models in efficiency and scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and fidelity challenges in estimating upper bounds of extreme weather events using traditional methods.

Method: The authors developed NeuralGCM, a framework leveraging differentiable climate modeling to optimize initial conditions and simulate heatwave trajectories.

Result: NeuralGCM generated temperature anomalies up to 3.7°C higher than the most extreme model in a 75-member ensemble for the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave.

Conclusion: Differentiable hybrid climate models can efficiently explore extreme weather patterns, enabling better risk assessments and storyline construction in a warming climate.

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

*Simon Lang,Martin Leutbecher,Pedro Maciel*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses implementing a multi-scale loss formulation to improve probabilistic weather forecasting models, specifically AIFS-CRPS developed by ECMWF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance weather forecasting systems by overcoming challenges in capturing multi-scale variability without degrading performance.

Method: Incorporate multi-scale loss into the training process of the AIFS-CRPS model, optimizing using the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS).

Result: The multi-scale loss improves constraints on small-scale variability while maintaining forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: The innovative training approach demonstrates potential for further advances in scale-aware weather model training methods.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

### [417] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FastFLUX is proposed to improve inference speed and efficiency of text-to-image generation models like FLUX using structural pruning and localized fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation models, such as FLUX, suffer from slow inference and high memory usage due to their large parameter sizes.

Method: The paper introduces FastFLUX employing BRLL to prune complex residual blocks in the model and ST to localized fine-tuning for preserving performance.

Result: FastFLUX retains high-quality image generation while significantly increasing inference speed and reducing the model's complexity by pruning 20% of the hierarchy.

Conclusion: FastFLUX offers a novel solution to accelerate T2I models while maintaining quality, improving deployability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

### [418] [Ambient Diffusion Omni: Training Good Models with Bad Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10038)
*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Ambient Diffusion Omni, which leverages low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to enhance diffusion model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models often discard low-quality images, focusing only on curated datasets; the authors aim to utilize these discarded images effectively.

Method: The framework uses properties of natural images (spectral power law decay and locality) and analyzes the trade-off between biased and limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Result: State-of-the-art ImageNet FID and notable improvements in image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling were achieved.

Conclusion: Low-quality images can greatly enhance diffusion model training, challenging the current reliance on curated datasets with theoretical support for their approach.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

### [419] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for density-equalizing mapping (DEM), addressing the limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional density-equalizing mapping methods face challenges like limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts, and difficulties in extending from 2D to 3D.

Method: The authors propose a learning-based framework (LDEM) using neural networks, introducing a loss function for density uniformity and geometrical regularity, coupled with a hierarchical prediction approach.

Result: The method achieves superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties, is applicable to surface remeshing, and transitions easily between 2D and 3D domains.

Conclusion: The proposed LDEM framework offers scalable, robust computation for density-equalizing maps, enabling diverse practical applications.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a practical and cost-effective virtual try-on approach using real human body data, improving garment alignment and usability for purchasing decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing virtual try-on systems (e.g., high cost, robotic mannequins, and misaligned garments) and create a more accurate and accessible solution.

Method: The method involves a per-garment dataset collection using real humans, a hybrid person representation employing a simplified DensePose map, and evaluation using qualitative, quantitative, and user study techniques.

Result: The proposed method showed superior image quality and temporal consistency compared to existing techniques and received positive feedback regarding its utility in garment purchasing decisions.

Conclusion: This approach eliminates the need for expensive mannequins, improves garment alignment, and provides a helpful solution for virtual try-on applications, with implications for broader adoption.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

*Junchao Huang,Xinting Hu,Zhuotao Tian,Shaoshuai Shi,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Edit360 is a framework leveraging video diffusion models to enable consistent 3D editing across all viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving fine-grained, multi-view consistent editing for 3D assets, which is limited in current methods.

Method: Edit360 employs video diffusion models with an Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism to synchronize edits across 360-degree views.

Result: The framework successfully propagates edits to generate coherent multi-view sequences, supporting seamless 3D asset reconstruction.

Conclusion: Edit360 enhances flexible and practical 3D content creation by ensuring structural coherence and user-specific editing across arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

### [422] [Transformer IMU Calibrator: Dynamic On-body IMU Calibration for Inertial Motion Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10580)
*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The authors present a dynamic calibration method for inertial motion capture systems that eliminates the traditional static assumption, enabling real-time estimation of calibration matrices during motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of traditional static calibration methods for inertial motion capture systems, particularly the inability to adapt to dynamic conditions or long-term usage.

Method: A Transformer-based model was developed to learn the mapping of calibration matrices and IMU readings using synthetic datasets, alongside a calibration trigger that ensures diverse IMU data for accurate real-time estimation.

Result: The method achieves real-time calibration without requiring explicit calibration processes and enables prolonged accurate motion capture with sparse IMU setups.

Conclusion: This novel approach expands the usability of inertial motion capture systems by breaking static assumptions and introducing dynamic, real-time calibration, marking a significant step in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: This paper generalizes the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence to Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, presenting a closed form for equivalent measures and introducing a regularized version for unrestricted cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the utility of the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence from finite-dimensional spaces to Gaussian measures in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, addressing theoretical and practical gaps in its application.

Method: The authors derive a closed-form expression for the divergence among Gaussian measures equivalent to a fixed one, and utilize the concept of Log-Determinant divergences to define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence for broader applicability.

Result: A generalization of the divergence to infinite-dimensional settings is provided, along with a regularized variant that converges to the exact divergence in specific cases.

Conclusion: The research succeeds in broadening the scope of the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence to infinite-dimensional spaces while maintaining mathematical rigor and practical utility through regularization.

Abstract: This work studies the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, based on the
notion of geometric mean of probability measures, in the setting of Gaussian
measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. On the set of all Gaussian
measures equivalent to a fixed one, we present a closed form expression for
this divergence that directly generalizes the finite-dimensional version. Using
the notion of Log-Determinant divergences between positive definite unitized
trace class operators, we then define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon
divergence that is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and that recovers
the exact Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence between two equivalent Gaussian
measures when the regularization parameter tends to zero.

TL;DR: The paper presents deterministic CONGEST algorithms for the Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem with tight complexity analysis in trees and improved approximation results for graphs with bounded arboricity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computing approximate solutions for the Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem efficiently in distributed settings, especially for trees and sparse graphs characterized by bounded arboricity.

Method: The authors devised deterministic CONGEST algorithms with optimized complexity. They provide tight bounds for trees, leveraging local rounding frameworks and introducing novel methods to achieve improved approximations for graphs of bounded arboricity.

Result: For trees, the paper establishes a tight complexity bound of Θ(log*(n)/ε) for (1-ε)-approximations. For bounded arboricity graphs, it achieves weight approximations of at least (1-ε)w(V)/(4β) and (1-ε)w(V)/(2β+1) in optimized computation rounds, improving prior known results.

Conclusion: The paper advances the state of deterministic distributed algorithms for MWIS in sparse graphs by providing tight bounds for trees and better approximation guarantees for bounded arboricity graphs.

Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classic optimization problem that
has also been studied quite intensively in the distributed setting. While the
problem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation
algorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider
deterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the
problem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.
  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set
(MWIS) problem has a tight $\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$ complexity. The lower
bound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we
show that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.
  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the
sum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, an
independent set of weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$ can
be computed in $O(\log^2(\beta/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$ rounds. This
result is obtained by a direct application of the local rounding framework of
Faour, Ghaffari, Grunau, Kuhn, and Rozho\v{n} [SODA '23]. We further show that
for any $\epsilon>0$, an independent set of weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$ can be computed in
$O(\log^3(\beta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2 \cdot\log n)$ rounds. This
improves on a recent result of Gil [OPODIS '23], who showed that a
$1/\lfloor(2+\epsilon)\beta\rfloor$-approximation to the MWIS problem can be
computed in $O(\beta\cdot\log n)$ rounds. As an intermediate step, we design an
algorithm to compute an independent set of total weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\sum_{v\in V}\frac{w(v)}{deg(v)+1}$ in time
$O(\log^3(\Delta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$, where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph.

### [425] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper explores the effect of data quantity versus channel count on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) quality in EEG processing, using AMICA-based evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the quantity of EEG data and the number of channels influence the quality of ICA decomposition, particularly in settings with varying data availability.

Method: The study used AMICA decompositions on a 71-channel dataset with 13 subjects, varying the data-to-channel frame ratio through random subsampling. Quality was assessed using mutual information reduction (MIR) and near dipolarity of components.

Result: Results revealed an asymptotic increase in MIR and a general increase in near dipolarity with more data, but no clear threshold or plateau in quality improvement was identified.

Conclusion: Collecting additional EEG data beyond conventional thresholds likely enhances ICA decomposition quality, indicating value in exceeding typical data collection heuristics.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework to improve ground reaction force (GRF) estimation from wearable insole sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable insole sensors offer portability and cost-efficiency for GRF measurement but suffer from noise and accuracy issues compared to treadmill-based measurements.

Method: The proposed framework enhances GRF estimation by leveraging similarity and temporal features during the knowledge distillation process, focusing on mini-batch relationships.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed existing baselines in accurately estimating GRF using wearable sensors.

Conclusion: Time-aware Knowledge Distillation improves the utility of wearable insole sensors for GRF measurement, making them more practical for healthcare and diagnostics applications.

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

### [427] [AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540)
*Haoyuan Shi,Yunxin Li,Xinyu Chen,Longyue Wang,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AniMaker is a framework that generates story-consistent and visually coherent animations from text input by using a multi-agent architecture and innovative techniques like MCTS-Gen and AniEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models face challenges in maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency across multi-scene animations.

Method: AniMaker employs a multi-agent framework featuring roles such as Director, Photography, Reviewer, and Post-Production agents, with MCTS-Gen optimizing clip generation and AniEval for multi-shot animation evaluation.

Result: Experiments show AniMaker outperforms others in both quality and efficiency, achieving metrics like VBench and AniEval while making progress toward production-level animation standards.

Conclusion: AniMaker demonstrates the capability of achieving storytelling animations with improved coherence and efficiency, offering significant advancements in AI-based video production.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Abstract: Sandboxing restricts what applications do, and prevents exploited processes
being abused; yet relatively few applications get sandboxed: why? We report a
usability trial with 7 experienced Seccomp developers exploring how they

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the limitations of padding in conventional products and CNN designs, seeking a method that avoids introducing junk information while leveraging STP.

Conclusion: The integration of domain-based CP with STP demonstrates a promising approach to CNN design and its applications, avoiding padding-related issues.

### [430] [Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10251)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm to optimize camera placement in eye-to-hand configurations for visual servoing applications by minimizing image noise while conserving movement energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus heavily on control and observation architectures but largely overlook the impact of camera positioning on image accuracy in manufacturing environments.

Method: Proposed a camera movement algorithm that learns environmental conditions to find optimal locations for minimizing image noise, ensuring suboptimal location selection when energy constraints are considered.

Result: Simulations confirmed the algorithm's ability to improve observation precision while requiring limited energy for camera movements.

Conclusion: The technique enhances image accuracy in manufacturing tasks by efficiently locating ideal camera positions without significant energy usage.

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

*Souvik Ghosh,Sayak Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper investigates generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models exploring the effects of quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving using computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how the SSH model—a canonical 1D topological insulator—behaves under realistic, complex physical conditions.

Method: The study employs computational techniques like exact diagonalization, numerical solvers, and unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to map out phase spaces and characterize localization and topology in the system.

Result: The study finds that edge states in the SSH model are destroyed by strong Aubry-André-Harper modulation and that non-Hermitian systems exhibit the non-Hermitian skin effect. Floquet driving can induce topological phenomena, such as Floquet topological insulators, even in trivial chains.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generalized 1D topological systems host a variety of phenomena, with implications for understanding and engineering topological edge-state behavior in more complex systems.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study uses advanced simulation techniques to understand the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in solid-state batteries, revealing a new phase and mechanisms critical to battery performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limitations in simulation methods motivated the authors to explore SEI formation mechanisms at an atomistic level with higher accuracy.

Method: The authors conducted large-scale reactive simulations using a combination of active learning, deep equivariant neural network potentials, and unsupervised clustering techniques to model and analyze the SEI formation.

Result: The study identified a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase (Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$) in the SEI, which was not predicted by thermodynamic models and explained critical Li creep mechanisms at the interface.

Conclusion: This research provides a digitally accurate twin of SEI formation processes, offering new insights into atomistic dynamics that govern complex reactions in solid-state batteries, without relying on experimental fitting parameters.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCCL, a method for improving matrix completion in recommender systems using contrastive learning, achieving higher accuracy and ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural network methods for matrix completion are sensitive to noisy edges and prone to overfitting, which limits their effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: The proposed MCCL method uses local neighborhood subgraphs to generate two graph representations: one focusing on denoising with attention-enhanced GNN layers and the other using a graph variational autoencoder to align the feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function harmonizes the two representations during training.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 0.8% improvement in RMSE and up to 36% improvement in ranking metrics, indicating better numerical accuracy and ranking performance.

Conclusion: The MCCL method effectively addresses challenges in matrix completion by denoising and enhancing generalizability, leading to significant improvements in both accuracy and ranking outcomes.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Varsha Ramineni,Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability and biases in synthetic test collections constructed with LLMs for evaluating IR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating diverse queries and obtaining costly relevance judgments for evaluating IR systems, exploring synthetic test collections as a potential solution.

Method: The authors use LLMs to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both, and analyze potential biases in evaluation results using empirical studies and a linear mixed-effects model.

Result: The study demonstrates the presence of biases in evaluation results from synthetic test collections and shows that while biases affect absolute system performance metrics, their impact on relative system performance comparisons is lesser.

Conclusion: Synthetic test collections may be less reliable for computing absolute system performance due to biases but may still be suitable for comparing relative system performance. Further analysis is suggested for validation.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightKG simplifies GNN design and integrates efficient SSL to solve sparsity issues, achieving superior recommendation accuracy and reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in GNN-based KGRSs and improve performance under sparse interactions by simplifying methodologies and SSL implementation.

Method: Introduced LightKG, which uses simplified GNN layers encoding directed relations as scalar pairs, linear aggregation, and efficient contrastive SSL avoiding subgraph comparisons.

Result: LightKG achieves a 5.8% improvement in recommendation accuracy and reduces training time by 84.3% compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LightKG method is more effective and efficient than complex GNNs in both sparse and dense scenarios, addressing performance issues and training inefficiencies inherent in existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

### [439] [SHORE: A Long-term User Lifetime Value Prediction Model in Digital Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10487)
*Shuaiqi Sun,Congde Yuan,Haoqiang Yang,Mengzhuo Guo,Guiying Wei,Jiangbo Tian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHORE, a framework for predicting long-term user lifetime value (LTV) in digital gaming, addressing challenges like delayed payments and outlier behavior. Experimentation shows SHORE substantially improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for long-term LTV prediction in gaming struggle due to challenges like sparse initial data, delayed payments, and high-value outliers, leading to underperformance and poor robustness.

Method: SHORE combines short-horizon LTV predictions as auxiliary tasks with a hybrid loss function (order-preserving classification and dynamic Huber loss) to better predict long-term LTV while addressing zero-inflation and outlier influences.

Result: SHORE demonstrated a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error during online deployments and outperformed competing models in offline and online experiments with real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The SHORE framework is effective and robust for industrial-scale LTV prediction in digital gaming, offering superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

### [440] [Macro Graph of Experts for Billion-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10520)
*Hongyu Yao,Zijin Hong,Hao Chen,Yuanchen Bei,Zhiqing Li,Qijie Shen,Zuobin Ying,Huan Gong,Feiran Huang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper presents the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE), a novel multi-task learning framework that leverages macro graph embeddings for billion-scale recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of multi-task learning on distinct billion-scale graphs, where traditional methods fail to incorporate graph structures, missing a significant opportunity for performance improvement.

Method: The method proposed is the MGOE framework, introducing a Macro Graph Bottom to capture task-specific macro features and a Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks.

Result: MGOE outperforms state-of-the-art models in experiments with three public datasets and achieves superior results in billion-scale recommender system deployments through online A/B tests.

Conclusion: The MGOE framework is a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation, demonstrating significant performance advantages in both experimental and real-world settings.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

### [441] [Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10859)
*Kehan Long,Shasha Li,Chen Xu,Jintao Tang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced pointwise ranking approach using a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise (GCCP) strategy for document ranking, combining efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pointwise ranking methods for document scoring by addressing their lack of global comparative insights, leading to suboptimal performance compared to computationally expensive comparative approaches.

Method: Introduces GCCP, which uses a query-specific anchor document summarizing pseudo-relevant candidates for global reference comparisons, and seamlessly integrates this with the Post-Aggregated Global Context (PAGC) approach.

Result: Experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks show significant improvements over previous pointwise methods in effectiveness with comparable efficiency, and competitive performance against resource-intensive comparative approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed GCCP and PAGC approaches enhance pointwise ranking by addressing its comparative limitations, delivering state-of-the-art performance with high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

### [442] [Diffusion prior as a direct regularization term for FWI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10141)
*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that uses pretrained diffusion models to improve Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) by avoiding noisy intermediate states and operating entirely in clean image space, offering greater stability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The instability and numerical artifacts caused by noisy intermediate states in applying diffusion models to physics-constrained scenarios like Full Waveform Inversion (FWI).

Method: A pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is integrated into FWI using a score rematching strategy, entirely avoiding reverse diffusion sampling and operating in clean image space.

Result: The proposed method improves fidelity, robustness, and convergence behavior, outperforming conventional and GAN-based FWI methods, all while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The framework enables stable wave propagation and improves the inversion quality of FWI with minimal changes to existing pipelines, demonstrating practicality for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

*Oleg Berngardt,Ivan Lavygin*

TL;DR: The paper develops an automatic classifier based on radar data and ionospheric radio wave propagation modeling, trained on data from 12 radars over two years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of ionospheric radar data for understanding physical mechanisms related to solar and geomagnetic activity.

Method: Radar data and ionospheric modeling are combined, resulting in a classifier using 2669 coefficients. Calibration was performed using meteor trail signals.

Result: Optimal classification achieved with 37 data classes, identifying 14 confidently separated subsets with meaningful physical interpretations for ten classes.

Conclusion: Key parameters for identifying classes include signal ray-tracing shape, scattering height, and Doppler velocity, aligning with known physical mechanisms.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel audio comprehension model utilizing dialogue continuation instead of direct caption generation to enhance instruction-following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the caption variation problem and enhance the ability to extract meaningful instructions from audio data.

Method: The proposed model uses dialogue continuation training, where it generates responses as though the input caption starts a conversation, instead of directly simulating captions during training.

Result: The model achieves zero-shot instruction-following capabilities and successfully performs on unseen instructions using datasets like AudioCaps, WavCaps, Clotho, and AudioBench.

Conclusion: Dialogue continuation mitigates caption variation issues and equips the model with enhanced comprehension and instruction-following skills without requiring multitask instruction tuning.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve speech recognizer adaptation to minimal data using a novel loss function and speaker characterization, achieving significant reductions in word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting speech recognizers to new speakers or conditions typically requires substantial labeled data. This paper addresses the challenge of adapting robustly with minimal, often unlabeled, data.

Method: The method utilizes conditional entropy on multiple hypotheses for robust adaptation and a compact 'speaker code' to characterize speakers with limited data.

Result: Evaluation on a far-field noise-augmented Common Voice dataset shows a 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of adaptation data, rising to 29% with 10 minutes.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective speech recognizer adaptation in constrained data scenarios, demonstrating significant gains in performance.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

### [447] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to automate intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) replanning for head-and-neck cancer, achieving superior performance compared to manual replanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing caused by anatomical changes during IMPT and to reduce the resource-intensive nature of manual treatment replanning.

Method: The study uses deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train personalized agents for each patient based on their anatomy. The agents optimize treatment plans using a reward mechanism derived from a multi-point plan quality score.

Result: Both DRL agents improved treatment plan scores significantly (DQN: 139.78, PPO: 142.74), performing better than manual replans (score: 137.20). This improvement was validated clinically in terms of better tumor coverage and organ-at-risk sparing.

Conclusion: The DRL framework provides an efficient solution for adaptive proton therapy, showing potential to replace conventional manual replanning with automated, patient-specific approaches that adapt to anatomical changes effectively.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

TL;DR: The study introduces MAGIC, a deep learning model for multi-modal, cardiac substructure segmentation across CT and MR scans, achieving promising efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizability in cardiac substructure segmentation across different imaging modalities, minimizing the risk of radiation-induced heart disease.

Method: A U-shaped nnU-Net-based model with replicated encoding-decoding branches to handle multi-modal segmentation; trained and tested on data from multiple modalities including Sim-CT, MR-Linac, and CCTA.

Result: MAGIC achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients of 0.75 (Sim-CT), 0.68 (MR-Linac), and 0.80 (CCTA) and outperformed other models in 57% of cases with minimal statistical differences.

Conclusion: MAGIC proved to be an effective, modality-agnostic, lightweight solution for cardiac substructure segmentation, simplifying clinical implementation and enhancing flexibility.

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The abstract presents an encoding of Levy's call-by-push-value lambda-calculus (CBPV) into the pi-calculus, demonstrates its soundness and completeness, and partially formalizes these proofs using Coq.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a connection between CBPV and the pi-calculus through encoding and to address challenges such as de Bruijn indices and bisimulation consistency.

Method: The paper informalizes proofs for soundness, completeness, and encoding consistency, applies the pi-i-calculus specialization to simplify bisimulation challenges, and begins partial Coq formalization.

Result: Results include sound and complete CBPV encoding in the pi-calculus, alignment with Gorla's criteria for good encodings, and partial formalization in Coq.

Conclusion: The paper successfully encodes CBPV in various forms of pi-calculus, aligns with encoding criteria, and highlights challenges tied to Coq formalization while claiming its practicality through informal proofs.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: StepProof introduces sentence-level autoformalization for verifying mathematical proofs in interactive theorem provers using large language models, improving verification granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive theorem provers lack natural language interfaces and existing autoformalization methods are limited to verifying only complete proofs.

Method: StepProof decomposes complete proofs into verifiable subproofs, enabling step-by-step and sentence-level verification.

Result: Experimental evidence shows StepProof improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to standard autoformalization methods. Manually tailored proofs enhance performance further.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that StepProof's step-level granularity boosts the effectiveness of autoformalization, addressing limitations of existing methods in fine-grained proof verification.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

TL;DR: This paper explores strategy-proof mechanisms for facility location, addressing equitability via the Gini index, complemented Gini index, and Nash welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance equitability among agents in facility location problems using strategy-proof mechanisms.

Method: They prove a foundational impossibility result concerning the Gini index, then propose using complemented Gini index and Nash welfare as alternative measures of equitability. The paper analyzes deterministic and randomized mechanisms.

Result: No mechanism can achieve bounded approximation ratios for the optimal Gini index. Complemented Gini index-based mechanisms and Nash welfare approximations offer alternative insights.

Conclusion: Enhanced measures such as complemented Gini index and Nash welfare serve as viable tools for analyzing equitability in strategy-proof facility location mechanisms.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

TL;DR: This pilot study explores the use of humanoid robots in Action Observation (AO) therapy for rehabilitation by monitoring brain activity using EEG. Results show variability in neural responses and potential feasibility for robotic AO therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether humanoid robots can effectively support Action Observation (AO) therapy, a rehabilitative approach for neurological recovery, by analyzing differences in brain activity during human- and robot-induced action observation.

Method: EEG monitored the brain activity of three healthy participants during observation of eight actions performed by a human and a humanoid robot. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed to study neural oscillation changes.

Result: The study revealed variability in ERSP patterns across participants, with one showing stronger responses to robot-induced actions, as well as positive correlations in ERSP for most participants, suggesting common neural processes in the mirror neuron system.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using EEG to examine neural responses to both human- and robot-induced actions, supporting the potential integration of robots in AO therapy for rehabilitation.

Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for
motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological
conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential
of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain
activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with
electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions
performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right
arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the
spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus,
compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject
analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including
power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed
stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong
and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for
almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or
neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results
support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses
to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.

*Olga Ovcharenko,Florian Barkmann,Philip Toma,Imant Daunhawer,Julia Vogt,Sebastian Schelter,Valentina Boeva*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces scSSL-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating SSL methods on single-cell data, revealing task-specific trade-offs and the need for specialized multi-modal frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to better understand how self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can extract meaningful biological insights from single-cell data.

Method: It evaluates nineteen SSL methods across nine datasets on batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction, while analyzing various data augmentation strategies.

Result: Specialized frameworks like scVI and scGPT perform well in uni-modal tasks, while generic SSL methods like VICReg excel in multi-modal tasks. Random masking is identified as the best augmentation technique.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench serves as a standardized evaluation platform for SSL in single-cell genomics, supporting the development of better frameworks and providing practical guidelines.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

*Shiyu Jiang,Xuyin Liu,Zitong Jerry Wang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study evaluates genomic language models (gLMs) in predicting loss-of-function mutations, emphasizing the roles of sequence likelihood and length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether genomic language models can accurately predict sequence-to-function relationships, particularly in identifying mutation impacts for synthetic biology advancements.

Method: The study introduces a novel prediction task called Nullsettes to assess gLMs' performance in identifying key mutation effects. It evaluates 12 state-of-the-art models based on their predictions and investigates the link between sequence likelihood and prediction performance.

Result: Prediction performance strongly correlates with model predictions for the non-mutated sequence, and sequence length significantly influences the model's predictive power and accuracy.

Conclusion: Both sequence likelihood and length are critical to the effective use of gLMs for mutation effect predictions, showing their potential but also their limitations for synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for identifying homogeneous subgroups in large datasets, with a clinical application in analyzing breast cancer data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for methods to identify coherent subgroups within heterogeneous datasets, particularly in healthcare, to gain deeper insights into complex diseases.

Method: The authors design an algorithm using a rounding technique to approximate the optimal solution of a classification problem within 0.82 accuracy.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies homogeneous patient subcohorts in breast cancer RNA data, revealing patterns related to methylation and nuclear receptor expression.

Conclusion: The proposed method can help uncover pathways and targeted treatments for specific subgroups, showing potential for broader applications in personalized medicine.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest leverages AI-driven automation to address challenges in testing O-RAN components, significantly reducing test time and ensuring compliance with specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a scalable, efficient, and error-resistant testing framework for O-RAN systems, given the challenges of disaggregated architectures and manual testing approaches.

Method: AI5GTest uses a Large Language Model framework (Gen-LLM for test case generation, Val-LLM for compliance validation, Debug-LLM for debugging) and a human-in-the-loop mechanism to automate and validate O-RAN testing.

Result: The framework reduced test execution time significantly while retaining high validation accuracy, demonstrating its operational efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: AI5GTest bridges gaps in current O-RAN testing methods, offering a scalable and accurate solution powered by AI with manual oversight for transparency.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

*Eduardo Baena,Paolo Testolina,Michele Polese,Sergi Aliaga,Andrew Benincasa,Dimitrios Koutsonikolas,Josep Jornet,Tommaso Melodia*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension to Space-O-RAN using semantic agentic layers to enhance wireless communication systems for lunar surface operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current space communication systems lack dynamic adaptability and semantic integration, limiting their efficiency in demanding lunar environments.

Method: The method involves the use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication to enable distributed cognitive agents that manage context-aware decisions.

Result: The proposed framework enables improvements such as delay-adaptive reasoning, bandwidth-aware compression, and coordinated strategies across lunar communication systems.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic agents with Space-O-RAN achieves better autonomy, disruption robustness, and adaptability for lunar mission wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model for energy-efficient traffic classification on microcontrollers, optimized for high accuracy, computational efficiency, and deployability in IoT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of balancing accuracy and efficiency in traffic classification for IoT devices with limited computational resources.

Method: A 1D-CNN model optimized through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), quantized for INT8 deployment to maintain efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.

Result: The model achieves up to 96.59% accuracy on datasets, generalizes across tasks with 94%-99% accuracy, and is deployed on microcontrollers with low inference latency and energy consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of low-power, real-time traffic analysis on IoT devices, enabling scalable security solutions for encrypted traffic.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

### [459] [Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10153)
*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based RL framework for aerodynamic lift control in gusts, leveraging pretraining and transfer learning to outperform linear control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of linear flow control strategies in handling strong and sequential disturbances in aerodynamic settings, and to enhance control performance despite partial observability.

Method: A transformer-based reinforcement learning framework is developed, utilizing pretraining with expert policies and task-level transfer learning to regulate aerodynamic lift via pitch control, supported by surface pressure sensor data.

Result: The framework surpasses proportional control strategies, generalizes effectively to environments with longer gust sequences, and highlights the benefits of quarter-chord pitching control for lift regulation with less effort.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance, generalizability across configurations, and potential applicability to challenging flow control problems with computational acceleration techniques.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids is a framework combining physics pre-training, operator distillation, and fine-tuning for efficient and accurate fluid simulation with limited data, showing significant speedups and accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-fidelity, efficient fluid dynamics simulations in scientific and engineering applications faces challenges with the high computational costs of traditional methods and limitations of existing AI-driven approaches.

Method: OmniFluids incorporates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning into its framework. The architecture includes a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers for effective and scalable physical modeling.

Result: OmniFluids demonstrates superior performance in both 2D and 3D benchmarks by achieving high accuracy in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics, delivering 10-100x computation speedups, and recovering physical parameters from noisy, sparse data.

Conclusion: The work presents OmniFluids as an effective conceptual shift in surrogate modeling for complex fluid systems, emphasizing its ability to work under limited data and providing generalizable, efficient, and accurate modeling solutions.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

### [461] [Synchronization for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10258)
*Satvik Maurya,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses desynchronization issues in quantum error correction (QEC) codes and introduces three synchronization policies (Passive, Active, Hybrid) to mitigate logical error rates and improve decoding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Desynchronization in syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits limits the effectiveness of quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing, increasing risks of uncorrectable errors.

Method: The authors propose and analyze three synchronization policies – Passive (idling until synchronization), Active (gradual slowing via short idle periods), and Hybrid (combination of Active with extra error correction cycles) – to reduce logical error rates and improve performance.

Result: The Active policy achieves up to 2.4x reduction in logical error rates, while the Hybrid policy achieves up to 3.4x reduction. The proposed methods also enable a speedup in decoding latency by up to 2.2x under a circuit-level noise model.

Conclusion: Synchronization policies significantly enhance logical error rates and decoding latency, aiding the resilience and efficiency of quantum error correction codes in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical
qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface
code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate
for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the
surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,
thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the
production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the
use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.
Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits
involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow
down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,
thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define
three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the
baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they
are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the
Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by
inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces
the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The
Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the
synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.
Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed
synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x
with a circuit-level noise model.

Method: The paper integrates quantum circuits to generate dynamic parameters for classical MLPs, leveraging amplitude encoding and parameterized quantum operations. It employs statistical learning theory and Neural Tangent Kernel analysis for theoretical guarantees in representation and optimization.

Result: Empirical validation through experiments on quantum-dot charge state classification and transcription factor binding site prediction shows resilient performance under realistic quantum noise simulations. Theoretical analysis indicates exponential improvements in representation with increased quantum circuit depth and qubits.

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet is a scalable, robust quantum-classical architecture, providing computational advantages and enabling practical quantum-enhanced learning in the current noisy quantum computing paradigm.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.
