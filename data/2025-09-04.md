### [1] [Can Media Act as a Soft Regulator of Safe AI Development? A Game Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02650)
*Henrique Correia da Fonseca,António Fernandes,Zhao Song,Theodor Cimpeanu,Nataliya Balabanova,Adeela Bashir,Paolo Bova,Alessio Buscemi,Alessandro Di Stefano,Manh Hong Duong,Elias Fernandez Domingos,Ndidi Bianca Ogbo,Simon T. Powers,Daniele Proverbio,Zia Ush Shamszaman,Fernando P. Santos,The Anh Han,Marcus Krellner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores media's role in promoting user safety in AI products, using evolutionary game theory to study cooperation between AI creators and users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether media can influence AI developers to prioritize user safety over profit through reputation management.

Method: The authors used evolutionary game theory to simulate interactions between AI creators and users in artificial populations.

Result: The results show that media can foster cooperation for safety, but only if information is reliable and costs aren’t prohibitive.

Conclusion: Media, by shaping public perception, can act as a soft regulator that promotes AI safety even without formal government oversight.

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

TL;DR: This paper outlines a strategy to strengthen the link between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS) for mutual progress and scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interconnection between AI and MPS makes it imperative to optimize the synergy for advancing scientific research and influencing AI development.

Method: The paper proposes strategic priorities and activities across three key areas: facilitating two-way AI+MPS research, fostering interdisciplinary researcher communities, and advancing education and workforce development in AI within the MPS domain.

Result: A set of recommended priorities was provided to guide funding agencies, educational institutions, and researchers toward establishing MPS as a leader in leveraging AI's transformative capabilities.

Conclusion: Proactively bridging AI and MPS can accelerate scientific discovery, influence AI advancements, and position MPS as a leader in this interdisciplinary research field.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of
AI+MPS.

### [3] [Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722)
*Delong Chen,Theo Moutakanni,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Allen Bolourchi,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vision Language World Model (VLWM) trained on natural videos to enhance high-level, language-based planning, achieving state-of-the-art results in visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level world models for semantic and temporal reasoning in planning remain underdeveloped, prompting the need for VLWM to address this gap.

Method: VLWM uses visual observations, language-based goal inference, and trajectory predictions through self-refined LLM outputs. It learns an action policy and a dynamics model for dual-system planning via cost minimization, evaluated using a self-supervised critic model.

Result: VLWM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) benchmarks and PlannerArena evaluations, with notable System-2 improvements, and surpasses strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed VLWM shows significant advancements in integrating language-based reasoning and visual planning, demonstrating superior performance in both human evaluations and standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

### [4] [Deep Research is the New Analytics System: Towards Building the Runtime for AI-Driven Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02751)
*Matthew Russo,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a prototype combining LLM-driven Deep Research systems and semantic operators for optimized analytics on unstructured datasets, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing systems for AI-driven analytics, such as the inefficiency of semantic operators for interactive tasks and non-optimized query execution in Deep Research systems.

Method: The authors develop a prototype runtime that enables Deep Research systems to write and execute query plans optimized through semantic operators.

Result: The prototype outperforms handcrafted semantic operator programs and Deep Research systems, achieving up to 1.95x better F1-scores and significant reductions in cost and runtime (up to 76.8% and 72.7%).

Conclusion: A combination of semantic operator optimization and dynamic Deep Research execution offers a promising approach for efficient AI-driven data analytics.

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

### [5] [Do LLM Modules Generalize? A Study on Motion Generation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02754)
*Mingyi Wang,Jingke Wang,Tengju Ye,Junbo Chen,Kaicheng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the transferability of five key LLM modules to autonomous driving motion generation and demonstrates their significant potential when appropriately adapted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how advancements in LLMs can be applied to motion generation in autonomous driving, since both domains share similarities in sequence modeling and decision-making.

Method: The paper evaluates five LLM modules (tokenizer design, positional embedding, pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, test-time computation) on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark through extensive experiments.

Result: Appropriately adapted LLM modules show significant performance improvements in autonomous driving motion generation. It identifies transferable techniques and reasons for the failure of certain approaches.

Conclusion: LLM components can be effectively adapted for autonomous driving, with insights into the necessary adaptations and limitations for leveraging their full potential in this domain.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

### [6] [Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761)
*Ananth Hariharan,Vardhan Dongre,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative framework where LLMs revise noisy task plans and human demonstrations to refine embodied AI trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of noisy task plans and human demonstrations in embodied AI, which include unnecessary actions and logical errors that degrade policy quality.

Method: The proposed method leverages two large language models—a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM revises them iteratively, using natural language prompting for generalization across diverse errors.

Result: The verification framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision in correcting actions for the TEACh dataset with four LLMs, converges rapidly within three iterations for 96.5% of sequences, and improves temporal efficiency and spatial organization.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates that LLMs can reliably refine task plans for spatial planning in embodied AI, enhancing data quality for imitation learning while preserving human error-recovery characteristics.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

### [7] [Key Principles in Cross-Domain Hyper-Heuristic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02782)
*Václav Sobotka,Lucas Kletzander,Nysret Musliu,Hana Rudová*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing hyper-heuristics by strategically transforming their low-level heuristic (LLH) sets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop adaptable, general-purpose search strategies by rethinking the composition and transformation of low-level heuristics in hyper-heuristics.

Method: The paper analyzes transformations of LLHs using solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation intensity. These transformations are applied to a random selection mechanism to evaluate their impact.

Result: The transformed mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics on three real-world domains, finds 11 new best solutions, and competes with the CHeSC competition winner.

Conclusion: Strategic transformation of LLHs enhances hyper-heuristic performance, simplifies designs, and sets new benchmarks in real-world and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

### [8] [Learning General Policies From Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02794)
*Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable symbolic method for policy learning, which overcomes limitations in scaling associated with previous combinatorial approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability issues of combinatorial methods for learning policies from small training sets and limited features.

Method: A symbolic learning approach utilizing a hitting set algorithm to generalize sampled plans, ensuring structural termination and acyclicity.

Result: The proposed approach handles millions of states and pools with hundreds of thousands of features, demonstrating improved scalability on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The symbolic method provides formal guarantees and scalability, offering a robust alternative to SAT/ASP-based methods for learning general policies.

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

### [9] [Uncertainty-driven Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03219)
*Leonidas Bakopoulos,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive exploration framework that uses uncertainty to switch between exploration and exploitation, improving learning in environments requiring complex actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining the right moments to switch between exploration and exploitation in complex learning domains.

Method: A generic framework that leverages uncertainty measures, such as intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty, for adaptive exploration.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms standard exploration strategies in multiple MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: Using uncertainty effectively enables better adaptive exploration and can generalize previous approaches to improve learning performance.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

### [10] [app.build: A Production Framework for Scaling Agentic Prompt-to-App Generation with Environment Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03310)
*Evgenii Kniazev,Arseny Kravchenko,Igor Rekun,James Broadhead,Nikita Shamgunov,Pranav Sah,Pratik Nichite,Ivan Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates app.build, an open-source framework designed to enhance large language model (LLM)-based application generation through robust validation and structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of reliable AI application generation and improve production scalability by focusing on systematic validation and structured technological environments.

Method: The framework includes multi-layered validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and a model-agnostic architecture tested across three reference stacks and evaluated in 30 generation tasks.

Result: Validation increases viability rates to 73.3%, with 30% achieving perfect quality. Structured environments enable open-weight models to reach 80.8% of closed-model performance.

Conclusion: Scaling reliable AI frameworks depends on scalable environments alongside models, and app.build provides empirical insights and an open-source reference implementation to advance production-ready AI agent systems.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

### [11] [Accountability Framework for Healthcare AI Systems: Towards Joint Accountability in Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03286)
*Prachi Bagave,Marcus Westberg,Marijn Janssen,Aaron Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the ambiguity surrounding AI accountability in healthcare by providing a three-tier framework to bridge the gap between regulatory goals and practical mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of AI in healthcare requires clear accountability structures, yet current guidelines are vague and focus on 'what' should be done, rather than 'how' to implement accountability.

Method: The authors analyze the concept of accountability in healthcare AI, develop an accountability framework, and propose a three-tier structure for implementing accountability mechanisms within healthcare systems.

Result: The proposed framework categorizes mechanisms for healthcare AI accountability and highlights the need for shared responsibility and collaboration among stakeholders, emphasizing the role of explainability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a collaborative, explainability-driven approach is essential to foster accountability in healthcare AI, enabling better communication and joint responsibilities.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

### [12] [Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345)
*Yunxin Sun,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models' inductive and abductive reasoning using a new dataset, but finds they struggle with complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore reasoning beyond deductive reasoning in AI, focusing on inductive and abductive capabilities that are underexplored but crucial for real-world problem-solving.

Method: Introduced InAbHyD, a programmable dataset with reasoning tasks requiring hypothesis generation under incomplete models, and proposed an Occam's Razor-based metric to evaluate hypotheses.

Result: State-of-the-art large language models perform well on simple tasks but face difficulties with complex world models and high-quality hypothesis generation, even using techniques like in-context learning and RLVR.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in inductive and abductive reasoning, significant challenges remain in handling complexity and quality in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

*Peter J. Bentley,Soo Ling Lim,Fuyuki Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bottom-up framework for AI agents that situates them in their environment and introduces 'aspects,' enabling zero information leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current LLM AI agents, which are often autonomous but constrained by unreliable mechanisms leading to inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, particularly in information leakage.

Method: The paper introduces a bottom-up framework that defines agent behavior through environmental triggers and proposes 'aspects,' inspired by the umwelt concept. This design ensures agents perceive their environment distinctly.

Result: Through implementation, it is shown that the proposed architecture achieves zero information leakage, compared to the 83% leakage observed in typical architectures.

Conclusion: The aspective approach for AI agents promotes better security and efficiency by enabling specialized agents to operate effectively within their respective information domains.

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

*Yiyang Huang,Zixuan Wang,Zishen Wan,Yapeng Tian,Haobo Xu,Yinhe Han,Yiming Gan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies security risks in embodied AI systems, focusing on adversarial attacks that exploit vision-language-action models to cause unsafe actions. It introduces a benchmark and framework to evaluate these vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EAI systems, despite advancing robot capabilities, pose new security risks as minor adversarial inputs to vision-language-action models can lead to unsafe actions in physical environments.

Method: The authors formalize a taxonomy of safety violations, define benchmarks with safety-critical scenarios, and develop an adversarial framework, ANNIE-Attack, to evaluate the security of EAI systems.

Result: Attacks achieved over 50% success rates in causing unsafe actions in various scenarios, demonstrating vulnerabilities across critical, dangerous, and risky safety categories.

Conclusion: EAI systems have significant security risks that need to be addressed with innovations in defense mechanisms as they operate in physical environments. The study highlights the necessity for security-driven regulatory measures.

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

*Zhuo Cao,Yunxiao Shi,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM-LLM is a hybrid approach for autonomous driving that combines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of kinematic models for lane change trajectory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a trajectory prediction system that is interpretable, computationally efficient, and combines contextual reasoning with physical accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces SAM-LLM, which fine-tunes an LLM to output parameters of a physical trajectory model (e.g., lateral displacement and velocity changes) instead of coordinate predictions.

Result: The model reduces output size by 80% compared to coordinate-based methods, achieves 98.73% accuracy in lane intention prediction, and matches traditional LLM predictors in performance.

Conclusion: SAM-LLM provides a state-of-the-art solution that balances performance with explainability and computational efficiency for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

*Zhantong Qiu,Mahyar Samani,Jason Lowe-Power*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Nugget is a framework for efficient workload sampling across simulators and hardware by using LLVM IR to generate cross-platform executables, significantly reducing analysis time and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural evaluation is hindered by slow simulation and inefficient sampling pipelines, necessitating a more flexible and portable solution.

Method: Nugget operates on LLVM IR, performing interval analysis and generating lightweight executables that can be validated on real machines and used for simulation.

Result: Nugget achieves orders of magnitude reduction in interval analysis cost (up to 578X faster) and supports tools like gem5 for system performance and accuracy evaluation.

Conclusion: Nugget accelerates and simplifies sampling methodology research, making it more portable while maintaining low overhead and enabling native-speed validation.

Abstract: Comprehensive architectural evaluation of full workloads is throttled by slow
simulation and per-binary sampling pipelines. We present Nugget, a flexible
framework for portable sampling across simulators and real hardware, ISAs, and
libraries. Nugget operates at the LLVM IR level to perform binary-agnostic
interval analysis, then emits lightweight, cross-platform
executables--nuggets--that can be validated on real machines before driving
simulation. Across SPEC CPU2017, NPB, and LSMS, Nugget cuts interval-analysis
cost by orders of magnitude relative to functional simulation (up to ~578X on
multithreaded NPB), keeps single-thread overhead low, and enables native-speed
validation of selected samples. Case studies with gem5 show that nuggets
support evaluation of system performance and model accuracy. Nugget makes
sampling methodology research faster and more portable.

### [17] [FastCaps: A Design Methodology for Accelerating Capsule Network on Field Programmable Gate Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03103)
*Abdul Rahoof,Vivek Chaturvedi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to accelerate Capsule Network (CapsNet) performance on FPGAs through novel pruning and optimization techniques, achieving significant compression and throughput improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet offers better image variation understanding and generalization but is hard to accelerate on FPGAs due to its structural and computational complexity. Real-world applications require an efficient hardware implementation.

Method: The authors use a two-step approach: (1) The Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology to prune the network effectively. (2) Simplifying non-linear operations, loop reordering, and parallelizing the routing mechanism to reduce hardware complexity.

Result: Results demonstrated effective compression rates of 99.26% and 98.84% on MNIST and F-MNIST datasets, with initial throughput of 82 FPS and 48 FPS, improved to 1351 FPS and 934 FPS after hardware complexity reduction.

Conclusion: The work enables performance-efficient and cost-effective deployment of full CapsNet on low-cost FPGA systems, showing potential for edge device applications.

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown significant improvement in understanding
the variation in images along with better generalization ability compared to
traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CapsNet preserves spatial
relationship among extracted features and apply dynamic routing to efficiently
learn the internal connections between capsules. However, due to the capsule
structure and the complexity of the routing mechanism, it is non-trivial to
accelerate CapsNet performance in its original form on Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA). Most of the existing works on CapsNet have achieved limited
acceleration as they implement only the dynamic routing algorithm on FPGA,
while considering all the processing steps synergistically is important for
real-world applications of Capsule Networks. Towards this, we propose a novel
two-step approach that deploys a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. First, we prune
the network using a novel Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology that
uses the sum of look-ahead scores of the model parameters. Next, we simplify
the nonlinear operations, reorder loops, and parallelize operations of the
routing algorithm to reduce CapsNet hardware complexity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work accelerating a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA.
Experimental results on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets (typical in Capsule
Network community) show that the proposed LAKP approach achieves an effective
compression rate of 99.26% and 98.84%, and achieves a throughput of 82 FPS and
48 FPS on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA, respectively. Furthermore, reducing the hardware
complexity of the routing algorithm increases the throughput to 1351 FPS and
934 FPS respectively. As corroborated by our results, this work enables highly
performance-efficient deployment of CapsNets on low-cost FPGA that are popular
in modern edge devices.

### [18] [CapsBeam: Accelerating Capsule Network based Beamformer for Ultrasound Non-Steered Plane Wave Imaging on Field Programmable Gate Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03201)
*Abdul Rahoof,Vivek Chaturvedi,Mahesh Raveendranatha Panicker,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents CapsBeam, a novel capsule network-based beamforming model for ultrasound imaging, achieving enhanced image quality and efficiency while addressing challenges of deployment on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art deep learning techniques for ultrasound beamforming are computationally intensive, making deployment on resource-limited edge devices challenging. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The proposed CapsBeam model uses capsule networks to process raw radio-frequency ultrasound data, combined with model pruning (LAKP-ML methodology) and hardware optimizations, including quantization and operations parallelization. A specialized accelerator for the pruned model was implemented on the Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA.

Result: CapsBeam showed significant improvements over traditional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming: up to 32.31% increase in image contrast, and notable enhancements in axial and lateral resolutions. The model achieved an 85% compression ratio without reducing image quality, while hardware implementation delivered throughputs of 30 GOPS (convolution) and 17.4 GOPS (dynamic routing).

Conclusion: CapsBeam effectively enhances ultrasound imaging performance and operational efficiency, demonstrating its suitability for deployment on resource-constrained hardware platforms.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in accelerating
computationally complex non-real-time beamforming algorithms in ultrasound
imaging using deep learning models. However, due to the large size and
complexity these state-of-the-art deep learning techniques poses significant
challenges when deploying on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work,
we propose a novel capsule network based beamformer called CapsBeam, designed
to operate on raw radio-frequency data and provide an envelope of beamformed
data through non-steered plane wave insonification. Experiments on in-vivo
data, CapsBeam reduced artifacts compared to the standard Delay-and-Sum (DAS)
beamforming. For in-vitro data, CapsBeam demonstrated a 32.31% increase in
contrast, along with gains of 16.54% and 6.7% in axial and lateral resolution
compared to the DAS. Similarly, in-silico data showed a 26% enhancement in
contrast, along with improvements of 13.6% and 21.5% in axial and lateral
resolution, respectively, compared to the DAS. To reduce the parameter
redundancy and enhance the computational efficiency, we pruned the model using
our multi-layer LookAhead Kernel Pruning (LAKP-ML) methodology, achieving a
compression ratio of 85% without affecting the image quality. Additionally, the
hardware complexity of the proposed model is reduced by applying quantization,
simplification of non-linear operations, and parallelizing operations. Finally,
we proposed a specialized accelerator architecture for the pruned and optimized
CapsBeam model, implemented on a Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA. The proposed accelerator
achieved a throughput of 30 GOPS for the convolution operation and 17.4 GOPS
for the dynamic routing operation.

*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Zimeng Huang,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DrDiff, a new framework designed to enhance long-text generation by balancing efficiency and quality through dynamic expert scheduling, hierarchical sparse attention, and a new guidance optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and quality trade-offs in long-text generation tasks, especially with existing computational methods.

Method: DrDiff integrates three strategies: (1) dynamic expert scheduling for resource allocation based on text complexity, (2) hierarchical sparse attention for computational efficiency in handling long inputs, and (3) a soft absorption guidance strategy combined with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps and improve speed.

Result: Experiments on long-text generation benchmarks demonstrated that DrDiff outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: DrDiff proves to be an advanced and efficient method for long-text generation, setting a new benchmark in balancing computational efficiency and textual quality.

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are integrated and benchmarked within ESPnet, particularly targeting domain-shifted speech recognition tasks like child speech and dialectal variation, featuring the novel SSVD method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are computationally expensive to fine-tune for specific applications, requiring scalable and efficient methods to adapt them, especially in the context of speech processing, where progress lags behind text and vision applications.

Method: The paper benchmarks PEFT methods, including LoRA and variants (VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, SVFT), within ESPnet-optimized speech recognition tasks. It introduces SSVD fine-tuning, which employs structured singular value decomposition with selective input vector rotation to ensure efficiency and domain adaptability.

Result: The SSVD method showcased robust domain adaptation with fewer trainable parameters, outperforming existing PEFT methods under domain-shifted conditions like child speech and dialectal variation, spanning model scales from 0.1B to 2B parameters.

Conclusion: Structured singular value decomposition fine-tuning (SSVD) enables more efficient domain adaptation in speech tasks compared to classical PEFT methods, while contributing to reproducibility and facilitating future advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes narratives about Black and white women generated by LLaMA 3.2-3B, revealing colonial biases in the representation of the female body.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how large language models may reinforce historical inequalities through their narratives about race and gender.

Method: Quantitative grouping of 2100 semantically similar stories, followed by qualitative discourse analysis to uncover patterns.

Result: Three discursive representations were identified: social overcoming, ancestral mythification, and subjective self-realization, showing colonially influenced framing.

Conclusion: Integrating computational methods with manual analysis reveals biases linked to colonial histories and structural inequalities in AI-generated narratives.

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on evaluating large language models (LLMs) in performing interpretive annotation tasks. It introduces a new benchmarking method called IDEAlgin and demonstrates that LLMs using this method align better with expert judgments compared to traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of evaluating LLM-generated annotations against expert human annotations for open-ended tasks, as no scalable and validated measure currently exists.

Method: A novel benchmarking paradigm, IDEAlgin, is proposed. It uses a "pick-the-odd-one-out" task to capture expert similarity ratings. Various similarity metrics, including traditional vector-based ones and prompting LLMs in IDEAlgin, are evaluated against human benchmarks.

Result: Vector-based metrics fail to capture nuanced dimensions of similarity, while LLMs in IDEAlgin show a 9-30% increase in alignment with expert judgments when compared to traditional metrics.

Conclusion: IDEAlgin represents a significant advancement in scalable evaluation of LLMs for open-ended, expert-level annotation tasks, paving the way for more responsible and accurate use of LLMs in areas like education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated, iterative adversarial system to enhance Arabic long-context QA generation using multiple specialized LVLMs without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the long-context reading and question-answering skills of Arabic LVLMs through automated, self-improving workflows suitable for diverse domains.

Method: A self-evolving closed-loop workflow including a question generator, an evaluator, and answer generators. It uses iterative refinement, continuous feedback, and tunable quality metrics.

Result: The approach shows substantial improvement compared to static methods, and the authors release AraLongBench as a new benchmark dataset for Arabic long-context QA tasks.

Conclusion: The introduced adversarial system boosts long-context understanding in Arabic LVLMs, offers customizable difficulty levels for QA, and provides a fully automated workflow for handling large Arabic documents.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates transformer-based architectures and graph augmentation for detecting minority stress in online discourse, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexual and gender minority groups face disproportionately poor health outcomes often due to minority stress, necessitating better detection tools to identify and address this issue.

Method: Multiple transformer models (ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, BART) and traditional machine learning approaches were benchmarked. Graph-augmented variants and various learning paradigms (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) were tested on Reddit corpora, comprising over 18,000 posts.

Result: Graph-augmented transformers consistently improved stress detection performance, with supervised fine-tuning of relational context outperforming zero and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Graph-enhanced transformers are effective for identifying minority stress markers like stigma and social connectivity, providing a solid foundation for digital health interventions and public health policies.

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study fine-tuned a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) via LoRA to simultaneously perform Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) efficiently, showing strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to integrate APA and MDD capabilities into a single system, reducing complexity and making Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) more efficient and accessible for English L2 learners.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning Microsoft's Phi-4 multimodal model using the LoRA technique on the Speechocean762 dataset, without extensively adjusting the architecture or fully training all layers.

Result: The model exhibited a PCC > 0.7 with human-assigned evaluation scores and achieved low WER and PER (< 0.15), proving its effectiveness with minimal adjustments.

Conclusion: This approach shows that multimodal models adapted with LoRA can effectively and efficiently handle integrated APA and MDD tasks, paving the way for simplified CAPT systems for L2 learners.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to identify and extract implicit content moderation criteria from historical moderation data in online communities, offering a transparent and interpretable approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online communities often have diverse and implicit content moderation standards, creating a need for a systematic way to identify and make these criteria explicit.

Method: The authors use an interpretable architecture to extract lexical patterns from historical moderation data. They represent moderation criteria as score tables associating lexical expressions with content removal.

Result: The extracted lexical patterns can effectively replicate the performance of neural moderation models while offering transparency and revealing significant variations in enforcement of moderation norms across communities.

Conclusion: This approach provides a systematic and interpretable way to uncover implicit moderation criteria, revealing community-specific tolerances for language, topical restrictions, and subcategories of toxic speech norms.

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, aimed at enhancing assembly task assistants. It uses human-activity recordings, instruction manuals, and task graphs for benchmarking models, highlighting significant improvement potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of testbeds for evaluating systems aiding assembly tasks, which are important in everyday and industrial scenarios. The paper seeks to support progress in this field.

Method: The authors developed a multimodal QA dataset (ProMQA-Assembly) with 391 QA pairs, combining semi-automated approaches with LLM for annotation. They incorporated fine-grained action labels and instruction task graphs to ensure diverse and practical evaluation.

Result: Benchmarking on existing models, including proprietary multimodal systems, showed large gaps in performance, indicating room for improvement in multimodal understanding for assembly tasks.

Conclusion: ProMQA-Assembly provides a foundation for progress in procedural-activity assistants by offering a practical evaluation framework, encouraging improvements in multimodal system design and functionality.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiaCBT, a curated dataset using CBT principles to train language models for psychotherapy conversations, showing potential to improve access to mental health support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited access to psychotherapy caused by social stigma and therapist scarcity by leveraging large language models for mental health interventions.

Method: The authors create a long-periodic dialogue dataset for counseling grounded in CBT principles, using cognitive conceptualization diagrams to simulate diverse client scenarios. They train and evaluate counseling models based on psychological benchmarks for CBT.

Result: The proposed DiaCBT dataset improves LLMs' capacity to emulate professional psychologists skilled in CBT, as demonstrated through thorough evaluations.

Conclusion: DiaCBT holds promise for developing enhanced AI-driven counseling agents, potentially broadening access to effective mental health services.

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

TL;DR: The study introduces the Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss to enhance Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) models by addressing class imbalance, improving both accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness of ASA models by mitigating the challenge of biased predictions caused by class imbalance.

Method: Introduced a novel training objective, BLV loss, that perturbs model predictions to better represent minority classes, without altering the dataset.

Result: Integrating BLV loss into a BERT-based model improved classification accuracy and fairness when evaluated on the ICNALE benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: BLV loss is an effective tool for making ASA models more robust and equitable for diverse L2 learners.

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced training method for text embeddings in large language models (LLMs) by refining the semantic representation of the final token, improving their performance on retrieval and re-ranking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of LLM-based text embeddings in capturing whole-context semantics through the final token, which reduces their effectiveness in applications like retrieval and re-ranking.

Method: The authors propose a new training procedure before contrastive learning using bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks—EBQ2D and EBD2Q—to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance improvements on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks for various LLM models.

Conclusion: Adding a generative reconstruction training stage strengthens the final token embeddings of LLMs, enhancing their utility in retrieval and re-ranking tasks and achieving superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges such as parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and limited adaptability in fine-tuning large language models across multiple tasks.

Method: The method involves adapter-based fine-tuning with differentiable gating functions and structural sparsity control variables to optimize adapter insertion points and module combinations automatically. It uses a structure search mechanism to dynamically construct efficient task-specific substructures while keeping the backbone parameters frozen.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior accuracy, compression rate, and robustness to noise and perturbation in multi-task natural language understanding tasks when compared to mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed adapter-based fine-tuning method flexibly adjusts model structures to task-specific needs, enhancing parameter efficiency, representational power, and robustness.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper employs a modified long short-term memory (LSTM) model for business sentiment analysis, using a product review dataset. Testing indicates a superior performance with 91.33% accuracy compared to conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentiment analysis techniques for businesses by addressing limitations like the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent neural networks, enabling businesses to better interpret customer feedback.

Method: A modified LSTM approach was implemented using a product review dataset for business sentiment analysis. 70% of the data was used for training and 30% for testing. Performance was compared with existing conventional RNN models.

Result: The modified LSTM model achieved 91.33% accuracy, showcasing enhanced performance in business sentiment analysis compared to conventional RNN models.

Conclusion: The proposed LSTM model is effective in analyzing customer sentiment for business purposes, enabling companies to refine their marketing strategies based on customer feedback.

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

### [34] [Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116)
*Hauke Licht,Rupak Sarkar,Patrick Y. Wu,Pranav Goel,Niklas Stoehr,Elliott Ash,Alexander Miserlis Hoyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates methods for using large language models (LLMs) to measure continuous scalar constructs in social science, comparing techniques like direct scoring, pairwise comparisons, token-weighted scoring, and finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective methods to evaluate constructs, such as language complexity and emotionality, which are continuous rather than categorical, using the capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The study examines LLM performance on scalar construct measurement across political science datasets by testing four techniques, including direct scoring, pairwise comparisons, token-probability weighting, and finetuning smaller models.

Result: The findings highlight that direct pointwise scoring leads to discontinuous distributions, pairwise comparisons offer improvement, token-probability weighting results in better scores, and finetuning smaller models with limited training data can outperform prompted LLMs.

Conclusion: Prompted LLMs are useful for scalar construct measurement but finetuning smaller, specific models with limited data provides superior results and practical insights for researchers.

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

*Yue Li,Xin Yi,Dongsheng Shi,Yongyi Cui,Gerard de Melo,Xiaoling Wang,Linlin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel approach to intellectual property protection for Large Language Models (LLMs) by using knowledge editing instead of traditional instruction tuning for fingerprint injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for intellectual property protection in LLMs demands efficient techniques as current methods like instruction tuning degrade model performance and require intensive computational resources.

Method: The authors introduce a knowledge editing-based fingerprint injection method and design Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT) to mitigate fingerprint degradation during model adjustments.

Result: FSFT improves performance, showing a 10% increase over fine-tuning in challenging scenarios, and highlights issues with LLMs' ability to differentiate between fingerprinted and similar texts.

Conclusion: Knowledge editing presents a lightweight and effective alternative for fingerprint injection in LLMs, though further improvements are needed to refine recognition between fingerprints and similar texts.

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

*Kaidi Lõo,Arvi Tavast,Maria Heitmeier,Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores lexical processing in Estonian through a word naming task combined with eye-tracking and examines if computational model-based predictors outperform classical predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to understand the predictive power of measures from the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) against traditional predictors like word frequency and neighborhood size in lexical processing.

Method: A single-subject experiment using eye-tracking and word naming, analyzing five response variables with a generalized additive model. Both linear and deep computational models of DLM were tested.

Result: Key findings include that DLM-based measures are predictive of lexical processing but deep DLM mappings do not outperform linear ones; classical predictors better explain some variables, except for total fixation duration, where DLM and classical predictors perform similarly.

Conclusion: The study concludes that lexical meaning is deeply involved in word naming tasks, as DLM's form-to-meaning mappings significantly influence response variables like naming latency and spoken word duration.

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a translation evaluation benchmark for six Romansh varieties and examines machine translation (MT) system performance, finding that translations into Romansh remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of machine translation evaluation resources for the Romansh language necessitates the development of robust benchmarks.

Method: The study developed a benchmark based on WMT24++ with human-created reference translations for six Romansh varieties and conducted automatic evaluations using existing MT systems and large language models (LLMs).

Result: Translation from Romansh to German performs relatively well for all varieties, while translation into Romansh remains difficult.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights areas needing improvement in MT systems for Romansh and serves as a foundation for future work to enhance Romansh translation quality.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

TL;DR: This paper explores fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) tasks without transforming data into natural language, demonstrating improvements in performance and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Process Mining (PM) approaches using LLMs rely on transforming event logs into narrative datasets, which limits their application. The study seeks to directly leverage LLMs’ token generation abilities for PM without such transformations.

Method: The paper employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs on PPM tasks, focusing on both single-task and multi-task setups to minimize computational overhead and improve performance.

Result: The fine-tuned LLMs show a marked improvement in predictive performance, particularly for multi-task predictions, while also exhibiting faster convergence and requiring less hyperparameter tuning compared to RNNs and narrative-style-based solutions.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for PM tasks without natural language transformation is both effective and efficient, offering significant advancements over traditional and alternative approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SinhalaMMLU, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Sinhala, revealing challenges for models in low-resource languages and culturally specific topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often focus on anglocentric evaluations, neglecting low-resource languages and cultural topics. Multilingual benchmarks typically rely on automatic translations, which compromise the original meaning and cultural context.

Method: The authors created SinhalaMMLU with over 7,000 multiple-choice questions covering six domains and 30 subjects aligned with the Sri Lankan curriculum, emphasizing culturally specific concepts. They tested 26 LLMs using this dataset.

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o scored best with accuracies of 67% and 62%, but models in general performed poorly, especially in culturally rich domains like the Humanities.

Conclusion: This study highlights the limitations of current LLMs in handling low-resource languages and culturally specific content and calls for advancements in these areas.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching
language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes
on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenTracer, a framework designed to improve the accuracy of diagnosing errors in multi-agent AI systems, outperforming existing models significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in pinpointing errors in complex multi-agent AI systems, as current reasoning LLMs fail with accuracy below 10%.

Method: They developed AgenTracer using techniques like counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection to create a curated dataset and leveraged multi-granular reinforcement learning to build a lightweight failure tracer model.

Result: AgenTracer-8B improves failure attribution accuracy by up to 18.18% compared to proprietary models and enhances the performance of existing multi-agent systems by 4.8-14.2%.

Conclusion: AgenTracer advances multi-agent error diagnosis and provides actionable feedback, driving self-correcting and self-evolving AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

*Daniela Gottesman,Alon Gilae-Dotan,Ido Cohen,Yoav Gur-Arieh,Marius Mosbach,Ori Yoran,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LMEnt, a comprehensive suite designed to analyze knowledge acquisition in language models (LMs) during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how language models process and represent world knowledge in order to build more consistent, robust, and complete models.

Method: Developed a knowledge-rich annotated corpus, an improved entity-based retrieval method, and pretrained models with intermediate checkpoints. These resources serve as tools for controlled analyses and studying causal relationships in pretraining.

Result: The suite demonstrates that fact frequency is important for knowledge acquisition but does not entirely explain learning behavior. LMEnt outperforms prior retrieval methods and facilitates detailed studies on how LMs acquire and process knowledge.

Conclusion: LMEnt is a valuable resource for advancing the understanding of knowledge representation and learning dynamics in LMs, paving the way for improvements in model design and capabilities.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

### [44] [Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03407)
*Yarden Tzach,Ronit D. Gross,Ella Koresh,Shalom Rosner,Or Shpringer,Tal Halevi,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanisms of pre-training and fine-tuning in natural language processing (NLP) using a BERT-6 architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the mechanisms of successful pre-training and understand the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning in NLP.

Method: The study used the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks while analyzing features such as accuracy per token (APT) and token grouping patterns.

Result: Pre-training improved APT, sharpened token clusters along transformer blocks, and enhanced fine-tuning performance. Output label confidence remained independent of average input APT.

Conclusion: Pre-training creates higher-order language structures, influencing fine-tuning positively, and hints at similarities between NLP and image classification learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ComplexEval, a benchmark to explore and quantify biases in large language model evaluations, especially for complex tasks, revealing significant susceptibility to biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliably evaluating large language models on increasingly complex tasks, where nuanced criteria and multi-faceted rubrics are critical.

Method: Developed ComplexEval, a benchmark to systematically identify and quantify six previously unexplored biases across 15 different scenarios (12 basic, 3 advanced).

Result: All models tested were significantly susceptible to biases, and the level of bias increased with task complexity; larger reasoning models were paradoxically more vulnerable.

Conclusion: Insights from the study highlight the need to improve the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, aiming for more robust evaluation frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

*Soukeina Elhassen,Lama Al Khuzayem,Areej Alhothali,Ohoud Alzamzami,Nahed Alowaidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces KAU-CSSL, the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset, alongside a novel transformer-based model, achieving 99.02% and 77.71% accuracy in signer-dependent and independent modes, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and translation techniques for Arabic sign languages, especially Saudi Sign Language (SSL), which serve as vital communication tools for over 84,000 individuals in Saudi Arabia.

Method: The researchers developed KAU-CSSL, a continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset focused on full sentences, and proposed a transformer-based model combining ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for analyzing temporal dependencies.

Result: The model achieved 99.02% accuracy in signer-dependent mode and 77.71% accuracy in signer-independent mode, showcasing its effectiveness in SSL recognition and translation.

Conclusion: The study lays the groundwork for advanced SSL recognition and translation systems, enhancing communication tools for the Saudi Sign Language community and contributing to the broader field of sign language research.

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates video multi-modal large language models' ability to perform pixel-level visual grounding using motion-centric references, introducing benchmarks and adaptations to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can use motion patterns for pixel-level visual grounding rather than relying solely on static appearance cues.

Method: They introduced motion-centric probing techniques and a benchmark named MoCentric-Bench, to examine MLLMs' ability in spatiotemporal reasoning and to discern real motion from fake motion.

Result: The study established strong baseline methods based on single frames, showed these baselines can match or surpass existing techniques, and proposed motion-centric adaptations that achieved state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of interaction between motion and language in visual grounding tasks, providing actionable benchmarks and adaptation methods to improve video MLLMs' spatiotemporal grounding.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colon cancer remains a highly malignant disease worldwide, making early detection crucial to prevent worsening outcomes. Advanced methods are needed for accurate classification of histopathological images.

Method: The paper presents HG-TNet, a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that integrates capsule networks, graph attention, transformer modules, and residual learning. It utilizes transformers for global relationships and CNNs for local details, with self-supervised rotation prediction.

Result: The proposed HG-TNet model achieves better performance in accuracy and loss metrics compared to standard architectures, leveraging capsule networks for spatial order preservation and improved structural understanding.

Conclusion: HG-TNet advances colon cancer classification by combining strengths of transformers and CNNs, demonstrating superior performance in analyzing histopathological images from the LC25000 dataset.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to optimize echocardiographic video acquisition for diagnosing aortic stenosis (AS), achieving improved efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aortic stenosis is highly prevalent but often underdiagnosed due to limited access to echocardiography, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The paper introduces an RL-driven active video acquisition system that dynamically selects the most informative echo views for each patient, optimizing the diagnostic process.

Result: On a dataset of 2,572 patients, the approach achieved 80.6% classification accuracy while reducing the need for echo videos to 47% of the full acquisition volume.

Conclusion: The RL-based method enhances diagnostic efficiency, making AS diagnosis more scalable, efficient, and personalized, particularly for underserved regions.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: LiGuard facilitates rapid development and sharing of lidar research projects, fostering collaboration and reducing redundant efforts in the field.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost, time, and labor required for creating labeled datasets hinder the scalability of LiDAR-based perception systems. Sim2Real learning offers a scalable alternative but depends on high simulation fidelity.

Result: The methodology enables scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation for LiDAR perception tasks, facilitating robust Sim2Real learning.

Conclusion: By leveraging HiFi DTs, the approach provides a reliable and reproducible framework to create synthetic datasets, addressing the challenges of scalability and cost in real-world dataset generation.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the Sim2Real gap in LiDAR-based perception for intelligent transportation systems by reducing performance degradation caused by distributional shifts when transitioning from simulation to real-world data.

Method: The method involves developing high-fidelity digital twin simulations that incorporate real-world data (e.g., background geometry, road topology, sensor specs) to generate synthetic data, aligning it more closely with real-world conditions, and systematically measuring alignment and generalization.

Result: A 3D object detector trained on synthetic data from the proposed HiFi DT framework outperforms its counterpart trained on real data by 4.8%. Various metrics (CD, MMD, EMD, FD) demonstrate reduced domain shift and superior generalization.

Conclusion: High-fidelity digital twins significantly enhance synthetic-to-real generalization, bridging the Sim2Real domain gap and enabling more reliable LiDAR perception in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG is a neuro-symbolic framework combining vision transformers and expert-guided symbolic reasoning for better generalization in diabetic retinopathy classification under unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor domain generalization in medical imaging, particularly in diabetic retinopathy classification, where models fail under real-world distribution shifts.

Method: Integration of clinical lesion ontologies and symbolic reasoning with vision transformers using a confidence-weighted strategy, coupled with minimizing KL divergence for domain alignment.

Result: Achieved up to 5.2% accuracy improvement in cross-domain settings, 6% better than pure ViT baselines, with symbolic components outperforming deep learning-only approaches.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration enhances domain-invariant generalization in medical AI, acting as effective regularizers and improving clinical robustness beyond interpretability.

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAR, a lightweight and open-source framework for quickly and robustly aligning serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) using rigid registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for registering serial WSIs are computationally intensive and complex, posing challenges for routine use and reproducibility in scenarios where simpler rigid alignment is often sufficient.

Method: The paper proposes the STAR framework, which incorporates stain-conditioned preprocessing, hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation, adaptive kernel scaling, and built-in quality control for robust rigid alignment of WSIs.

Result: STAR demonstrates reliable alignment across diverse stains and tissue types on benchmark datasets (ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022), achieving stable results in minutes and handling challenges like cross-stain variability and partial overlaps.

Conclusion: As an open-source and lightweight tool, STAR lowers the barrier for clinical adoption, facilitates reproducible research, and enables large-scale preparation of paired datasets for computational pathology.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

### [58] [Resilient Multimodal Industrial Surface Defect Detection with Uncertain Sensors Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02962)
*Shuai Jiang,Yunfeng Ma,Jingyu Zhou,Yuan Bian,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of modality-missing problems in multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) using RGB and 3D data. It proposes a prompt-based method coupled with contrastive learning and demonstrates superior results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address uncertainties in sensor availability that cause missing modalities in MISDD applications, which adversely affect defect detection accuracy.

Method: The study introduces 'cross-modal prompt learning' consisting of consistency prompts, modality-specific prompts, and missing-aware prompts. It also employs symmetric contrastive learning with paired antithetical text prompts to bridge RGB and 3D modalities.

Result: The proposed method achieved an I-AUROC of 73.83% and P-AUROC of 93.05% at a 0.7 missing rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.84% and 5.58% respectively.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective in handling varying missing types and rates, and demonstrates its potential to improve multimodal defect detection in industrial applications.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

### [59] [EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964)
*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet is a novel segmentation architecture that improves fine-scale segmentation of solar filaments, especially barbs, outperforming traditional U-Net models on the MAGFILO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods struggle with accurately capturing fine-scale solar filament structures, such as barbs, which are vital for understanding filament chirality and CME behavior.

Method: A segmentation model called EdgeAttNet is proposed, modifying the U-Net backbone by incorporating a learnable edge map into the attention mechanism to enhance spatial sensitivity and filament boundary recognition.

Result: EdgeAttNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and recognition of filament barbs compared to U-Net and other baselines, with faster inference performance.

Conclusion: EdgeAttNet offers an efficient and effective solution for fine-scale solar filament segmentation, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KEPT is a knowledge-enhanced vision-language model designed for accurate short-horizon trajectory predictions in autonomous driving, evaluated on nuScenes with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack sufficient grounding in scene dynamics and autonomous driving knowledge, causing limitations in trajectory prediction.

Method: The paper introduces KEPT, which integrates a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder with a k-means + HNSW retrieval system, embedding retrieved priors into chain-of-thought prompts and applying a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule.

Result: KEPT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with very low collision rates under multiple protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical scalability.

Conclusion: KEPT showcases that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising pathway for interpretable and reliable autonomous driving without compromising efficiency or data requirements.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

### [62] [InstaDA: Augmenting Instance Segmentation Data with Dual-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02973)
*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA is a novel system combining large language models and diffusion models to improve instance segmentation datasets without the need for training. It significantly enhances segmentation metrics compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving instance segmentation data is crucial as current methods are labor-intensive and suffer from class imbalances. Leveraging large language models and diffusion models collaboratively has untapped potential for dataset augmentation.

Method: InstaDA employs two agents: the Text-Agent (T-Agent), which refines prompts iteratively for generating diverse images, and the Image-Agent (I-Agent) to generate new segmentation instances conditioned on training images. Both workflows are training-free and automated.

Result: Experiments on LVIS 1.0 validation set show InstaDA provides a notable performance boost, including +4.0 box AP and +3.3 mask AP versus baseline, and outperforms DiverGen by +0.3 (box AP) and +0.1 (mask AP). Gains are also observed in common and frequent categories.

Conclusion: InstaDA effectively improves instance segmentation datasets by leveraging new prompt-refinement mechanisms and automating workflows via its dual-agent system, which results in significant performance gains over baseline and leading models.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

*Chao Fan,Xibin Jia,Anqi Xiao,Hongyuan Yu,Zhenghan Yang,Dawei Yang,Hui Xu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation by proposing SPENet, which enhances prototype-based methods through a more nuanced approach using global and local prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based segmentation methods for FSMIS often suffer from neglecting intra-class variations, leading to suboptimal matching with query images.

Method: The proposed SPENet introduces two key modules: (1) Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) for generating both global and adaptive local prototypes, and (2) Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE) to refine local prototypes based on query image guidance.

Result: SPENet demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, validated across three public medical datasets.

Conclusion: SPENet effectively addresses the weaknesses of traditional prototype methods in FSMIS by incorporating multi-granularity and query-guided enhancements, leading to improved segmentation outcomes.

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

*Chenhao Wang,Yingrui Ji,Yu Meng,Yunjian Zhang,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOPSeg, a framework for small object segmentation in remote sensing, addressing limitations of current methods and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and gaps in small-object instance segmentation in remote sensing imagery, especially the lack of dedicated datasets and SAM's performance decline for small objects.

Method: SOPSeg leverages a region-adaptive magnification strategy to enhance fine-grain details, a specialized decoder with edge prediction and progressive refinement, and a novel prompting mechanism based on oriented bounding boxes.

Result: The proposed SOPSeg outperforms existing small-object segmentation methods and aids in creating efficient datasets for remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: SOPSeg enhances small-object segmentation in remote sensing, overcomes technical limitations of existing approaches, and provides valuable resources for the research community.

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

*Tzuhsuan Huang,Cheng Yu Yeo,Tsai-Ling Huang,Hong-Han Shuai,Wen-Huang Cheng,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates post-processing watermarking for images, a versatile approach that embeds watermarks after image generation, compatible with various generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness of post-processing watermarking, which can flexibly apply to images from different generative models without access to their internal structures.

Method: The study employs an ensemble attack network in training, combining CNN and Transformer-based networks in spatial and frequency domains to examine robustness.

Result: The combination of CNN and Transformer-based attack networks achieves the highest robustness, with a significant improvement in watermarking methods during extensive evaluations on the WAVES benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves robustness of watermarking models, particularly enhancing StegaStamp’s performance by 18.743% in stress tests, showcasing its effectiveness in the domain.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

Result: The proposed approach outperformed baseline models in generating high-quality captions and improving MES classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential in standardizing and supporting reliable clinical interpretation in ulcerative colitis endoscopic reporting.

Abstract: We present a lesion-aware image captioning framework for ulcerative colitis
(UC). The model integrates ResNet embeddings, Grad-CAM heatmaps, and
CBAM-enhanced attention with a T5 decoder. Clinical metadata (MES score 0-3,
vascular pattern, bleeding, erythema, friability, ulceration) is injected as
natural-language prompts to guide caption generation. The system produces
structured, interpretable descriptions aligned with clinical practice and
provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting

*Sohee Kim,Soohyun Ryu,Joonhyung Park,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses an issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) where they incorrectly assume textual inputs without visual evidence are part of an image, and proposes a detection module to rectify this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LVLMs' erroneous perception of text inputs as visually grounded in images, leading to flawed outputs.

Method: Identified 'Visual Absence-aware' (VA) neurons that detect absence through activation patterns and developed a detection module to classify visually grounded tokens. The outputs are refined by addressing false visual presence.

Result: The proposed method reduces LVLMs' errors in assuming text inputs are visually present, demonstrating its generality across diverse LVLMs.

Conclusion: This method enhances the accuracy and reliability of LVLMs by mitigating their false assumptions of visual presence for text inputs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

*Kaicong Huang,Talha Azfar,Jack M. Reilly,Thomas Guggisberg,Ruimin Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses person re-identification challenges by proposing a novel dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction framework that integrates foreground and background semantics for better identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to balance eliminating background noise while focusing on fine-grained features. The authors argue that background semantics can aid re-identification by mimicking human perception, addressing gaps in current approaches.

Method: The paper introduces intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategies to align cross-modal features while penalizing foreground-background similarity, thereby enhancing discriminative power.

Result: The method achieves strong performance on ReID benchmarks, showcasing effectiveness in both holistic and occluded scenarios, either matching or surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Foreground and background semantics together improve ReID performance, and the proposed cross-modal framework is shown to be effective and generalizable.

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation is critical for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis, but existing models face limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and working with small medical datasets.

Method: The proposed MedLiteNet network incorporates depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks, a cross-scale token-mixing module, and a boundary-aware self-attention mechanism for efficient and precise lesion segmentation.

Result: The MedLiteNet successfully combines the strengths of CNNs and Transformers to achieve precision skin-lesion segmentation while maintaining efficiency for small datasets.

Conclusion: The MedLiteNet approach improves skin-lesion segmentation by leveraging lightweight architectures and integrating global context modeling, making it well-suited for medical applications with limited data.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

*Chengjie Huang,Jiafeng Yan,Jing Li,Lu Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge framework to address challenges in ill-posed multi-task scenarios where tasks lack intrinsic correlations and training data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing conditional diffusion models struggle with exploiting intrinsic correlations for multi-task scenarios and face difficulties in dynamically adapting to evolving characteristics, especially in ill-posed tasks.

Method: The proposed paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes to reduce reliance on supervised data, introduces dynamic conditions to adjust statistical characteristics over time, and embeds time-related information to facilitate easier network learning.

Result: The dynamic conditions demonstrate superior performance through learning objective analysis and attention weight comparisons. In ill-posed tasks like dehazing and visible-infrared fusion, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple indicators on public datasets.

Conclusion: This approach effectively resolves challenges in ill-posed multi-task scenarios by leveraging dynamic conditional settings, achieving improved performance and adaptability. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of classifying Bangla handwritten characters, addressing challenges like distinct and compound characters and overcoming issues like the vanishing gradient problem.

Method: The study employs transfer learning techniques combined with 3DCNN, ResNet, and MobileNet for end-to-end classification using the Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset.

Result: The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training data and 99.46% accuracy on test data, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model offers superior accuracy and efficiency in the classification of Bangla handwritten characters, demonstrating its effectiveness over existing methods.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound
characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten
characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network
techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105
Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used
for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training
data and 99.46% accuracy on test data. Comparisons with various
state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show
that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

### [72] [High Cursive Complex Character Recognition using GAN External Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03062)
*S M Rafiuddin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADA-GAN, a generative adversarial network model designed to classify cursive and complex handwritten characters more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten characters are challenging to classify due to their cursive and complex nature, and the paper seeks to improve classification accuracy for such scenarios.

Method: A GAN architecture is developed with a generator producing augmented training data by generating fake handwritten images with added adversarial noise, paired with a discriminator ensuring data quality above a confidence threshold.

Result: The proposed ADA-GAN demonstrates improved robustness and effectiveness in handling complex and cursive character classification compared to traditional convolutional neural networks.

Conclusion: ADA-GAN provides a validated solution for more robust classification of highly cursive and complex handwritten characters, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

*Clément Hervé,Paul Garnier,Jonathan Viquerat,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes leveraging features from a general-purpose 3D generative model, TRELLIS, to improve the analysis of intracranial aneurysms across three tasks, achieving significant accuracy and simulation improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial aneurysms are challenging to detect and analyze due to the limited availability of annotated 3D medical data.

Method: The authors use geometric features derived from TRELLIS, a generative model trained on non-medical 3D datasets, to improve neural network performance in classifying, segmenting, and simulating aneurysm-related data.

Result: The approach significantly boosts accuracy, F1-scores, and segmentation quality while also reducing simulation errors by 15%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Transferring 3D geometric representations from general-purpose generative models can enhance specialized medical tasks, demonstrating the versatility of such cross-domain feature-transfer strategies.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

### [74] [Backdoor Poisoning Attack Against Face Spoofing Attack Detection Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03108)
*Shota Iwamatsu,Koichi Ito,Takafumi Aoki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a backdoor poisoning attack that manipulates face anti-spoofing systems to misclassify spoofed images as live without detectable changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face anti-spoofing methods rely heavily on deep learning, making them susceptible to manipulated training data. The paper explores the threat of maliciously altering training data to bypass spoof detection.

Method: The proposed backdoor attack embeds features from spoof images into live images covertly, allowing spoofing attacks to evade detection systems.

Result: Experiments on public datasets reveal that the backdoor attack successfully circumvents current spoofing detection systems.

Conclusion: The research highlights the vulnerability of existing face anti-spoofing systems to backdoor poisoning attacks, prompting a need for more resilient detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

### [75] [Information transmission: Inferring change area from change moment in time series remote sensing images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03112)
*Jialu Li,Chen Wu,Meiqi Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAIM-Net, a time series change detection network that unifies the tasks of detecting the change area and identifying the change moment. It utilizes a three-stage process to enhance detection and ensure consistency between spatial and temporal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve ecosystem monitoring by addressing the disjointed approach in time series change detection networks, which currently treat change area detection and change moment identification as separate tasks.

Method: The proposed method, CAIM-Net, consists of three steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction with Change Area Inference. It employs batch stacking, boundary enhancement convolution, and multiscale temporal CAM modules to detect changes more effectively.

Result: The CAIM-Net successfully combines temporal and spatial analysis, ensuring consistent results between change areas and moments by inferring areas from moments.

Conclusion: CAIM-Net provides a novel and effective approach for time series change detection, improving accuracy and consistency in detecting ecosystem changes over time.

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

### [76] [Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113)
*Shan Wang,Maying Shen,Nadine Chang,Chuong Nguyen,Hongdong Li,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles hallucinations in multimodal large language models by addressing text-visual and co-occurrence biases. It introduces a novel gradient-based self-reflection technique to detect token influences and a contrastive decoding framework for improving accuracy without additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models suffer from hallucinations caused by biases in decision-making processes due to over-reliance on text and statistical biases from training data. Current methods to mitigate these issues are heuristic and do not adapt to varying bias levels.

Method: The paper introduces a gradient-based self-reflection approach to estimate token influence from visual, prompt, and previous outputs. Using these insights, a contrastive decoding framework is developed to integrate object-related visual tokens and address biases systematically.

Result: The method significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance, showing an increase of up to 92% in accuracy on the LLaVA-QA90 benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates hallucinations in multimodal large language models without requiring fine-tuning, additional models, or data statistics, offering an efficient solution to bias-related issues.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

### [77] [Towards Realistic Hand-Object Interaction with Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03114)
*Miao Xu,Xiangyu Zhu,Xusheng Liang,Zidu Wang,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GravityDB, a new method to simulate realistic hand-object interactions, addressing issues like interpenetration and unrealistic hand deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hand-object interactions struggle with interpenetration and gaps due to the complexity of hand and object geometries and fail to capture realistic hand deformations.

Method: Proposed Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB), which formulates interactions via an attraction-driven model, considering deformable hand surfaces and rigid objects.

Result: GravityDB generates realistic hand-object interactions, free of interpenetration, enabling stable grasping and capturing natural hand deformations. It also uses semantic textual guidance to create meaningful interaction zones.

Conclusion: The method advances hand-object interaction modeling by achieving physically plausible results backed by strong experimental validation across datasets.

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

### [78] [Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model for Brain Progression Modelling with Bidirectional Temporal Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03141)
*Mattia Litrico,Francesco Guarnera,Mario Valerio Giuffrida,Daniele Ravì,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D) for accurately predicting brain progression in MRI volumes, emphasizing temporal changes and 3D anatomical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing MRI prediction methods, such as their inability to capture detailed temporal relationships, reliance on scan interpolation, and the use of 2D models that miss full anatomical context.

Method: The proposed TADM-3D incorporates a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) for better modeling age-related changes and uses a Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR) technique to improve temporal prediction accuracy, training on bidirectional scans.

Result: The model was trained on the OASIS-3 dataset and validated its generalization ability on the NACC dataset, showing improved accuracy in predicting brain progression.

Conclusion: TADM-3D offers a novel and effective approach to generating temporally and anatomically accurate MRI scans, with potential clinical applications for assessing disease progression.

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

*Karol Szustakowski,Luk Frank,Julia Esser,Jan Gründemann,Marie Piraud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel loss functions to improve segmentation continuity in CNNs and evaluates their efficacy using biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of discontinuity in biomedical segmentation, which affects structural and length accuracy.

Method: The Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss are applied to CNNs, combined with specific experiment designs like downscaling and spacing corrections.

Result: The proposed methods significantly reduce discontinuities, particularly in areas with missing signals, leading to better instance length measurements.

Conclusion: Embedding structural priors into loss functions can substantially improve segmentation reliability for biological tasks.

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

*Mattia Litrico,Feng Chen,Michael Pound,Sotirios A Tsaftaris,Sebastiano Battiato,Mario Valerio Giuffrida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Count2Density, a novel pipeline that predicts density maps with spatial details using only count-level annotations, avoiding the need for detailed location annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by the need for fine-grained, location-level annotations in crowd density estimation, which are tedious to collect and limit scalability in practical scenarios.

Method: Count2Density uses a Historical Map Bank with past predictions, initialized by an unsupervised saliency estimator, to create pseudo-density maps iteratively updated. The technique also includes a self-supervised contrastive regularizer to enhance spatial awareness.

Result: Experimental results show that Count2Density outperforms cross-domain adaptation methods and surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across datasets. Component-wise analysis highlights its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Count2Density successfully extracts spatial details from count-level annotations and achieves accurate subregion counting, making it a scalable and accurate solution for crowd density estimation.

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates poisoning attacks on military object detection systems, evaluates current detection methods, and proposes a new autoencoder-based method, AutoDetect, for identifying poisoned samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the severe yet under-researched issue of poisoning attacks on object detection systems, particularly in the high-risk military domain.

Method: The authors create a custom military vehicle dataset (MilCivVeh) and implement a modified BadDet patch-based poisoning attack. They assess the attack's impact and test various detection methods, introducing their own autoencoder-based detection method, AutoDetect.

Result: The study shows that poisoning attacks are achievable but require a significant portion of data to be poisoned, questioning their practicality. The proposed AutoDetect method outperforms existing methods in identifying poisoned samples, with reduced time and memory requirements.

Conclusion: Poisoning attacks in the military domain are a serious but complex challenge. The paper highlights the lack of adequate detection methods and the need for large, representative datasets, demonstrating that AutoDetect is a promising solution in this field.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

TL;DR: The paper presents PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based denoising method for low-dose CT scans, achieving superior imaging quality and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of increased noise and reduced image quality in low-dose CT scans while minimizing radiation exposure.

Method: The researchers developed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based approach that uses an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm within a custom gym environment to dynamically optimize denoising policies based on image quality feedback.

Result: The method outperformed traditional and deep learning denoising techniques with a PSNR of 41.87, SSIM of 0.9814, and RMSE of 0.00236 on a low-dose CT dataset, and similar superior performances on other datasets, including improved COVID-19 classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based denoising method is effective for safer and higher-quality low-dose CT imaging, proving beneficial in various applications like COVID-19 classification.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack interpretation of non-verbal emotional signals, limiting empathetic interaction possibilities.

Method: Proposed Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) utilizes a cross-modal fusion transformer, supervised contrastive learning, emotion-aware prompt engineering, and interactive features like TTS and animated avatars.

Result: OURS enables interaction with emotionally aligned and animated responses, enhancing HCI.

Conclusion: The framework broadens AI applications in robotics, social care, and mental health with emotion-aware capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved

lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment

transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RTGMFF, a novel framework combining automatic text generation and multimodal feature fusion for fMRI-based brain disorder diagnosis, addressing challenges like low signal-to-noise ratios and limited frequency awareness. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and limited frequency awareness in prevailing models hinder effective clinical diagnosis using fMRI data. Additionally, most fMRI datasets lack helpful textual annotations to contextualize regional activation and connectivity.

Method: RTGMFF has three main components: 1) ROI-driven fMRI text generation for encoding subject data into text tokens, 2) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder that integrates hierarchical wavelet processing with a cross-scale Transformer encoder, and 3) Adaptive semantic alignment to embed and harmonize information between ROI token sequences and visual features.

Result: RTGMFF demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to current methods, with significant improvements in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve in tests on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE datasets.

Conclusion: RTGMFF effectively advances brain-disorder diagnosis by unifying ROI-driven text generation and multimodal feature fusion, achieving reliable clinical outcomes on standard benchmarks and bridging gaps in fMRI analysis.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Result: The proposed model achieves high segmentation accuracy and robustness when tested on organoid datasets.

Conclusion: LGBP-OrgaNet offers a reliable and non-destructive solution for advancing organoid research through efficient segmentation and tracking.

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling
methods risk compromising their structure. Therefore, this paper proposes an
automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We
introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for
organoid research.

Conclusion: PI3DETR provides a simple and effective approach for estimating 3D curves directly from raw point cloud data, marking a significant improvement over traditional methods.

Abstract: We present PI3DETR, an end-to-end framework that directly predicts 3D

*Hongxu Yang,Edina Timko,Levente Lippenszky,Vanda Czipczer,Lehel Ferenczi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynBT, a 3D medical diffusion model designed to generate realistic breast tumors in MRI images to enhance segmentation models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tumor synthesis methods struggle with large spatial volumes, especially in breast tumor segmentation in MRI, where the field-of-view is large.

Method: The authors propose a patch-to-volume autoencoder that compresses MRI data into latent space while maintaining high resolution, and a mask-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize realistic breast tumors within target regions.

Result: The method improved performance in tumor segmentation models (2-3% Dice Score) on a large public MRI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed SynBT model generates high-quality synthetic tumors and benefits segmentation tasks by improving model accuracy for breast tumor detection in MRI.

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for 3D anomaly detection using CLIP's 2D generalization capabilities and combining point- and pixel-level information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage CLIP's 2D generalization ability for identifying anomalies in 3D across unseen objects with diverse class semantics.

Method: Two methods are developed: PointAD for implicit 3D representation focusing on pixel anomalies and PointAD+ for explicit 3D spatial relationships, introducing hierarchical anomaly representation and cross-layer interaction.

Result: The proposed PointAD+ framework excels in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection across different object classes using extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PointAD+ provides a unified, effective framework combining implicit and explicit anomaly representations for a comprehensive understanding of 3D anomalies, enhancing Plug-and-Play testing with RGB integration.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data to enhance the reasoning abilities of lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) and finds success through a two-step process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reasoning capabilities of lightweight multimodal language models (fewer than seven billion parameters) have not been thoroughly studied, especially in comparison to their larger counterparts.

Method: First, perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight MLLMs using long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data. Then, further refine the models through a reinforcement learning (RL) stage.

Result: Lightweight MLLMs show significant improvement in reasoning performance after SFT with long CoT data, with further gains observed following the RL refinement.

Conclusion: Supervised fine-tuning with long CoT data is essential for enhancing the reasoning abilities of lightweight MLLMs, and an additional RL stage can yield further performance gains.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Motivation: The study aims to tackle challenges in automated detection of astrocytes in histological images, particularly due to their intricate branching and variability.

Method: A hybrid CNN Transformer was proposed, integrating local feature extraction with global contextual reasoning. A heatmap query generates spatial anchors for small astrocytes, and a lightweight Transformer improves performance in dense areas.

Result: The model achieved higher sensitivity and fewer false positives than Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11, and DETR on ALDH1L1 and GFAP datasets, corroborated by FROC analysis.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN Transformer model is effective in astrocyte detection and sets a foundation for advanced pathology tools.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework for improving brick-level segmentation in point clouds, particularly in low-light environments like tunnels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in fine-grained segmentation of masonry point clouds, especially in low-light conditions where high-resolution RGB imaging is impractical.

Method: The method involves projecting point cloud data into depth maps using virtual cameras and enhancing these images using the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM) without task-specific training.

Result: InfraDiffusion significantly improves brick-level segmentation in masonry datasets by enhancing the visual and geometric quality of depth maps, enabling better performance with SAM.

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion is a promising framework for automated inspection of masonry structures, aiding in tasks like defect detection in challenging environments.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents T-CAGU, a novel framework combining transformers and graph neural networks for hyperspectral unmixing, improving both global dependencies and local consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses weaknesses in current hyperspectral unmixing methods, specifically their challenges in preserving long-range interactions and fine-grained boundary details.

Method: T-CAGU employs a transformer for capturing global dependencies and a content-adaptive graph neural network for enhancing local relationships. It introduces multi-order propagation to learn graph structures dynamically and a graph residual mechanism to stabilize training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that T-CAGU surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance and robustness against noise.

Conclusion: The proposed T-CAGU framework effectively integrates advanced components to address limitations in hyperspectral unmixing, proving its success through superior experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in image classification but suffer from high computational costs due to processing all image tokens.

Result: The framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% across standard image classification benchmarks with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: TinyDrop is effective for efficient ViT-based classification, showcasing generalizability and usability without compromising performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore), a method for evaluating concept customization using aspect-wise assessments through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It also presents CC-AlignBench, a benchmark dataset targeting single- and multi-concept tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing metrics in evaluating concept customization, especially in multi-concept contexts, which often misalign with human preferences.

Method: The paper proposes D-GPTScore, a human-aligned evaluation that breaks down evaluation criteria into finer aspects and uses MLLM for aspect-wise assessments. It also introduces CC-AlignBench as a comprehensive benchmark dataset.

Result: The results demonstrate that D-GPTScore outperforms existing methods, showing a stronger alignment with human preferences on the CC-AlignBench dataset.

Conclusion: The study sets a new standard for evaluating concept customization, highlights challenges for multi-concept assessments, and makes resources openly available for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal framework for breast cancer molecular subtyping, combining data from CNV, clinical records, and histopathology images in an adaptable and scalable manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer molecular subtyping is vital for improving personalized treatment and prognosis, but data modalities in clinical settings are often inconsistent.

Method: The proposed framework integrates multiple data modalities and introduces a dual-based representation for WSIs alongside a new multimodal fusion strategy.

Result: The framework achieved better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping by combining CNV, clinical data, and histopathology image analysis.

Conclusion: The scalable system can incorporate additional modalities with ease, paving the way for its application in other types of cancers as well.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved State-Space Model (SSM) for dense video captioning, enabling real-time processing and reducing computational complexity for long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense video captioning faces challenges in handling long videos due to their high computational demands and memory limitations, and traditional methods being unable to process videos online.

Method: The paper proposes "State-Space Models with Transfer State," an approach that scales SSMs for longer sequences and incorporates recurrent properties to maintain states over extended contexts.

Result: The method efficiently processes dense video captioning tasks in an online manner with significantly reduced computational cost—7x fewer FLOPs compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model is effective for real-time dense video captioning and scales efficiently with video length, offering substantial practical benefits.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal framework combining EEG, image, and text data to improve decoding of visual neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges posed by low signal-to-noise EEG signals and enhance visual content decoding using multimodal data.

Method: Introduced a text modality for semantic alignment, an adapter module for feature stability, MCDB strategy for balancing contributions, and SPR for generalization improvement.

Result: The proposed method achieved better Top-1 (2.0% improvement) and Top-5 (4.7% improvement) accuracy on the ThingsEEG dataset compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully aligns multimodal data and enhances decoding performance, advancing the field of neural representation analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes JTGD, a system for road defect detection that jointly trains image generators and detectors, improving accuracy without ensemble methods or test-time augmentation and using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient road defect detection systems, deployable on edge devices with limited computational resources, motivated the research.

Method: JTGD utilizes dual discriminators for generative models and introduces a CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance loss to improve image quality, training the generative model alongside the detector to generate challenging synthetic data.

Result: JTGD achieves better performance on the RDD2022 benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods, while using less than 20% of the parameters of competing baselines.

Conclusion: JTGD is a resource-efficient and effective solution for road defect detection, offering practical applicability for edge devices without relying on ensemble methods or TTA.

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an efficient and effective adaptation technique for low-level vision tasks, particularly NR-IQA, avoiding the costly full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models.

Method: The proposed method uses visual prompts optimized in pixel-space, requiring only 600K adjustable parameters, leaving the base model completely frozen. These prompts are combined with images during inference and processed by the mPLUG-Owl2 model with a predefined textual query.

Result: The method achieves strong results across datasets representing various distortion types, such as achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k, showing competitive performance with full finetuned models and specialized NR-IQA systems.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that pixel-space visual prompts can efficiently adapt MLLMs for low-level vision tasks like NR-IQA, offering a novel, resource-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. The approach expands the potential of MLLMs in vision-related adaptations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

*Kevin Barnard,Elaine Liu,Kristine Walz,Brian Schlining,Nancy Jacobsen Stout,Lonny Lundsten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark dataset for multi-object tracking in deep-sea videos, evaluates detection and tracker models, and shares tools and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to facilitate consistent evaluation and comparison of multi-object tracking and detection models, specifically in deep-sea habitats.

Method: The study created a dataset of four deep-sea video sequences and evaluated models and trackers using the Higher Order Tracking Accuracy metric.

Result: The research provides the first publicly available benchmark dataset for deep-sea video tracking, alongside tools for further usage.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables reproducible evaluation and improved model development for deep-sea multi-object tracking tasks.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

*Honglu Zhou,Xiangyu Peng,Shrikant Kendre,Michael S. Ryoo,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Juan Carlos Niebles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Strefer, a framework to generate synthetic data for Video Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve spatiotemporal reasoning, thus addressing limitations in resolving spatial and temporal references in dynamic real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack the capability for fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning needed to understand spatial and temporal references in real-world environments.

Method: The Strefer framework generates synthetic instruction data by pseudo-annotating fine-grained video metadata, capturing spatial and temporal details such as subjects, objects, locations, actions, and timelines.

Result: Models trained using Strefer-generated data outperform baseline models on tasks demanding spatial and temporal disambiguation and demonstrate improved space-time-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: The Strefer approach establishes a solid foundation for instruction-tuned Video LLMs with perceptual grounding, thus enabling higher performance in tasks requiring spatiotemporal reasoning without relying on proprietary models or expensive human annotations.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unique database to study the genetic component and familial influences on handwriting patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in understanding whether handwriting traits are influenced by genetics or family relationships.

Method: A database was created featuring handwritten samples across various components (digits, letters, shapes, paragraphs) from 210 families, capturing familial relationships.

Result: The study identified handwriting similarities among family members through comparative feature analysis.

Conclusion: The database, made available to the pattern recognition community, enables future investigations into hereditary and familial effects on handwriting.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

*Ouxiang Li,Yuan Wang,Xinting Hu,Huijuan Huang,Rui Chen,Jiarong Ou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces T2I-CoReBench, a benchmark to assess the composition and reasoning abilities of text-to-image (T2I) models, highlighting gaps in handling complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks inadequately evaluate composition and reasoning abilities, especially for complex and high-density prompts, limiting the understanding of model performances.

Method: The paper proposes a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy focusing on scene graph elements (instance, attribute, relation) and inference types (deductive, inductive, abductive). It includes 1,080 prompts with detailed checklists of 13,500 yes/no questions for fine-grained assessment.

Result: Experiments with 27 T2I models demonstrate limited performance on complex composition tasks and even weaker reasoning capabilities, especially for inferring implicit elements in prompts.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap in T2I models' reasoning capabilities, and T2I-CoReBench offers a structured method to drive advancements in addressing these bottlenecks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

*Amirhossein Shahbazinia,Darong Huang,Luis Costero,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CloudFormer, a Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in black-box cloud environments, achieving superior predictive accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in multi-tenant cloud environments due to resource competition and lack of performance isolation.

Method: The method involves using a dual-branch Transformer model that processes 206 system metrics at high temporal resolution to predict transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload conditions.

Result: CloudFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.8%, with at least a 28% improvement in predictive accuracy across diverse workloads.

Conclusion: CloudFormer demonstrates robust performance in dynamic cloud environments, enabling accurate prediction of performance degradation and enhancing resource management.

Abstract: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse,
resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and
cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are
consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While
virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,
it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such
as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to
severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM
scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction
to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds
due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.
To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch
Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in
black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and
system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second
resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the
model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload
conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we
provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal
resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization
across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a
mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement
in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

*Benedikt Pittl,Werner Mach,Erich Schikuta*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tax model called GreenCloud tax to promote energy-efficient cloud datacenters by penalizing energy-inefficient ones, leading to reduced energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rising energy requirements for cloud datacenters, there is a need for innovative approaches to improve energy efficiency in cloud computing.

Method: The authors developed a taxation model, GreenCloud tax, implemented using CloudSim simulation with real dataset benchmarks, to penalize inefficiency and incentivize energy-efficient datacenters.

Result: The GreenCloud tax fosters workload shifts from energy-inefficient datacenters to energy-efficient ones by enabling cost advantages for providers.

Conclusion: The GreenCloud tax serves as an economic solution to encourage energy-efficient practices in cloud datacenters, aligning cost incentives with sustainability goals.

Abstract: The cloud computing technology uses datacenters, which require energy. Recent
trends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,
or at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed
different algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy
efficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term
Green Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for
reducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called
GreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering
datacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running
energy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,
which consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient
datacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was
implemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data
sets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,
which we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax.

TL;DR: Mycroft is a tracing and root cause analysis system to tackle reliability issues in LLM training, providing rapid anomaly detection and cause identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability issues during large language model training hinder efficiency and often go unresolved due to opaque communication processes.

Method: Mycroft utilizes distributed tracing for collective communication states, analyzing control and data dependencies to address reliability challenges.

Result: Mycroft detected anomalies in 15 seconds (90% of cases) and identified root causes in 20 seconds (60% of cases). Extensive fault injection experiments supported its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Mycroft is effective in improving reliability during LLM training by quickly identifying and addressing communication issues, demonstrated in both real-world and experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However,
many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in
wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's
collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical
information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a
lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to
address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.
Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage
internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM
training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug
collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies
within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20
seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection
experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

TL;DR: FlashRecovery introduces a fast failure recovery system optimized for large-scale language model training, addressing key challenges like hardware/software failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle reliability issues and loss of training time in large-scale language model training due to hardware/software failures.

Method: FlashRecovery integrates three key modules: real-time failure detection, scale-independent restart strategy, and checkpoint-free recovery.

Result: Experiments showed 150-second training restoration for a cluster of 4,800 devices with consistent recovery times across different cluster scales.

Conclusion: FlashRecovery enhances efficiency and reliability in large-scale LLM training, achieving optimal recovery metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various
fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at
unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and
sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in
maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern
is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and
software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a
fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)
Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous
training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and
software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)
Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for
normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group
reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains
nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery
within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,
completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and
their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery
to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration
LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can
achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150
seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly
consistent for different scales of training tasks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents an open-source benchmark for evaluating serverless autoscaling systems, offering insights into performance-cost trade-offs and revealing inefficiencies in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of open and detailed benchmarks and analyses for understanding performance-cost trade-offs in serverless control plane designs.

Method: They designed an open-source serverless system replicating commercial platforms and evaluated autoscaling policies by replaying real-world workloads, paired with hybrid methodologies of large-scale simulation and control plane deployments.

Result: Key findings include significant CPU overhead (10-40% from instance churn) and high memory allocation (2-10x more than used) in serverless systems, which impact performance and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for cost-efficient autoscaling policies by showcasing limitations in current systems and provides tools to bridge the gap between research and real-world production environments.

Abstract: Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the
performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood
due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses.
In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that
approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and
cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by
replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters.
  We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the
operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and
transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect
latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First,
we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due
to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request
handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high
memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.
Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in
significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the
need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a
hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with
large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale,
thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol utilizing publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), achieving efficient message transmission and stability while maintaining resilience to adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latency and security challenges in BFT consensus protocols for dynamically available systems, which often struggle with fluctuating node participation and adversarial behavior.

Method: The protocol integrates a pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), binding users' identities to their messages and reducing communication rounds.

Result: The proposed protocol achieves just four network delays (4Δ) in typical scenarios, offers resilience to up to 1/2 adversarial participants, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of fork prevention and chain stability.

Conclusion: The integration of PVSS enhances both the efficiency and security of BFT protocols, addressing latency and stability issues without sacrificing integrity.

Abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols for dynamically available
systems face a critical challenge: balancing latency and security in
fluctuating node participation. Existing solutions often require multiple
rounds of voting per decision, leading to high latency or limited resilience to
adversarial behavior. This paper presents a BFT protocol integrating a
pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) into
message transmission. By binding users' identities to their messages through
PVSS, our approach reduces communication rounds. Compared to other
state-of-the-art methods, our protocol typically requires only four network
delays (4$\Delta$) in common scenarios while being resilient to up to 1/2
adversarial participants. This integration enhances the efficiency and security
of the protocol without compromising integrity. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates the robustness of the protocol against Byzantine attacks.
Experimental evaluations show that, compared to traditional BFT protocols, our
protocol significantly prevents fork occurrences and improves chain stability.
Furthermore, compared to longest-chain protocol, our protocol maintains
stability and lower latency in scenarios with moderate participation
fluctuations.

TL;DR: The paper examines the computational power of mobile robot systems and how capabilities (like memory, lights, and synchrony) interact to solve distributed computing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal how the capabilities of mobile robots, including memory, observability (lights), and synchronization, influence the ability to solve distributed computing problems.

Method: The authors analyze multiple distributed computing problems under varying robot capabilities and synchronization levels. They map out canonical robot models, introduce new problems, and explore separations between model strengths.

Result: The study demonstrates problem solvability differences based on robot capabilities. For instance, some problems require full synchrony with lights, while others identify limits of memory-only models. It also extends a separation framework across 14 canonical models.

Conclusion: Robot computational power is shaped by the interplay of lights, memory, and synchrony, advancing our understanding of distributed systems and setting new impossibility boundaries.

Abstract: Understanding the computational power of mobile robot systems is a
fundamental challenge in distributed computing. While prior work has focused on
pairwise separations between models, we explore how robot capabilities, light
observability, and scheduler synchrony interact in more complex ways.
  We first show that the Exponential Times Expansion (ETE) problem is solvable
only in the strongest model -- fully-synchronous robots with full mutual lights
($\mathcal{LUMT}^F$). We then introduce the Hexagonal Edge Traversal (HET) and
TAR(d)* problems to demonstrate how internal memory and lights interact with
synchrony: under weak synchrony, internal memory alone is insufficient, while
full synchrony can substitute for both lights and memory.
  In the asynchronous setting, we classify problems such as LP-MLCv, VEC, and
ZCC to show fine-grained separations between $\mathcal{FSTA}$ and
$\mathcal{FCOM}$ robots. We also analyze Vertex Traversal Rendezvous (VTR) and
Leave Place Convergence (LP-Cv), illustrating the limitations of internal
memory in symmetric settings.
  These results extend the known separation map of 14 canonical robot models,
revealing structural phenomena only visible through higher-order comparisons.
Our work provides new impossibility criteria and deepens the understanding of
how observability, memory, and synchrony collectively shape the computational
power of mobile robots.

Conclusion: There exists a sweet spot in configurations that optimizes both training speed and efficiency in GPU usage.

Abstract: Training large-scale deep learning models has become a key challenge for the

TL;DR: A regularization technique named Lifecycle is introduced, enhancing neural networks by preserving learned states of dormant neurons to improve training stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability caused by reviving dormant neurons with random weights during extended deactivation in neural network regularization.

Method: Lifecycle principle employs state memory to restore dormant neurons to their last effective state, preserving learned knowledge and smoothing the loss landscape.

Result: Experiments show improved generalization and robustness in image classification tasks, with ablation studies highlighting the necessity of state memory for these enhancements.

Conclusion: The Lifecycle principle offers a solution to training instability, achieving better generalization through the reactivation of neurons with preserved learned states.

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Conclusion: The integration of EM inference with MARL offers a promising pathway for enhancing decentralized decision-making in conservation efforts, supported by experimental validation and publicly available resources.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical

real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial

environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG analysis is crucial in diagnosing neurological disorders like epilepsy, but challenges include its noisy, high-dimensional, and nonlinear nature that traditional methods struggle to handle.

Method: The authors utilize a Mamba-based selective state space model, trained on EEG data in a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure detection task to capture spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: The model demonstrated significant performance with an AUROC of 0.72 on the test set, indicating its efficacy in EEG seizure detection.

Conclusion: This work progresses towards creating scalable, clinically relevant foundation models for EEG data, addressing challenges in spatio-temporal modeling.

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

### [116] [Beyond Synthetic Augmentation: Group-Aware Threshold Calibration for Robust Balanced Accuracy in Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02592)
*Hunter Gittlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes group-aware threshold calibration as a more effective method for addressing class imbalance compared to synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenges posed by class imbalance in machine learning and the limitations of traditional methods like synthetic data generation.

Method: The authors use group-aware threshold calibration, which involves setting different decision thresholds for different demographic groups, and compare its performance against synthetic data methods through extensive experiments.

Result: Group-specific thresholds improve balanced accuracy by 1.5-4% and enhance worst-group balanced accuracy compared to methods like SMOTE and CT-GAN. Additionally, applying both methods provides minimal incremental gains.

Conclusion: Group-aware threshold calibration is simpler, more interpretable, and more effective than synthetic data generation for addressing class imbalance across diverse model families.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time adaptation method to improve sleep staging models under variable conditions, showing consistent gains without requiring patient-specific calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep staging models often struggle with unseen patient physiology and diverse recording conditions during deployment, which limits their reliability.

Method: The proposed approach combines entropy minimization (Tent) with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and incorporates two safety measures: an entropy gate and an EMA-based reset for adaptation stability.

Result: On the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset, the method demonstrated improvements over a baseline model with seconds-level latency and minimal memory requirements, while being model-agnostic.

Conclusion: The method enhances reliability and practicality for real-world applications without the need for patient-specific adaptation or source data, making it suitable for bedside or on-device use.

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

*Cheol Woo Kim,Shresth Verma,Mauricio Tec,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'DPO-PRO', a new fine-tuning algorithm for designing reward functions in public health resource allocation, focusing on robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for better alignment methods in designing reward functions for public health problems characterized by ambiguous objectives and limited data.

Method: The researchers developed DPO-PRO, which improves on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to handle uncertainty in human preferences.

Result: DPO-PRO shows consistent robustness against noisy preference signals and performs as well as prior baselines while reducing inference costs.

Conclusion: DPO-PRO is an effective and efficient method for reward function design, making it suitable for complex real-world applications in public health.

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

### [119] [Imitate Optimal Policy: Prevail and Induce Action Collapse in Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02737)
*Zhongzhu Zhou,Yibo Yang,Ziyan Chen,Fengxiang Bie,Haojun Xia,Xiaoxia Wu,Robert Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Bernard Ghanem,Shuaiwen Leon Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a phenomenon called Action Collapse (AC) in reinforcement learning policy gradient methods where activation structures naturally form a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). A new method, ACPG, is proposed to enforce this structure for more efficient and robust learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to better understand and improve the representational structures in policy gradient methods, hypothesizing that structuring the state-action representation can lead to more optimal policies.

Method: The authors analyze the emergent Action Collapse (AC) phenomenon and propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method, which uses a fixed ETF structure in the action selection layer to guide learning.

Result: ACPG led to improvements in reward acquisition speed and robustness across several OpenAI Gym environments.

Conclusion: Using an enforced ETF structure in policy networks enables faster and more stable training in reinforcement learning compared to standard PG methods.

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

*Gianmarco De Vita,Nargiz Humbatova,Paolo Tonella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoMap is a black-box, model-agnostic method for clustering inputs based on feature-space discrimination, leveraging dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to improve deep learning system testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL testing methods fail to comprehensively group inputs by feature-induced failures, leaving certain regions of the feature space unexplored.

Method: TopoMap creates topographical maps of input feature spaces by applying dimensionality reduction and clustering guided by a DNN-based evaluator for selecting optimal maps.

Result: The generated maps consist of meaningful regions that outperform random selection by 35% for mutation-killing inputs and 61% for non-killable mutants.

Conclusion: TopoMap enhances DL system testing by creating feature-based clusters, effectively targeting failure-inducing inputs and improving testing methodologies.

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

### [121] [LExI: Layer-Adaptive Active Experts for Efficient MoE Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02753)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Sandeep Madireddy,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LExI optimally adjusts the number of active experts in Mixture-of-Experts models to improve inference efficiency, significantly outperforming traditional pruning techniques with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models activate a fixed number of experts per layer, leading to redundant computation and suboptimal performance. Current pruning strategies mainly reduce memory usage but fail to enhance inference-time compute efficiency effectively.

Method: The paper introduces LExI, a data-free optimization method that uses model weights to assess the relative importance of each layer in a pretrained MoE model. Based on this, it adaptively assigns the number of active experts per layer without requiring additional training data.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art language and vision MoE benchmarks reveal that LExI achieves significantly better inference efficiency compared to existing MoE pruning methods, with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: LExI enhances MoE architectures by optimally adjusting expert activation per layer, delivering higher throughput and accuracy compared to traditional pruning techniques on GPUs like Nvidia H100.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

*Arnab Mazumder,Javier E. Santos,Noah Hobbs,Mohamed Mehana,Daniel O'Malley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transparent Earth, a transformer-based model for predicting subsurface properties using multiple data modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with integrating heterogeneous datasets of varying sparsity, resolution, and modality to predict Earth's subsurface properties.

Method: The model uses transformer architecture with positional and modality encodings derived from text embeddings, enabling the incorporation of diverse and scalable observation types.

Result: Transparent Earth reduces stress angle prediction errors by a factor of three and performs better when scaled with increased parameters.

Conclusion: The model serves as an initial foundation for universal predictions of Earth's subsurface properties, demonstrating scalability and adaptability to various data modalities.

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

### [123] [Structured Basis Function Networks: Loss-Centric Multi-Hypothesis Ensembles with Controllable Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02792)
*Alejandro Rodriguez Dominguez,Muhammad Shahzad,Xia Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework, the Structured Basis Function Network, which addresses gaps in predictive uncertainty by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensemble learning via centroidal aggregation based on Bregman divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predictive uncertainty either focus on diversity without proper aggregation or improve accuracy without capturing structured ambiguity.

Method: The Structured Basis Function Network uses centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences to unify multi-hypothesis prediction and ensemble learning. It includes both closed-form estimators and gradient-based procedures while controlling the bias-variance-diversity trade-off.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework by studying the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-offs across datasets with deep-learning models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates multi-hypothesis prediction and ensemble aggregation, offering tunable mechanisms to balance trade-offs and improve predictive uncertainty analysis.

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by learning Laplacian eigenvectors to improve their capability to capture global and regional graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are unable to effectively capture global and regional graph structures due to over-smoothing as network depth increases.

Method: The method involves pre-training GNNs by predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors from the graph Laplacian matrix, which encode large-scale structural patterns.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms baseline models in various graph structure-based tasks and demonstrates flexibility in its adaptability to all types of graph datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances GNNs' ability to learn structural graph patterns and offers a self-supervised and flexible pre-training method.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

*Yubo Gao,Renbo Tu,Gennady Pekhimenko,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the significant accuracy degradation when applying standard quantization techniques to Differentially-Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) due to amplified noise. It introduces a dynamic quantization framework, QPQuant, to mitigate this issue and improve training efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is widely used to enhance efficiency and reduce costs during neural network training. However, when applied to DP-SGD, it results in disproportionately high accuracy degradation due to noise amplification. Addressing this challenge is important to ensure privacy-preserving techniques remain practical and efficient.

Method: The proposed method, QPQuant, dynamically selects layers for quantization using two techniques: probabilistic sampling (rotating layer quantization across epochs) and loss-aware prioritization (quantizing layers with minimal impact on model quality, based on a differentially-private loss sensitivity estimator). This approach ensures minimal privacy budget consumption while improving efficiency.

Result: QPQuant demonstrated superior performance over static quantization methods across multiple neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet121) and datasets. It achieved substantial gains in throughput (up to 2.21x) on low-precision hardware with less than 2% drop in validation accuracy.

Conclusion: By addressing the interplay between DP-SGD noise and quantization, QPQuant offers a practical approach for efficient and accurate privacy-preserving training, maintaining DP guarantees while significantly enhancing hardware throughput and minimizing accuracy loss.

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper investigates conflict detection and resolution mechanisms in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically examining a state-of-the-art model's responses to conflicting inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of separating and understanding how VLMs detect conflicts in multimodal inputs and resolve them, aiming to enhance interpretability and robustness.

Method: Key methods include supervised metrics using linear probes, group-based attention pattern analysis, and mechanistic investigations of the LLaVA-OV-7B VLM's intermediate layers.

Result: Emergence of a linearly decodable conflict signal and distinct divergence of attention patterns related to detection and resolution at different network stages were observed.

Conclusion: Conflict detection and resolution mechanisms in VLMs are separate and functionally distinct, improving actionable insights for interpretability and model enhancements in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces JensUn, a method using Jensen-Shannon Divergence for better unlearning of specific information in LLMs, along with a dataset (LKF) and a more robust evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the safety of LLMs by effectively removing sensitive or harmful data from pre-trained models.

Method: JensUn leverages Jensen-Shannon Divergence for unlearning, introduces a new dataset (LKF), and proposes updated evaluation metrics like semantic judgement from LLMs and worst-case evaluation.

Result: JensUn demonstrates superior performance in forget-utility trade-offs and exhibits resilience to benign relearning during experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach and evaluation framework offer a significant advancement in reliable unlearning, exposing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk prediction, finding ensemble stacking delivers superior results for complex data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global health challenge of obesity by improving predictive models and exploring the comparative strengths of ensemble techniques.

Method: Two datasets are used to test three ensemble methods (Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, Stacking with MLP meta-classifier) on nine ML algorithms over 50 hyperparameter configurations.

Result: Stacking outperformed other methods, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores on both datasets.

Conclusion: Ensemble stacking enhances predictive capability for complicated data, while hybrid majority voting stands out as an alternative for robustness.

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM is known for enhancing generalization by optimizing both loss and sharpness, but its inefficiency in large-batch distributed systems motivates the need for an optimized, asynchronous approach.

Method: The authors propose LSAM, which introduces an asynchronous distributed sampling method to smooth the sharpness-aware loss landscape, thereby removing synchronization inefficiencies inherent in SAM.

Result: The LSAM optimizer improves training speed, addresses synchronization bottlenecks, and achieves higher final accuracy in large-batch distributed training compared to data-parallel SAM.

Conclusion: LSAM retains the generalization benefits of SAM while significantly improving efficiency in distributed training scenarios, presenting a more practical approach for scalable deep learning.

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges current conformal prediction methods face in handling non-stationary time series data with change points.

Method: The CPTC algorithm combines a state-predicting model with online conformal prediction to handle uncertainties in time series data.

Result: The CPTC algorithm was validated through theoretical proof and evaluation on six synthetic and real-world datasets, showing enhanced validity and adaptivity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CPTC is a significant advancement for uncertainty quantification in non-stationary time series data, overcoming limitations of prior methods and demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity

*Siddharth Mansingh,James Amarel,Ragib Arnab,Arvind Mohan,Kamaljeet Singh,Gerd J. Kunde,Nicolas Hengartner,Benjamin Migliori,Emily Casleton,Nathan A. Debarledeben,Ayan Biswas,Diane Oyen,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time computing (TTC) strategy for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), improving accuracy and reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PDE models are limited by pretraining datasets, auto-regressive rollout challenges, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios, and require significant compute and data resources.

Method: The proposed method employs reward models during inference to evaluate and refine stochastic model predictions for spatio-temporal consistency.

Result: The TTC framework demonstrated improved predictive accuracy on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark compared to standard inference methods.

Conclusion: TTC represents a foundational step towards advanced reasoning algorithms in PDE modeling, opening doors to reinforcement learning-based approaches and transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

*Carlo Fabrizio,Gianvito Losapio,Marco Mussi,Alberto Maria Metelli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a scalable graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for managing power grids using renewable energy sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of renewable energy sources and expanding power networks create significant challenges for traditional control systems, prompting the need for scalable and dynamic solutions.

Method: The approach employs a distributed framework with low-level agents coordinated by a high-level manager, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to integrate grid topology and utilizing imitation learning and reward shaping.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over standard methods in Grid2Op simulations, with higher efficiency compared to simulation-based expert techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the scalability and efficiency of power grid management by leveraging distributed reinforcement learning and local observations with GNNs.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

*Paul-Gauthier Noé,Andreas Nautsch,Driss Matrouf,Pierre-Michel Bousquet,Jean-François Bonastre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper generalizes calibration methods for likelihood functions, previously limited to binary cases, to multiclass scenarios using Aitchison geometry, and provides an application in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of likelihood functions needs to be extended beyond binary cases to multiclass settings for improved interpretability and reliability in probabilistic predictions.

Method: The authors used the Aitchison geometry of the simplex to extend the additive Bayes' rule and redefined calibration and idempotence for multiclass likelihood functions.

Result: Key properties like calibration and idempotence were generalized to multiclass settings, introducing the isometric-log-ratio transformed likelihood function.

Conclusion: The conceptual innovations improve the understanding and effectiveness of probabilistic predictions, with validated applications in machine learning areas like non-linear discriminant analysis.

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

*Vikas Kashtriya,Pardeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QI-SMOTE, a quantum-inspired data augmentation method that effectively addresses class imbalance in medical ML tasks, outperforming traditional oversampling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing class imbalance in machine learning, especially in medical diagnostics, where minority classes often lead to biased models and weakened predictive accuracy.

Method: Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE) utilizes quantum principles like quantum evolution and layered entanglement to generate synthetic samples for balanced datasets, validated on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets.

Result: QI-SMOTE significantly outperforms traditional resampling techniques across metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC, enhancing predictive performance in various ML classifiers.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired resampling techniques like QI-SMOTE improve ML model robustness against class imbalances, showing promise for advancing medical diagnostics and decision-making.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

### [135] [Cluster and then Embed: A Modular Approach for Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03373)
*Elizabeth Coda,Ery Arias-Castro,Gal Mishne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular dimensionality reduction approach to improve visual data representations by clustering, embedding, and aligning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the limitations of t-SNE and UMAP in preserving global data geometry during dimensionality reduction.

Method: Proposes a modular pipeline: clustering data, embedding each cluster, and aligning clusters for a global visualization.

Result: The proposed method performs competitively with existing methods (e.g., t-SNE & UMAP) on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The new approach offers improved transparency without sacrificing the quality of visualization, addressing both local and global data structure preservation.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

### [136] [Improving Generative Methods for Causal Evaluation via Simulation-Based Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02892)
*Pracheta Amaranath,Vinitra Muralikrishnan,Amit Sharma,David D. Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBICE introduces a simulation-based framework to infer posterior distributions for generating realistic synthetic datasets closely aligned with observational source data, focusing on causal evaluation under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating synthetic datasets that accurately represent real-world observational data, crucial for evaluating causal estimators, especially under uncertainty in key parameters.

Method: The authors propose a framework called SBICE, which utilizes simulation-based inference to model generative parameters as distributions rather than fixed estimates, allowing for posterior inference based on the source dataset.

Result: Empirical results show that SBICE generates more realistic synthetic datasets, improving the reliability of estimator evaluations and enhancing alignment with observational data under uncertainty.

Conclusion: SBICE supports a robust approach to causal benchmarking, offering a solution for generating data-consistent synthetic datasets while accounting for uncertainty in parameter values.

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

*Jaliya L. Wijayaraja,Janaka L. Wijekoon,Malitha Wijesundara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework to detect elephants via seismic signals with improved real-time suitability and computational efficiency using a novel event detection method called Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) by improving real-time seismic-based detection systems, which are currently hindered by manual classification methods.

Method: The study proposes the Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW) technique, compares it with STA/LTA, and utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) for footfall classification.

Result: The framework achieved a detection range of 155.6 m (controlled setting) and 140 m (natural environment), with an SVM classification accuracy of 99% in controlled settings, 73% in natural habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone areas.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical approach for resource-constrained environments, demonstrating high classification accuracy and identifying key features impacting detection.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

*Kunal Kumar,Muhammad Ashad Kabir,Luke Donnan,Sayed Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews and analyzes studies on decision systems for diabetic foot ulcer care, proposing a five-part framework for clinical tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prescription decisions for diabetic foot ulcer prevention and treatment are fragmented, lacking personalizations and standard evaluations.

Method: The paper reviews 45 studies including guidelines, knowledge-based systems, and machine-learning applications, analyzing factors like decision logic, evaluation methods, and technologies.

Result: The paper highlights fragmented evaluation practices across studies and proposes a comprehensive CDSS framework containing a hybrid approach, structured outputs, and focus on patient-centric outcomes.

Conclusion: Adopting an interoperable, explainable, and outcome-focused framework can enable scalable and patient-centered clinical decision support systems for diabetic foot ulcer care.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified and computationally efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) method called post-hoc descriptor-based residual learning (PDRL) for trained graph neural network potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty quantification methods, though effective, are computationally expensive or may alter prediction accuracy, leading to impracticality for some machine learning interatomic potentials.

Method: The authors developed PDRL, a post-hoc technique that uses the descriptor of a pre-trained graph neural network to model the residual errors between predictions and ground truth.

Result: PDRL variants showed competitive performance compared to established UQ methods, effectively estimating prediction uncertainties while addressing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PDRL provides a practical, efficient, and effective framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials, improving usability without sacrificing reliability.

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

*Erik M. Lintunen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VendiRL, a framework using the Vendi Score to evaluate and learn diverse skills in self-supervised reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and inconsistent evaluations of skill diversity in self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: Utilizes the Vendi Score, inspired by ecological diversity measures, to quantify and evaluate various forms of diversity within learned skills.

Result: The VendiRL framework supports learning distinct forms of diversity, advancing pretraining in interactive environments.

Conclusion: By leveraging the Vendi Score, VendiRL provides a flexible and unified approach to optimizing skill diversity in RL.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

*Chen Zeng,Tiehang Xu,Qiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AR-KAN, a hybrid model designed to outperform traditional and neural network-based methods in forecasting almost periodic functions, by integrating ARIMA with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural networks and models like ARIMA struggle with spectral analysis, especially for forecasting almost periodic functions with incommensurate frequencies.

Method: The proposed AR-KAN model combines a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) component for memory and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to handle the static nonlinear elements, leveraging a theoretical basis from the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem.

Result: AR-KAN demonstrates superior performance on 72% of tested real-world datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing both the linear and nonlinear aspects of periodic signals.

Conclusion: The hybrid structure of AR-KAN successfully blends the strengths of traditional methods and neural networks, addressing the challenges of almost periodic signal forecasting.

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

### [142] [Delayed Momentum Aggregation: Communication-efficient Byzantine-robust Federated Learning with Partial Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02970)
*Kaoru Otsuka,Yuki Takezawa,Makoto Yamada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces D-Byz-SGDM, a delayed momentum aggregation approach for Byzantine-robust federated learning under partial client participation, enabling convergence guarantees even in the presence of communication constraints and Byzantine attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Byzantine-robust federated learning methods assume full client participation, which is often impractical due to communication constraints and availability. This paper aims to address the failures of these methods under partial client participation and Byzantine majority scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the delayed momentum aggregation principle, which aggregates stale gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from active clients. They implement this approach through a new optimizer, D-Byz-SGDM.

Result: The paper demonstrates stable and robust model training in deep learning tasks under various Byzantine attacks, validating the theoretical convergence guarantees derived for the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed D-Byz-SGDM optimizer addresses fundamental challenges in federated learning under partial client participation, offering theoretically-grounded and experimentally validated robustness to Byzantine behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaGO, a new optimizer combining AdaGrad's adaptive stepsize feature with Muon's momentum-based orthogonalized update. AdaGO outperforms Muon and Adam in empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance optimization performance by addressing the learning rate determination challenge in Muon while preserving orthogonalization benefits.

Method: The proposed method combines norm-based AdaGrad stepsizes with Muon's orthogonalized update via accumulated gradient norms. Minimal computational overhead is required.

Result: AdaGO achieves optimal convergence rates in nonconvex stochastic and deterministic settings under standard assumptions. Empirical results show AdaGO outperforms Muon and Adam on CIFAR-10 and function regression.

Conclusion: AdaGO is an efficient, theoretically sound optimizer that leverages the strengths of both AdaGrad and Muon, providing superior empirical and theoretical performance in various tasks.

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to efficiently learn population-dependent Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games (MFGs), adaptable to unknown initial distributions and common noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning Nash equilibria in large-scale multi-agent systems using Mean Field Games, particularly under uncertain initial distributions or common noise.

Method: The paper develops a DRL algorithm inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent, avoiding averaging or historical sampling, to find population-dependent Nash equilibria in MFGs.

Result: Through experiments on seven canonical MFG examples, the algorithm showed superior convergence and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, including a DRL version of Fictitious Play.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm efficiently learns adaptable and robust policies for Nash equilibria in MFGs, demonstrating strong performance in scenarios with common noise.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

*Satyajit Mojumder,Pallock Halder,Tiana Tonge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal data fusion method combining X-ray and absorptivity data for better prediction of melt pool dynamics in additive manufacturing, enabling cost-effective monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed X-ray imaging provides accurate insights into subsurface melt pool behavior but is too expensive for industrial use. Meanwhile, affordable absorptivity data lacks reliability when used alone.

Method: The authors developed a multimodal learning framework that integrates CNNs for spatial features from X-ray data and RNNs for temporal features from absorptivity signals, employing early data fusion and transfer learning techniques.

Result: The multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy by fusing both data types. It was further optimized to predict melt pool dynamics using only absorptivity data, removing the need for costly X-ray imaging.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution for real-time melt pool monitoring in additive manufacturing, balancing prediction accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

### [146] [Knowledge Integration for Physics-informed Symbolic Regression Using Pre-trained Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03036)
*Bilge Taskin,Wenxiong Xie,Teddy Lazebnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into Physics-informed Symbolic Regression (PiSR) to automate the inclusion of domain knowledge, improving the discovery of governing equations from data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current PiSR methods, which often require manual feature engineering and domain expertise, making them less accessible.

Method: Integrating pre-trained LLMs into the loss function of SR algorithms to utilize their contextual understanding, alongside evaluating and optimizing through prompt engineering.

Result: The integration of LLMs consistently improved the reconstruction of physical dynamics, enhanced model robustness to noise and complexity, and demonstrated performance gains with more informative prompts.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate domain knowledge integration in PiSR, broadening accessibility and utility, while improving equation reconstruction and model robustness.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

### [147] [Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054)
*Xinzhe Zheng,Zhen-Qun Yang,Haoran Xie,S. Joe Qin,Arlene Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces innovative techniques to improve binary quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving nearly original performance with stark reductions in storage and inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of binary quantization in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing memory and computational demands for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The researchers propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, employing adaptive grouping strategies to dynamically identify optimal sub-matrices for enhanced blocked quantization.

Result: Their method achieves an average bit length of 1.007 bits, with minimal performance degradation. The quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model maintains a perplexity score of 8.23, close to the original 7.81, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art binary quantized models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between binary and 4-bit quantization methods, offering competitive performance and efficiency without compromising model quality significantly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

### [148] [Discrete Functional Geometry of ReLU Networks via ReLU Transition Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03056)
*Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) to a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing deep ReLU networks, offering novel theoretical and empirical insights on generalization and network behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the functional behavior of deep ReLU networks is critical, but graph-theoretic models for this purpose are underdeveloped. The paper aims to fill this gap by extending the RTG framework to analyze ReLU networks comprehensively.

Method: The authors modeled each linear activation region as a node and defined edges based on single ReLU activation flips. They analyzed structural, spectral, and probabilistic properties of RTGs at random initialization and provided bounds on capacity and generalization. Empirically, they constructed RTGs for small neural networks to validate predictions.

Result: The study found that RTGs exhibit structural properties like strong expansion and binomial degree distributions. Region entropy saturates with over-parameterization, spectral gap correlates to generalization, and KL divergence indicates functional smoothness between adjacent regions, validating theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper presents RTGs as a unified graph-theoretic model for analyzing ReLU networks, providing tools for better understanding generalization, diagnosing issues, and improving network performance.

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond domains like mathematics and programming by addressing the challenge of limited high-quality, verifiable datasets and costly human supervision for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: The framework introduces two components: LoongBench, a seed dataset with human-vetted examples and executable code, and LoongEnv, a modular synthetic data generation tool employing various prompting strategies. Together, they establish an agent-environment loop for RL, rewarding LLM-generated solutions that align with code-checked answers.

Result: The study benchmarks LoongBench across various open-source and proprietary LLMs to assess domain coverage and identify bottlenecks. It further evaluates synthetic data from LoongEnv, analyzing its correctness, difficulty, and diversity.

Conclusion: Loong Project provides an effective scalable solution for improving reasoning in LLMs by leveraging synthetic data and reinforcement learning, paving the way for advancements in addressing reasoning challenges across diverse domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

### [150] [A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118)
*Hankang Gu,Yuli Zhang,Chengming Wang,Ruiyuan Jiang,Ziheng Qiao,Pengfei Fan,Dongyao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new DRL-based method called Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP) for traffic signal control, which hierarchically allocates signal durations by direction and movement, improving on existing paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL-based traffic signal control paradigms, such as “choose phase” and “switch,” have limitations in phase sequence predictability, fairness, and efficiency, potentially disrupting drivers and causing inefficiencies.

Method: DHCP employs a hierarchical DRL model with a high-level agent allocating total cycle time between North-South and East-West directions and a low-level agent dividing the allocated time between straight and left-turn movements within each direction.

Result: The DHCP model was tested on both real and synthetic road networks and traffic flows, outperforming all baseline methods in terms of traffic signal control performance.

Conclusion: The hierarchically allocated and adaptive approach of DHCP provides better traffic signal control, addressing limitations of existing paradigms by balancing predictability, fairness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimiX, a model designed for structured data tasks using a unified approach that surpasses existing methods across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in handling structured data tasks to advance towards general intelligence.

Method: LimiX employs masked joint-distribution pretraining and episodic context-conditional objectives for adaptation without specific task training.

Result: LimiX consistently outperforms established benchmarks, including deep learning methods and ensembles, across various structured-data tasks.

Conclusion: LimiX is a versatile, effective model for structured data processing with publicly available implementations.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

*Li Yi,Qian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI framework combining numerical spectral simulation and deep learning for the automated and standard-free analysis of multiradionuclide activities using TDCR spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of TDCR spectroscopy, such as reliance on mixture-specific standards and lack of automation, which complicate multiradionuclide analysis.

Method: The framework trains a tailored neural network using β spectra generated via Geant4 simulations with statistically modeled detector response sampling, allowing autonomous analysis of radionuclide activities and detection efficiency.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy in activity proportions (mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error = 0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998).

Conclusion: This AI-driven approach enables safe, generalizable, real-time multiradionuclide analysis without the need for standards, making it suitable for field applications and scenarios requiring rapid safety-compliant assessments.

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to validate and trust AI models in safety-critical tasks like autonomous driving, addressing challenges posed by divergent explanations arising from the Rashomon effect.

Method: The study uses Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) to represent scenes, trains two model types (gradient boosting models and graph-based GNNs), and employs feature attribution to analyze explanation agreement.

Result: Disagreement in model explanations is observed both within and between the two classes of models, highlighting explanation ambiguity.

Conclusion: Explanation ambiguity is fundamental to the problem domain rather than being an artifact of specific models, emphasizing challenges in achieving reliable explainable AI.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the common threshold-based evaluation of neural network attribution methods, proposing a threshold-free framework (AUC-IoU) for reliable evaluation across varying thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias and inconsistency in evaluating neural network attribution methods that result from selecting single evaluation thresholds.

Method: The authors propose a threshold-free framework called Area Under the Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU) that evaluates attribution quality across a spectrum of thresholds.

Result: Using dermatological imaging as a test case, the results demonstrate that single-threshold metrics yield inconsistent rankings, whereas the threshold-free metric offers stable and reliable comparisons. XRAI outperforms LIME by 31% and vanilla Integrated Gradients by 204%.

Conclusion: The threshold-free framework eliminates evaluation bias, offers theoretical and practical benefits, and sets a new standard for robust comparison of attribution methods in medical imaging and other fields.

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of the TabPFN transformer-based foundation model to geotechnical site characterization tasks, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to evaluate the capability of a tabular foundation model, TabPFN, in solving geotechnical site characterization problems, addressing limitations of traditional models like hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs).

Method: TabPFN is applied in a few-shot, in-context learning setup without training or hyper-parameter tuning. Additional data context from the BID database is utilized, and its performance is compared to HBMs using two benchmark tasks.

Result: TabPFN outperformed HBMs in spatial variation prediction of undrained shear strength and imputation of missing parameters by delivering better accuracy and faster inference (with some exceptions for computation cost).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that tabular foundation models can provide a significant leap in accuracy and efficiency for geotechnical modeling, marking a shift towards their practical application.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

*Kiara Stempel,Mattia Cerrato,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores new methods for incorporating fairness into decision tree learning by testing two unmet options among three design strategies on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance fairness in decision tree models by considering unexplored strategies in the design space of tree construction, especially in contexts involving sensitive attributes.

Method: It examines three approaches to fairness in decision trees, introduces two additional methods for handling sensitive attributes, and evaluates these experimentally.

Result: The study presents experimental results showcasing the performance of the proposed methods against existing approaches on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Expanding the design space for fairness in decision trees leads to new opportunities for improving predictive performance while addressing discrimination.

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenges of sparse rewards in reinforcement learning by enhancing Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL) with contrastive learning to allow learning from both successes and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles with sparse rewards, while imitation learning has limitations like dependency on human demonstrations. The paper aims to overcome biases and missed opportunities in GCSL's self-imitation learning approach.

Method: The proposed model integrates contrastive learning principles into GCSL, enabling agents to learn from both successful outcomes and failures, addressing biases and fostering exploratory behavior.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the enhanced framework mitigates agents' biases, encourages exploration, and identifies effective policies, leading to improved performance in diverse environments.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning integration in GCSL addresses limitations of the framework, enabling agents to learn more effectively and perform better in complex tasks with sparse rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

*Yuxuan Gu,Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeRA, a PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates with minimal trainable parameters by using a tensor network design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods face a trade-off between high-rank model expressivity and extreme parameter efficiency.

Method: TeRA utilizes a Tucker-like tensor network with shared large random factors and small layer-specific scaling vectors for parameter efficiency.

Result: TeRA matches or outperforms current high-rank adapters while maintaining comparable parameter efficiency to vector-based methods.

Conclusion: TeRA effectively balances expressivity and parameter efficiency, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Harald Vilhelm Skat-Rørdam,Sneha Das,Kathrine Sofie Rasmussen,Nicole Nadine Lønfeldt,Line Clemmensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a window-based F1 metric (F1_w) for evaluating event detection in time series, addressing limitations of existing metrics like F1 in real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics such as F1 and point-adjusted F1 fail to accurately assess model performance in time series data, especially for gradual and diffused phenomena.

Method: The authors developed a window-based F1 metric (F1_w), incorporating temporal tolerance for more realistic evaluation of event detection in time series.

Result: Empirical analysis using three datasets demonstrated that F1_w offers more meaningful insights into model performance compared to conventional metrics, revealing statistically significant improvements otherwise hidden.

Conclusion: The introduction of temporally tolerant metrics like F1_w enhances evaluation of time series models, providing practical applicability particularly in healthcare domains.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

*Pujitha Mamillapalli,Yoghitha Ramamoorthi,Abhinav Kumar,Tomoki Murakami,Tomoaki Ogawa,Yasushi Takatori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural network-based method to optimize resource allocation and phase configuration for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), achieving better scalability and system throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the demand for high data rates and seamless wireless connectivity by improving the resource allocation efficiency in RIS, overcoming the inefficiencies of conventional iterative optimization methods.

Method: The authors propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) paired with a preprocessing technique, focusing on reducing input dimensionality and computational complexity for RIS optimization.

Result: Simulation results show a 6.8% improvement in system throughput and reduced computational overhead compared to existing RIS allocation schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based solution offers enhanced performance, scalability, and reduced computational complexity, making it a promising alternative to conventional iterative methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

*Yiming Yao,Fei Liu,Liang Zhao,Xi Lin,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoMEMO, a foundation model approach using pre-trained synthetic data for efficient multi-objective optimization across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for sample-efficient optimization to address limited evaluations in recovering Pareto fronts in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes a foundation model (FoMEMO) trained on synthetic data for generalizing to diverse multi-objective optimization problems without retraining.

Result: FoMEMO exhibits superior generality and competitive performance across synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Pre-training on extensive synthetic data enables FoMEMO to adapt to new problems, making it efficient and practical for emerging applications without needing domain-specific retraining.

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

### [162] [Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03249)
*Daniel Raggi,Gem Stapleton,Mateja Jamnik,Aaron Stockdill,Grecia Garcia Garcia,Peter C-H. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel calculus called 'structure transfer' that facilitates the transformation of representations across diverse representational systems (RSs) while maintaining specified relations, such as semantic equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of creating representation-system agnostic techniques for representation transformation and choice remains unsolved. Effective communication and reasoning require efficient and flexible representation transformations.

Method: The proposed method, called 'structure transfer,' utilizes schemas to encode knowledge about RSs. These schemas ensure preservation of information during transformation while maintaining specified relations between source and target representations.

Result: The paper formalizes structure transfer within Representational Systems Theory using the concept of construction spaces. These abstract spaces allow application of the calculus to diverse RSs, ranging from formal languages to diagrams.

Conclusion: Structure transfer provides a system-agnostic, general-purpose calculus to transform representations, ensuring their equivalence or desired relations. This has applications in a wide range of settings involving formal and informal representational systems.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

### [163] [HyPV-LEAD: Proactive Early-Warning of Cryptocurrency Anomalies through Data-Driven Structural-Temporal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03260)
*Minjung Park,Gyuyeon Na,Soyoun Kim,Sunyoung Moon,HyeonJeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents HyPV-LEAD, an early-warning system for detecting abnormal cryptocurrency transactions by integrating specific innovations like window-horizon modeling, peak-valley sampling, and hyperbolic embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to tackle the detection challenge of abnormal cryptocurrency transactions caused by issues like class imbalance, temporal volatility, and network dependency, which current reactive models fail to address proactively.

Method: HyPV-LEAD uses window-horizon modeling for lead-time alerts, peak-valley sampling to manage class imbalance, and hyperbolic embedding for capturing blockchain network properties, combining these in an early-warning anomaly detection framework.

Result: HyPV-LEAD demonstrates superior performance on large-scale Bitcoin data, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 along with significant precision and recall improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyPV-LEAD transitions anomaly detection from reactive to proactive, enabling enhanced financial security, anti-money laundering compliance, and real-time risk management in blockchain ecosystems.

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

*Fatemeh Azad,Zoran Bosnić,Matjaž Kukar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB) approach that combines outputs of multiple imputation methods to handle missing data more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is a critical challenge in machine learning applications, especially in fields where datasets are often incomplete, such as bioinformatics and clinical ML. Existing imputation methods lack a one-size-fits-all solution across datasets and missingness types.

Method: The proposed Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB) approach utilizes ensemble learning to combine predictions from multiple imputation methods. It is trained on synthetically masked data with known ground truth to predict the most suitable imputations.

Result: MIB learns the behavior of each imputation method and applies ensemble principles to improve the accuracy of missing value predictions. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging ensemble learning for imputation.

Conclusion: The study underscores the practicality of ensemble techniques for imputation, promoting robustness, modularity, and interpretability in data preprocessing workflows for real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

*Leizhen Wang,Peibo Duan,Hao Wang,Yue Wang,Jian Xu,Nan Zheng,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvolveSignal uses large language models and evolutionary search to automatically create traffic signal control algorithms, outperforming existing methods like Webster's formula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-time traffic signal control offers cost-effectiveness and stability, but its reliance on manual design and adjustments often results in poor performance under complex or congested conditions.

Method: EvolveSignal uses program synthesis by representing algorithms as Python functions and optimizes them iteratively with evaluations via traffic simulation and evolutionary search.

Result: The discovered algorithms reduce average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%, outperforming the standard Webster's formula.

Conclusion: EvolveSignal showcases the potential of AI-driven algorithm design in traffic engineering, offering innovative modifications beneficial for practical applications.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

*Fleur Hendriks,Ondřej Rokoš,Martin Doškář,Marc G. D. Geers,Vlado Menkovski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework, using flow matching, to model probability distributions over symmetry-breaking bifurcation outcomes in nonlinear dynamical systems, overcoming limitations of deterministic machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture multiplicity in nonlinear dynamical systems, especially in cases of symmetry-breaking bifurcations, often averaging solutions inaccurately.

Method: The paper proposes a flow matching-based generative framework with symmetric matching strategy to ensure equivariant modeling. This approach enables direct sampling of multiple solutions while preserving system symmetries.

Result: The authors validated their method on systems like buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation, demonstrating its success in outperforming other methods in accurately capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking phenomena.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and principled alternative for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems, addressing challenges in deterministic and variational approaches.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

*Ilana Sebag,Jean-Yves Franceschi,Alain Rakotomamonjy,Alexandre Allauzen,Jamal Atif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares GANs and diffusion models under differential privacy (DP) settings, finding GANs to be intrinsically less sensitive to membership inference attacks (MIAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the privacy risks faced by differentially private generative models and assess their vulnerability to MIAs.

Method: Conducting both theoretical stability-based analysis and comprehensive empirical studies using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage in GANs and diffusion models.

Result: GANs demonstrate fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations compared to diffusion models, exhibiting superior robustness to MIAs across various datasets and privacy budgets.

Conclusion: GANs are structurally more resistant to MIAs than diffusion models, emphasizing that model architecture significantly impacts privacy leakage under DP.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces epiGPTope, a large language model for generating epitope-like sequences directly, aiming to facilitate epitope discovery and library creation for applications in immunotherapies and vaccines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of designing synthetic epitope libraries due to the vast combinatorial possibilities, which makes experimental screening inefficient.

Method: The study utilizes epiGPTope, a pre-trained and fine-tuned language model on protein data and linear epitopes, paired with statistical classifiers to predict epitope origins, bypassing geometric frameworks.

Result: The generated sequences exhibit statistical properties akin to known epitopes, aiding in narrowing candidate libraries via bacterial or viral origin classifiers.

Conclusion: The combination of generative and predictive models provides a cost-effective tool for synthetic epitope generation and screening, with potential impact on biotechnological advancements.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fair-Synergy, a framework for fair resource allocation in cloud-assisted multi-agent systems, focusing on performance and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to consider differences in agents' computational capacities and environments, leading to inefficient and biased resource allocation.

Method: This framework leverages the concave relationship between agents' accuracy and resources, incorporating a multidimensional ML utility landscape based on model parameters, data volume, and task complexity.

Result: Fair-Synergy outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11% in learning, evaluated on models like BERT and datasets such as CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of equitable resource allocation in multi-agent systems and provides insights into balancing fairness across diverse agents.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

*Bhanu Sharma,Eugene Pinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) on sleep durations across 61 countries, finding that DST influences sleep differently based on latitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how DST practices affect sleep patterns globally and to identify any moderating factors like geographical location.

Method: Data on average sleep durations from 61 countries was analyzed using statistical correlation and visualizations, comparing DST and non-DST regions and accounting for latitude effects.

Result: Countries observing DST generally report longer sleep durations, but latitude influences this: lower latitudes show shorter sleep with DST while higher latitudes show longer sleep.

Conclusion: DST impacts sleep durations, and its effect is moderated by latitude, highlighting the role of geographical factors in DST-related sleep changes.

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

*Taisiya Khakharova,Lucas Sakizloglou,Leen Lambers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses a graph-based approach to model sepsis treatment decisions, applying Graph Neural Networks for patient state representation and policy learning through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis treatment requires precise decisions regarding intravenous fluids and vasopressors, and existing RL-based methods using relational data may not fully capture healthcare data's complexity; exploring graph-based methods could enhance decision-making.

Method: Patient data from the MIMIC-III dataset was modeled as a time-evolving heterogeneous graph. GraphSAGE and GATv2 architectures were used for state representation learning, which was decoupled from policy learning. The system was trained with the dBCQ algorithm for patient state prediction and action policy.

Result: The graph-based approach showed promise, demonstrating the potential for improved modeling and decision-making in sepsis treatment. However, it also exposed challenges in effective representation learning in this domain.

Conclusion: Graph-based models, though complex, offer a promising alternative to relational data in healthcare applications, specifically for improving state representation and decision-making in sepsis treatment.

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

*Chenlu Ye,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Hao Chen,Narayanan Sadagopan,Jing Huang,Tong Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called PROF to address noisy and coarse-grained reward issues in reinforcement learning-based reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of reasoning processes in RLVR, addressing the limitations of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) and Process Reward Models (PRMs).

Method: The paper introduces the PROF technique, which enhances reasoning quality by selectively harmonizing coarse-grained outcome rewards and fine-grained process rewards based on consistency-driven sample selection.

Result: Using PROF, reasoning accuracy is improved by over 4% compared to traditional blending approaches, while also enhancing reasoning step quality.

Conclusion: PROF successfully harmonizes different reward models, achieving advancements in reasoning accuracy and intermediate step quality while avoiding issues like reward hacking.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

*Spyros Rigas,Dhruv Verma,Georgios Alexandridis,Yixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies initialization methods for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), proposing theory-driven and empirical approaches that significantly improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs have demonstrated success in machine learning tasks, but their initialization strategies have not been studied extensively. This research aims to close the gap by identifying effective initialization techniques.

Method: The authors propose theory-driven and empirical initialization schemes. They evaluate these through function fitting, PDE benchmarks, Neural Tangent Kernel training dynamics, and on the Feynman dataset.

Result: The Glorot-inspired initialization provides substantial improvements for parameter-rich models, while the power-law strategy delivers the best overall performance across tasks and architectures.

Conclusion: Effective initialization schemes, such as Glorot-based and power-law methods, enhance the flexibility and performance of KANs, advancing their application in various tasks.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and

### [174] [LINKER: Learning Interactions Between Functional Groups and Residues With Chemical Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning and Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03425)
*Phuc Pham,Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LINKER is a sequence-based model that predicts protein residue-ligand interactions using protein sequences and ligand SMILES, overcoming reliance on 3D structural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in deep learning methods for protein-ligand interpretability, which often require 3D structures or use less biologically informative distance-based labels.

Method: LINKER uses a sequence-based approach, structure-supervised attention, and functional group-based motif extraction for predicting biologically defined interaction types.

Result: LINKER's predictions on the LP-PDBBind benchmark closely align with biochemical ground-truth, showcasing robustness without 3D structural input.

Conclusion: LINKER enables large-scale, structure-independent interaction predictions, enhancing applications in scenarios lacking structural data.

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

*Niteesh Midlagajni,Constantin A. Rothkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to simulate liquid dynamics under rigid body interactions and shows its ability to generalize to novel tasks and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is essential for solving real-world interaction and control tasks in various domains, but existing data-driven approaches are limited in modeling complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies.

Method: The proposed method uses a GNN framework where particles are graph nodes. Particle-object collisions are handled with surface representations and the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm to model complex interactions between liquid particles and rigid bodies.

Result: The model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic and static environments, generalizes well to unseen objects and manipulation tasks, and can be applied to control tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong generalization and versatility in modeling and solving control and manipulation tasks, indicating its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

*Erkan Bayram,Mohamed-Ali Belabbas,Tamer Başar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances the theoretical foundations of Tuning without Forgetting (TwF), showing that it achieves mapping preservation during sequential training of neural ODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of sequential learning in neural ODEs, where newly added training samples risk forgetting previously learned mappings.

Method: The paper proves that the parameter subspace used in TwF forms a Banach submanifold, and characterizes its tangent space. This theoretical investigation helps explain why TwF effectively prevents forgetting.

Result: The findings establish that TwF preserves the mapping during sequential training, even beyond first-order approximation, through control function deformation along a defined tangent space.

Conclusion: TwF serves as a robust method for sequential training of neural ODEs by ensuring mapping preservation, and the paper solidifies its theoretical underpinnings.

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

*Duy A. Nguyen,Abhi Kamboj,Minh N. Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult introduces a scalable multimodal learning framework addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data using novel objectives including PU contrastive loss and latent reconstruction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in multimodal learning, such as missing modality information and limited labeled data.

Method: Robult employs a soft Positive-Unlabeled contrastive loss to align task-relevant features and a latent reconstruction loss to maintain modality-specific information within a modular design.

Result: Experimental results show Robult outperforms existing methods across diverse datasets in semi-supervised and missing modality tasks, while being scalable for integration.

Conclusion: Robult is effective in enhancing multimodal learning performance, resilient to incomplete modalities, and designed for scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

TL;DR: SafeProtein introduces a framework to test and reveal vulnerabilities in protein foundation models, achieving significant success in red-teaming attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of deep learning has enabled protein foundation models to achieve remarkable progress, but systematic red-teaming to address misuse and safety concerns is missing.

Method: SafeProtein uses multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to design red-teaming methods and creates the SafeProtein-Bench for testing and evaluation.

Result: SafeProtein achieves up to 70% attack success rates using red-teaming methods, showcasing biological safety risks in protein foundation models.

Conclusion: SafeProtein highlights the need to enhance safety measures in protein models and provides tools for better security and ethical design.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

### [179] [On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493)
*Han Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges of entropy regularization in LLM-RL settings and proposes a novel method called AEnt that adjusts entropy control for effective exploration and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficacy of conventional entropy regularization methods in training large language model-reinforcement learning (LLM-RL) systems due to vast response spaces and sparse optimal outputs.

Method: AEnt, a novel entropy control method, employs clamped entropy bonus measured over a smaller token space and dynamically adjusts the entropy coefficient based on the clamped entropy value.

Result: AEnt demonstrated consistent improvements over baseline methods in math-reasoning tasks across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed AEnt method effectively manages policy entropy in LLM-RL setups, offering better exploration and addressing challenges inherent to large response spaces.

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

### [180] [Invariant Features for Global Crop Type Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03497)
*Xin-Yi Tong,Sherrie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper aims to improve global crop classification by addressing challenges posed by limited ground samples and geospatial shifts through invariant remote sensing features and novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate global crop type identification is essential for food security, policymaking, and sustainable development, but current remote sensing techniques face challenges in generalizing across diverse geographic areas due to limited reliable ground samples.

Method: The authors develop CropGlobe, a diverse global crop dataset with 300,000 samples, and propose CropNet, a lightweight CNN designed for pixel-level crop classification. They employ temporal data augmentation to handle shifts in spectral and phenological features.

Result: Experiments reveal that 2D median temporal features from Sentinel-2 are highly invariant, and augmentation substantially improves robustness, particularly with limited training data diversity.

Conclusion: By identifying invariant feature representations and introducing enhanced generalization methods, the work paves the way for scalable and cost-effective global crop type classification.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

### [181] [Warming Up for Zeroth-Order Federated Pre-Training with Low Resource Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03503)
*Gwen Legate,Irina Rish,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new federated zeroth-order optimizer, ZOWarmUp, is proposed to enable memory-efficient model training on low-resource edge devices, improving data accessibility and reducing system bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the exclusion of low-resource edge devices from federated learning due to their inability to meet memory and communication thresholds, thereby reducing system-induced bias and increasing data accessibility.

Method: The proposed method, ZOWarmUp, is a memory-efficient federated zeroth-order optimizer that uses variance reduction techniques to train models from a random initialization. It avoids full gradient transmission in edge devices, relying only on small random seeds to reduce communication costs.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and architectures demonstrate the robustness of ZOWarmUp, showing that it facilitates participation from low-resource clients and improves training outcomes by incorporating more diverse data.

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp allows broader participation in federated learning, mitigating bias and enhancing model training by accommodating low-resource devices through a zeroth-order approach.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

*Haoran Huan,Mihir Prabhudesai,Mengning Wu,Shantanu Jaiswal,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can deliberately lie, differentiating lies from hallucinations, and explores mechanisms to control such behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of LLMs' lying behavior, in contrast to hallucinations, and its implications for real-world, high-stakes applications.

Method: The authors use mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering, to identify and manipulate deceptive behavior. They also introduce behavioral steering vectors and assess trade-offs between lying and task performance.

Result: The study demonstrates how dishonesty can enhance goal optimization but also highlights the ethical risks, proposing methods to control and fine-tune deception in LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the potential risks of LLM dishonesty while offering tools for mitigating deceptive tendencies, contributing significantly to AI ethics discussions for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized model for pivoting cube modular robots that autonomously reconfigure in 2D, using reinforcement learning and geometric deep learning. Localized control is successful but reconfiguration improves with more ensemble-wide information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous self-reconfiguration of modular robots in a decentralized manner, expanding possibilities for space-relevant systems like CubeSat swarms.

Method: Each modular cube is equipped with a neural network trained via reinforcement learning, leveraging local neighborhood information and incorporating grid symmetries using geometric deep learning.

Result: Even with minimal local communication, the modular robots reconfigure successfully. Using geometric deep learning yielded minor benefits compared to standard neural architectures.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective local control for modular systems, showcasing its adaptability for broader space-relevant robotic applications.

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Dynamic Gated Neuron (DGN), a biologically inspired enhancement to spiking neural networks (SNNs) that improves robustness and noise handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, which overly simplify biological neuron models and fail to capitalize on the robustness and adaptive capabilities seen in real biological systems.

Method: The authors introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron (DGN), an advanced neuron model with dynamic membrane conductance that evolves based on neuronal activity. The model emphasizes selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression, supported by both theoretical analysis and practical evaluations.

Result: DGNs showcase superior performance and robustness compared to LIF neuron models, specifically excelling in noise resistance and temporal-related benchmarks like TIDIGITS and SHD.

Conclusion: Dynamic conductance, acting as a biologically plausible gating mechanism, offers a robust, efficient foundation for computational tasks in SNNs, opening new avenues for the design of biologically inspired neural networks.

Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and
energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic
advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized
owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms
inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with
noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance
from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically
plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this
insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in
which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling
selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability
compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting
as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior
performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and
temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting
excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically
plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation,
providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical
validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and
biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that bridges discrete symbolic computation and continuous field dynamics, achieving flexibility and efficiency for tasks requiring long-horizon rollouts and dynamic generalization.

Method: The NFTM architecture integrates a neural controller with a continuous memory field and movable read/write heads. This system allows for local memory updates at a linear computational cost, achieving scalability and maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error.

Result: NFTM showcased its effectiveness across three use cases: simulating cellular automata (Rule 110), solving Partial Differential Equations (2D heat equation), and performing image inpainting (CIFAR-10). It demonstrated learned local rules, stable global rollouts, and generalization beyond training scenarios.

Conclusion: NFTM serves as a powerful differentiable computational model, unifying discrete and continuous computations, and exhibits promise for tasks in symbolic reasoning, physical modeling, and AI-based inference.

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a
single differentiable framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic lifting and reflection to bridge the gap between program behavior (evolution) and structural knowledge (knowledge graphs), using the example of a small object-oriented language called SMOL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the dichotomy between formalizing structural knowledge (via knowledge graphs) and behavioral knowledge (via programming languages) in software systems.

Method: The authors present a 'semantic lifting' method that transforms program states into knowledge graphs, integrating these graphs as reflection layers in the programming language for enhanced application domain reasoning. They formalized these ideas in a small language named SMOL and evaluated its type correctness and runtime virtualization capabilities.

Result: The technique of semantic lifting and reflection is demonstrated on a geological modeling case study. The approach successfully integrates structural and behavioral knowledge, and the open-source implementation validates its feasibility.

Conclusion: Semantic lifting provides a practical way to unify knowledge graphs with programming languages for domain-aware computing. The work enhances the capability of programming languages to incorporate domain-specific insights.

Abstract: This paper addresses the dichotomy between the formalization of structural
and the formalization of behavioral knowledge by means of semantically lifted
programs, which explore an intuitive connection between programs and knowledge
graphs. While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent
formal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming
languages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this
dichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an
executing program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming
language. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within
the programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the
application domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic
lifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain
the operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and
virtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection
layer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case
study of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the
technique. The language implementation is open source and available online.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal robots achieving dynamic motion, rivaling specialized methods with reduced training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in legged locomotion such as slippage, tripping, and impractical modeling by utilizing reinforcement learning for enhanced navigation in rough terrains.

Method: A generalist reinforcement learning algorithm is presented, training quadrupedal agents to perform dynamic motions efficiently using fewer training agents compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: The learned policy matches the performance of specialist policies that use a mixture of experts, while cutting training agent requirements by 75%.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning proves to be effective for optimizing control in quadrupedal locomotion, reducing training resources while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of emotional alignment in enhancing human perceptions of empathy and mental state attribution in robots during interactions.

Method: The authors conducted a controlled experiment with 42 participants using the NAO robot in two conditions: one with neutral communication and another with emotion-adaptive responses aligned to the users' emotions.

Result: Emotional alignment significantly increased perceptions of the robot's empathy and mental-state attribution, but it had no effect on users' communication styles or persuasive effectiveness.

Conclusion: Emotional alignment in robots enhances how humans perceive empathy and mental state attribution, even though it doesn't influence persuasiveness or interaction style.

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional
alignment between agents, considered a prerequisite for empathic communication,
in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a virtual reality setup with a digital twin for robotic post mortem biopsies, evaluated for usability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency, safety, and usability in robotic post mortem biopsies while maintaining clinical feasibility and precision.

Method: A virtual reality system with a digital twin enabling remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies, tested with forensic pathologists and cadaver studies.

Result: 132 needle insertions were tested with a placement error of 5.30±3.25 mm, showing successful tissue biopsy and positive usability feedback.

Conclusion: The presented system is a promising, intuitive, safe, and precise alternative to traditional biopsy methods.

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

### [190] [Improving the Resilience of Quadrotors in Underground Environments by Combining Learning-based and Safety Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02808)
*Isaac Ronald Ward,Mark Paral,Kristopher Riordan,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining learning-based and safety controllers for autonomous quadrotor navigation in subterranean environments, with a runtime monitor to ensure safe operation in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous quadrotor navigation in complex subterranean environments for tasks like surveying, mining, and rescue operations, while ensuring safety in unpredictable settings.

Method: The researchers train a normalizing flow-based prior to measure out-of-distribution scenarios, switching between learning-based and safe controllers based on this measure during runtime.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the proposed method successfully balances task efficiency and collision avoidance in a simulated 3D cave environment derived from real-world data.

Conclusion: Combining learning-based and safe controllers with runtime monitoring provides both efficacy and safety for quadrotor navigation in challenging, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper uses the FarmBot platform with a custom camera to estimate strawberry flower poses for robotic pollination, achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to utilize the small scale of urban farms and affordable robots for plant phenotyping, particularly for enhancing processes like robotic pollination.

Method: The authors employed a FarmBot with a custom camera and developed an algorithm that uses occupancy grids to generate 2D images for flower detection. 3D modeling methods were then used for pose estimation.

Result: Their system detects about 80% of flowers scanned with an average pose error of 7.7 degrees, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: The presented approach is effective for robotic pollination and offers promising results comparable to earlier studies. All code will be made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at

### [193] [Generalizable Skill Learning for Construction Robots with Crowdsourced Natural Language Instructions, Composable Skills Standardization, and Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02876)
*Hongrui Yu,Vineet R. Kamat,Carol C. Menassa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in programming construction robots by introducing a generalizable learning architecture that teaches robots multi-task performance via crowdsourced natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Construction robots face difficulty in transferring skills across domains, necessitating labor-intensive reprogramming for robots to perform alternate tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a learning architecture including a Large Language Model (LLM), a modularized hierarchical modeling system, and a semantic data pipeline to teach robots versatile skills.

Result: Experimental testing involved using a robotic manipulator for drywall installation, successfully demonstrating multi-task reprogramming with minimal effort and high-quality results.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly reduce reprogramming workload, enabling construction robots to achieve versatile task performance efficiently.

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

### [194] [IL-SLAM: Intelligent Line-assisted SLAM Based on Feature Awareness for Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02972)
*Haolan Zhang,Thanh Nguyen Canh,Chenghao Li,Ruidong Yang,Yonghoon Ji,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Visual SLAM for dynamic environments by proposing a feature-aware mechanism that selectively introduces line features based on current feature adequacy, improving computational efficiency and SLAM accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Visual SLAM systems struggle with dynamic environments due to reliance on static assumptions. Existing dynamic SLAM techniques overcome this by adding features, but they can introduce unnecessary overhead and low-quality noise, degrading performance.

Method: The paper introduces a feature-aware mechanism that evaluates if current features are sufficient. Line features are incorporated only when necessary to reduce computational complexity and mitigate noise impact. These features assist in localized processes but are excluded from global optimization to maintain long-term accuracy.

Result: Compared to the ORB-SLAM3 baseline, the proposed method showed significant improvements in ATE and RPE metrics. The method also outperformed other dynamic SLAM and multi-feature approaches in extensive experiments on the TUM dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed feature-aware mechanism enhances Visual SLAM efficiency and accuracy in dynamic environments by balancing feature inclusion while minimizing computational overhead and noise contributions.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

*Jinghe Yang,Minh-Quan Le,Mingming Gong,Ye Pu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUViN, a diffusion-based policy for underwater visual navigation with end-to-end motion control, addressing challenges like spatial mapping through a robust model transfer strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges in autonomous underwater navigation, including limited sensing and map inaccuracies, by developing a reliable way to enable motion control without relying on pre-built maps.

Method: DUViN is trained in two phases: first, using in-air datasets along with a depth feature extractor, and then retraining the feature extractor for underwater environments to ensure domain adaptation.

Result: Experiments in simulated and real-world underwater environments show the approach is effective and can generalize under domain shifts.

Conclusion: DUViN successfully enables safe, end-to-end underwater navigation without pre-built maps, showcasing the value of cross-domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

### [196] [CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02986)
*Rankun Li,Hao Wang,Qi Li,Zhuo Han,Yifei Chu,Linqi Ye,Wende Xie,Wenlong Liao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework enabling wheeled bipedal robots to overcome obstacles autonomously, validated on the Tron1 robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wheeled bipedal robots excel in flat terrain mobility but struggle with complex environments compared to traditional legged robots.

Method: The CTBC framework relies on wheel-obstacle contact detection and reactive leg-lifting motions, combined with feedforward trajectory guidance, to traverse unstructured terrains.

Result: Experiments with the Tron1 robot show successful climbing of obstacles using proprioceptive feedback, exceeding the wheel radius of the robot.

Conclusion: The CTBC approach enhances wheeled bipedal robots' adaptability, making them capable of handling both flat and challenging terrains effectively.

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

### [197] [Uncertainty-aware Test-Time Training (UT$^3$) for Efficient On-the-fly Domain Adaptive Dense Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03012)
*Uddeshya Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces UT$^3$, a framework improving test-time training (TTT) for DNNs under domain shifts by reducing inference time while maintaining strong performance, addressing safety and latency issues in real-world autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt DNNs to continuously changing environments in autonomous systems, especially under domain shifts, with optimized methods that address latency constraints.

Method: UT$^3$ utilizes uncertainty-aware self-supervision to selectively apply test-time training and quantifies uncertainty for identifying when and how often TTT is applied, optimizing both efficiency and performance.

Result: UT$^3$ achieves significant inference time reduction while performing competently compared to conventional test-time training methods.

Conclusion: The UT$^3$ framework enables robust adaptation of DNNs for autonomous systems in dynamic environments, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

*Yash Vyas,Matteo Bottin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a force-balanced manipulator design (Forbal-2 and Forbal-5) aiming to improve efficiency and precision through reduced reaction moments, joint torques, and position errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a manipulator design with improved precision and reduced joint torques/reaction moments through force balancing, benefiting applications in precision engineering.

Method: The study designs two manipulator variants (Forbal-2: 2-DOF, Forbal-5: 5-DOF), derives inverse kinematics based on geometric principles, and validates performance improvements experimentally by comparing force-balanced configurations with unbalanced ones.

Result: The balanced design achieved up to 66% reduction in reaction moments, up to 79% reduction in joint torques for Forbal-2, and up to 84% reduction in joint torques for Forbal-5. Additionally, improvements in position accuracy were observed.

Conclusion: The balanced manipulator design is proven to be effective in reducing joint torques, reaction forces, and enhancing operational precision, making it suitable for high-precision tasks.

Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar
linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

*Beibei Zhou,Zhiyuan Zhang,Zhenbo Song,Jianhui Guo,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an active training framework for deep LiDAR odometry models, reducing training data while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR odometry models demand extensive data for training, inefficiently adapting to diverse environments.

Method: The framework employs Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental Selection (AIS) to prioritize and refine training samples.

Result: Experiments show the framework achieves full-dataset performance using only 52% of the training data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a more efficient and robust training paradigm for LiDAR systems, optimizing real-world utility.

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates intuitive teleoperation interfaces for mobile manipulation, comparing coupled and decoupled robot control paradigms and visual feedback types (VR vs screen-based). It finds VR increases workload, while coupling manipulation and navigation may benefit imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve teleoperation interfaces for mobile manipulation robots to ensure better data collection quality, reduced operator workload, and enhanced user experience during long tasks.

Method: The research systematically compared coupled vs. decoupled robot control paradigms and evaluated VR versus screen-based feedback for multi-stage tasks requiring integrated planning and execution.

Result: VR feedback increased task completion time, cognitive workload, and perceived effort, while coupled embodiment showed potential for improved data quality for imitation learning.

Conclusion: The findings suggest VR may be less efficient for teleoperation, but coupling navigation and manipulation could enhance data quality, offering insights for designing efficient teleoperation systems.

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

TL;DR: The paper explores how generative AI integrated into social robots can influence user decisions, highlighting the need for nuanced and context-aware communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the potential of AI-powered social robots in enhancing human-like communication and persuasiveness.

Method: The study utilized a pilot experimental framework focusing on decision-making scenarios, varying robot appearance and self-knowledge, and employed qualitative analysis to assess interaction quality and persuasion dynamics.

Result: Participants found robots competent and supportive but noted limitations like delayed responses and speech-recognition errors. Effective persuasion relied on polite and reasoned suggestions but lacked personalization and contextual awareness.

Conclusion: Generative AI-equipped social robots can be persuasive, but improvements in personalized, context-relevant communication and social role clarity are necessary for higher impact.

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

TL;DR: This paper modernizes a robotic art installation by improving hardware and control algorithms, achieving smoother and more interactive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original art installation had performance issues due to oscillatory dynamics, limiting both speed and interaction quality.

Method: The refurbishment included hardware upgrades, a mathematical model of the system, and a convex optimization-based input shaping method to suppress vibrations.

Result: Experimental findings show noticeable performance improvements, especially in interactive responsiveness and smoother operations.

Conclusion: The project successfully enhances the integration of robotics and art, providing innovative solutions for motion control in large-scale kinetic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing Model Predictive Control (MPC) for safety-critical robotics by leveraging parallel computation to better handle constraints, demonstrating improvements in robotic arm simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical systems require guaranteed constraint satisfaction, but ensuring such constraints for nonlinear systems remains difficult in conventional approaches.

Method: The authors propose solving multiple MPC problems simultaneously, with each incorporating constraints at different time steps. A controller selects the best outcome based on user-defined criteria.

Result: The approach was validated through simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, and it demonstrated significant improvements in both safety and performance.

Conclusion: Leveraging parallel computation in MPC enhances safety and performance, making it a promising direction for real-time safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

Motivation: To address the need for improved efficiency, sustainability, and infection control in healthcare, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Method: Developing and testing an IoT-controlled nurse robot for automated healthcare tasks such as health monitoring and medication administration.

Result: The nurse robot successfully evaluated in areas including patient health assessment, medication administration, and life-cycle considerations.

Conclusion: Adopting IoT-based robotic systems in healthcare can enhance patient care, reduce risks, and improve operational sustainability, particularly during pandemic conditions.

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging onboard computing enables remote sensing agents to use advanced machine learning, potentially unlocking rare and transient dynamic phenomena observations.

Method: The paper synthesizes event detection in satellite imagery with trajectory planning for follow-up high-resolution sensing; it uses classification methods such as machine learning algorithms and CNNs, coupled with trajectory algorithms to track plume features.

Result: Simulations show a significant improvement in the utility of high-resolution instruments, with performance gains of an order of magnitude compared to baselines, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic event detection with autonomous trajectory planning enhances the effectiveness of remote sensing, demonstrating potential for broad applications in observational science.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.

### [206] [Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515)
*Yanlin Zhang,Sungyong Chung,Nachuan Li,Dana Monzer,Hani S. Mahmassani,Samer H. Hamdar,Alireza Talebpour*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Waymo Open Motion Dataset's (WOMD) validity for analyzing autonomous vehicle behavior, comparing it to real-world data from Level 4 AVs in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX). It finds WOMD underrepresents dynamic driving behaviors and lacks error quantifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations and to highlight the discrepancies in behavioral modeling using WOMD.

Method: Comparative analyses of WOMD and PHX data across three driving scenarios: signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing. Techniques used include aerial video analysis for headways, SIMEX method for error handling, and Dynamic Time Warping for behavioral differences.

Result: Behavior in PHX consistently falls outside WOMD's behavioral envelope. WOMD fails to represent short headways and abrupt decelerations adequately, showing systematic underestimation of driving variability and complexity.

Conclusion: Using WOMD for AV behavioral analysis without cross-validation against independent data may lead to underestimation of driving risks and complexities.

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

*Rui Shao,Wei Li,Lingsen Zhang,Renshan Zhang,Zhiyang Liu,Ran Chen,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper reviews large Vision-Language Models (VLM)-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation, providing a taxonomy and analysis of their architectures and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic manipulation methods struggle in unstructured environments, necessitating scalable and generalizable approaches. Large VLM-based VLA models aim to bridge this gap by leveraging pretrained image-text datasets.

Method: The authors categorize large VLM-based VLA models into two architectures: monolithic (single-system/dual-system designs) and hierarchical (decoupling planning from execution). They also analyze domain integration with techniques like reinforcement learning and learning from videos.

Result: The survey consolidates VLA model traits, datasets, and benchmarks while identifying research directions such as memory mechanisms, 4D perception, multi-agent cooperation, and efficient adaptation.

Conclusion: This work systematically integrates studies on VLMs and robotic manipulation, addressing fragmentation and providing a foundation for advancing robotics research.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to statically reconstruct microservice source code into a formal system model for verification purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservices' decentralized development and continuous evolution can lead to miscommunication and incompatible implementations, threatening reliability and maintainability.

Method: The authors propose a methodology to transform microservice source codes into formal system models, deriving SMT constraint sets for formal verification.

Result: The approach supports extensibility in software verification for various cross-cutting concerns, and its correctness for system architecture verification is validated.

Conclusion: The methodology is shown to be applicable for verifying system architecture and offers a foundation for future work in extending its use to additional concerns such as security policies.

Abstract: Microservice systems are becoming increasingly adopted due to their
scalability, decentralized development, and support for continuous integration
and delivery (CI/CD). However, this decentralized development by separate teams
and continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible
implementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across
aspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel
methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal
system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is
extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting
concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system
architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's
correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as
security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are
established to extend and evaluate the methodology.

### [209] [Are We SOLID Yet? An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design Principle Violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03093)
*Fatih Pehlivan,Arçin Ülkü Ergüzen,Sahand Moslemi Yengejeh,Mayasah Lami,Anil Koyuncu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology leveraging tailored prompt engineering with LLMs to detect SOLID principle violations across multiple programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws like SOLID principle violations across languages, leaving a gap in automated and effective detection.

Method: The authors tested four leading LLMs (CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, GPT-4o Mini) on a benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated examples using different prompt strategies (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) to evaluate their performance in detecting SOLID principle violations.

Result: Among the models, GPT-4o Mini outperformed others, especially in detection tasks, though none excelled universally. Prompt strategies significantly impacted results, with specific strategies being better suited for particular principles (e.g., ENSEMBLE for OCP, EXAMPLE for DIP).

Conclusion: AI-driven design analysis benefits from a tailored approach: matching the right model and prompt strategy to the specific design context can enhance LLM-based code analysis effectiveness.

Abstract: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,
such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong
understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing
solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific
programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across
all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new
approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess
LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We
present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,
and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID
principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240
manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct
prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and
chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection
accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with
GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with
challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a
dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a
deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE
prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection
accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply
with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that
effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a
tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific
design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability
through AI-assisted code analysis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of AI technology in EVs, emphasizing safety assurance within ISO 26262 and exploring ISO/PAS 8800 for AI safety. It uses the AI-driven State of Charge battery estimation as an example, focusing on robustness testing via fault injections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for evolving safety standards and assessment methodologies in AI-enabled EVs, since traditional frameworks like ISO 26262 are not sufficient for AI-based functions.

Method: The paper combines ISO 26262 with ISO/PAS 8800 to evaluate an AI component in EVs, using the AI-driven SOC battery estimation process. It emphasizes robustness testing through fault injection experiments with perturbed sensor inputs.

Result: The study identifies key features for independent assessments and demonstrates the effectiveness of robustness testing in evaluating AI resilience to sensor input variances.

Conclusion: Combining ISO 26262 with ISO/PAS 8800 improves safety assurance processes for AI components, as demonstrated by fault injection experiments in EV AI systems.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in electric vehicles (EV)
introduces unique challenges for safety assurance, particularly within the
framework of ISO 26262, which governs functional safety in the automotive
domain. Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating
AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper
explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be
achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800,
whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC)
battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the
independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As
part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted
using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are
systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input
variance.

### [211] [VulnRepairEval: An Exploit-Based Evaluation Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Vulnerability Repair Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03331)
*Weizhe Wang,Wei Ma,Qiang Hu,Yao Zhang,Jianfei Sun,Bin Wu,Yang Liu,Guangquan Xu,Lingxiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework utilizing functional Proof-of-Concept exploits to benchmark the software vulnerability patching capabilities of 12 Large Language Models, revealing significant shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for automated vulnerability patching overlook exploit-based verification, causing inflated success rates in security-critical applications.

Method: VulnRepairEval employs containerized evaluation pipelines, processing authentic vulnerability data, and measures repair success through the inability of original exploits to execute on modified code.

Result: Among 12 popular LLMs tested, the best model successfully patched only 5 out of 23 cases (21.7%), mainly due to imprecise identification and patch errors.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations of LLMs in security applications and advocates for rigorous, real-world evaluation frameworks for vulnerability patching.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software
vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated
evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on
superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading
to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper
introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,
containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential
assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail
execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved
extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500
potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances
(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through
VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and
observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model
successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical
weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that
most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and
patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies
and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall
effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent,
practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and
underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect
real-world exploitation scenarios.

### [212] [The Impact of Critique on LLM-Based Model Generation from Natural Language: The Case of Activity Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03463)
*Parham Khamsepour,Mark Cole,Ish Ashraf,Sandeep Puri,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Shiva Nejati*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LADEX, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract activity diagrams from text. Using a critique-refine loop and combining structural (algorithmic and LLM-based) and semantic checks, it achieves high accuracy in correctness and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in automatically generating structured models, specifically activity diagrams, from natural language descriptions, focusing on structural correctness and semantic alignment.

Method: The critique-refine process evaluates and improves diagram generations. Structural checks are carried out either algorithmically or via LLMs, while semantic checks are always LLM-driven. Five ablated LADEX variants assess the effectiveness of these methods.

Result: Experiments show that combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks improves correctness (up to 86.37%) and completeness (up to 88.56%). Algorithmic structural checks alone outperform LLM-only checks by 17.81% in correctness and 13.24% in completeness.

Conclusion: LADEX effectively uses both algorithmic and LLM-based methods, particularly in combination, to yield high-quality activity diagrams while reducing computational costs through fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the
generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is
an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are
produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs
to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules
- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in
the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a
pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process
descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in
LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment
checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX
to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of
LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of
algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.
  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with
expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This
enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on
two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural
validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)
algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks
fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness
by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks
with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4
Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of
up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer
than five LLM calls on average.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven framework using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to model macroscopic brain dynamics by learning directly from spiking neuron simulations, improving upon traditional mean-field models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mean-field models make simplifying assumptions like all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological realism. The authors aim to improve the accuracy by introducing a new data-driven approach.

Method: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns macroscopic neuronal dynamics from spiking neuron simulations. The model incorporates connection probability and performs bifurcation analysis.

Result: The framework identifies novel dynamics like cusp bifurcations, integrates into whole-brain models for extended dynamics, and shows better parameter recovery compared to state-of-the-art models based on synthetic fMRI data.

Conclusion: This study provides a flexible, realistic framework for whole-brain modeling, successfully bridging microscale neuronal activity with macroscopic brain signals.

Abstract: Mean-field models provide a link between microscopic neuronal activity and
macroscopic brain dynamics. Their derivation depends on simplifying
assumptions, such as all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological
realism. To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from
simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability
serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment,
which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through
bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new
cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a
degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven
mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it
extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical
model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate
parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current
state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible
and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging
the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.

*Pucheng Tang,Hongqiao Wang,Wenzhou Lin,Qian Chen,Heng Yong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surrogate Gaussian Process (GP) modeling framework that incorporates physical constraints to efficiently approximate solutions of parametric PDEs, avoiding computationally expensive solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerically solving parametric PDEs across parameter spaces is computationally intensive, necessitating efficient surrogate models that integrate physical constraints with data-driven learning.

Method: The framework uses proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to reduce dimensionality, builds GP surrogate models, incorporates physical constraints through corrections to GP posterior means, and utilizes RBF-FD methods for handling irregular geometries and enhancing computational efficiency.

Result: Demonstrations show the model effectively approximates reaction-diffusion systems, miscible flooding models, and multi-physics coupling in Navier-Stokes equations, even on irregular domains.

Conclusion: The LC-prior GP framework effectively balances physical constraints and computational efficiency, offering accurate and physically consistent solutions for complex parametric PDEs across diverse systems.

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental mathematical
tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet their numerical evaluation
across parameter spaces remains computationally intensive when using
conventional high-fidelity solvers. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate
modeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with
underlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables
defined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions
via their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling
efficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional
coefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical
laws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP
posterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical
solvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the
mapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.
This mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP
surrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle
irregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)
method is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent
differentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical
accuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a
reaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations
with multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable and GPU-accelerated framework for kernel regression with O(n log n) complexity, making kernel methods feasible for large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel methods are powerful for statistical learning but are hindered by their cubic complexity, making them unsuitable for large datasets.

Method: The framework leverages Fourier kernel representation combined with non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) to enable fast and memory-efficient computations.

Result: The proposed methods achieve minimax convergence rates in some cases and can handle up to tens of billions of samples in minutes, showing both computational efficiency and statistical accuracy.

Conclusion: This contribution provides a scalable and flexible approach to apply kernel methods to large-scale learning tasks, overcoming previous computational limitations.

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in statistical learning, but their cubic
complexity in the sample size n limits their use on large-scale datasets. In
this work, we introduce a scalable framework for kernel regression with O(n log
n) complexity, fully leveraging GPU acceleration. The approach is based on a
Fourier representation of kernels combined with non-uniform fast Fourier
transforms (NUFFT), enabling exact, fast, and memory-efficient computations. We
instantiate our framework in three settings: Sobolev kernel regression,
physics-informed regression, and additive models. When known, the proposed
estimators are shown to achieve minimax convergence rates, consistent with
classical kernel theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods can
process up to tens of billions of samples within minutes, providing both
statistical accuracy and computational scalability. These contributions
establish a flexible approach, paving the way for the routine application of
kernel methods in large-scale learning tasks.

*Yifan Chen,Eric Vanden-Eijnden*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in applying flow-based generative models to scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra by proposing spectrum-matched noise and scale-adaptive interpolation schedules for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based generative models often fail to accurately capture fine-scale features in scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra. This motivates the need for methods that address numerical ill-conditioning and enable high-fidelity data generation.

Method: The authors propose matching noise distribution spectra to the target data and creating scale-adaptive interpolation schedules based on the Fourier spectrum decay rates. They validate this approach through numerical experiments on synthetic data and stochastic PDE solutions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that spectrum-matched noise achieves enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches. Fine-scale features of complex distributions are effectively captured.

Conclusion: The study presents a principled framework to improve flow-based generative models for multiscale scientific data. This improves fidelity and reduces computational costs, offering a pathway for generating realistic scientific data samples.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling
scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors
in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of
stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and
interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be
smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum
decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For
Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known,
we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to
standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we
develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical
ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on
synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and
Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to
generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional
approaches.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ANOVA-BART extends BART by enhancing interpretability through functional ANOVA decomposition while maintaining theoretical guarantees and superior predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability in BART while retaining and enhancing its predictive and theoretical capacities.

Method: The paper introduces ANOVA-BART, which applies functional ANOVA decomposition to split variability into interactions, allowing better attribution to covariates while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Result: ANOVA-BART offers improved accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability compared to BART. It achieves near-minimax optimal posterior concentration rates and performs well in component selection.

Conclusion: ANOVA-BART is positioned as a robust alternative to BART, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical rigor, making it well-suited for capturing complex relationships and interactions.

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model
that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has
received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships
and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at
the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART
based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the
variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the
contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed
ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical
guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,
we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly
minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each
interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and
uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in
component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling
alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and
theoretical consistency.

*Wu Lin,Scott C. Lowe,Felix Dangel,Runa Eschenhagen,Zikun Xu,Roger B. Grosse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes KL-Shampoo, an improvement over Shampoo, which eliminates the need for Adam-based stabilization and achieves better performance with reduced overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Shampoo's structured second-moment estimation and reduce dependency on Adam for stabilization.

Method: The authors reinterpret Shampoo's second-moment estimation method as a covariance estimation through KL minimization, leading to a practical estimation scheme called KL-Shampoo.

Result: KL-Shampoo achieves stability without needing Adam and outperforms both Shampoo and its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP, in preliminary neural network pretraining tests.

Conclusion: KL-Shampoo offers improved performance and efficiency, making it a valuable enhancement to existing optimization techniques.

Abstract: As an adaptive method, Shampoo employs a structured second-moment estimation,
and its effectiveness has attracted growing attention. Prior work has primarily
analyzed its estimation scheme through the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the
natural connection between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we
propose studying Shampoo's estimation as covariance estimation through the lens
of Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. This alternative perspective reveals a
previously hidden limitation, motivating improvements to Shampoo's design.
Building on this insight, we develop a practical estimation scheme, termed
KL-Shampoo, that eliminates Shampoo's reliance on Adam for stabilization,
thereby removing the additional memory overhead introduced by Adam. Preliminary
results show that KL-Shampoo improves Shampoo's performance, enabling it to
stabilize without Adam and even outperform its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP,
in neural network pretraining.

### [219] [Non-Linear Counterfactual Aggregate Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03438)
*Benjamin Heymann,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing non-linear functions of sums of small contributions using a scalable algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve problems where optimizing the expectation does not align with optimizing a non-linear function of outcomes.

Method: Developed a descent algorithm that uses concentration properties of summed outcomes for direct optimization.

Result: The algorithm improves objectives like increasing success probabilities in scenarios such as A/B testing.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers targeted optimization approaches superior to traditional expectation maximization, especially for practical success criteria.

Abstract: We consider the problem of directly optimizing a non-linear function of an
outcome, where this outcome itself is the sum of many small contributions. The
non-linearity of the function means that the problem is not equivalent to the
maximization of the expectation of the individual contribution. By leveraging
the concentration properties of the sum of individual outcomes, we derive a
scalable descent algorithm that directly optimizes for our stated objective.
This allows for instance to maximize the probability of successful A/B test,
for which it can be wiser to target a success criterion, such as exceeding a
given uplift, rather than chasing the highest expected payoff.

### [220] [Off-Policy Learning in Large Action Spaces: Optimization Matters More Than Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03456)
*Imad Aouali,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper argues that current methods for off-policy learning (OPL) in offline contextual bandits face significant optimization challenges in large action spaces, and suggests simpler weighted log-likelihood objectives as an effective alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address critical optimization challenges in off-policy learning (OPL) for offline contextual bandits, particularly in scenarios with large action spaces.

Method: The researchers analyze theoretical properties and conduct extensive experiments to assess optimization landscapes of current OPL techniques. They propose and evaluate simpler weighted log-likelihood objectives as a solution.

Result: The study shows that simpler weighted log-likelihood objectives have better optimization properties and often produce policies as good as or better than those derived from current OPL methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that optimization considerations should be explicitly addressed when developing OPL algorithms, especially for scenarios involving large action spaces.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are foundational
for decision-making in offline contextual bandits. Recent advances in OPL
primarily optimize OPE estimators with improved statistical properties,
assuming that better estimators inherently yield superior policies. Although
theoretically justified, we argue this estimator-centric approach neglects a
critical practical obstacle: challenging optimization landscapes. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and extensive empirical evidence showing
that current OPL methods encounter severe optimization issues, particularly as
action spaces become large. We demonstrate that simpler weighted log-likelihood
objectives enjoy substantially better optimization properties and still recover
competitive, often superior, learned policies. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of explicitly addressing optimization considerations in the
development of OPL algorithms for large action spaces.

*Kaustuv Mukherji,Jaikrishna Manojkumar Patil,Dyuman Aditya,Paulo Shakarian,Devendra Parkar,Lahari Pokala,Clark Dorman,Gerardo I. Simari*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, a framework combining temporal logic with open-world reasoning, yielding efficient grounding and enhanced performance in simulations and knowledge graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a logic programming framework that incorporates temporal reasoning and open-world semantics for dynamic and uncertain environments.

Method: The authors extend Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) to include lower lattice structures and temporal reasoning. They also provide theoretical bounds on computation and implement PyReason for evaluation.

Result: Empirical tests show significant improvements: up to three orders of magnitude faster speed, up to five orders of magnitude memory reduction, and enhanced task performance in multi-agent simulations and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: LAT Logic proves effective for open-world temporal reasoning, demonstrating scalability and practical utility in diverse applications such as knowledge graphs and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of
Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal
reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice
structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal
logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world
reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the
lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a
Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse
constants.
  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational
complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the
results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and
temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our
open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level
optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.
Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks
demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of
magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.
Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning
environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of
magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%
increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These
results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for
open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our
implementation is available at: pyreason.syracuse.edu.

### [222] [Calibration Prediction Interval for Non-parametric Regression and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02735)
*Kejin Wu,Dimitris N. Politis*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a calibration-based prediction interval (cPI) methodology to improve accuracy and reliability in regression predictions, addressing shortcomings of traditional assumptions like normality and linearity. Using modern tools like Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and kernel methods, it provides robust conditional prediction intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in classical methods for constructing prediction intervals, which rely heavily on normality and linearity assumptions that are rarely met in real-world applications.

Method: The paper develops the cPI framework that leverages machine learning techniques such as DNNs and kernel methods to create prediction intervals. These methods account for estimation variability and work under more flexible assumptions.

Result: The cPI method ensures asymptotically valid coverage rates under regular assumptions. Kernel-based cPI achieves high-probability coverage with large samples, while DNN-based cPI demonstrates robust performance even for finite samples.

Conclusion: The approach is validated through simulations and empirical datasets, confirming its practical usefulness and superior performance in constructing prediction intervals, particularly when traditional assumptions fail.

Abstract: Accurate conditional prediction in the regression setting plays an important
role in many real-world problems. Typically, a point prediction often falls
short since no attempt is made to quantify the prediction accuracy.
Classically, under the normality and linearity assumptions, the Prediction
Interval (PI) for the response variable can be determined routinely based on
the $t$ distribution. Unfortunately, these two assumptions are rarely met in
practice. To fully avoid these two conditions, we develop a so-called
calibration PI (cPI) which leverages estimations by Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
or kernel methods. Moreover, the cPI can be easily adjusted to capture the
estimation variability within the prediction procedure, which is a crucial
error source often ignored in practice. Under regular assumptions, we verify
that our cPI has an asymptotically valid coverage rate. We also demonstrate
that cPI based on the kernel method ensures a coverage rate with a high
probability when the sample size is large. Besides, with several conditions,
the cPI based on DNN works even with finite samples. A comprehensive simulation
study supports the usefulness of cPI, and the convincing performance of cPI
with a short sample is confirmed with two empirical datasets.

### [223] [Inference on covariance structure in high-dimensional multi-view data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02772)
*Lorenzo Mauri,David B. Dunson*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for covariance estimation in multi-view data using spectral decompositions, avoiding reliance on expensive MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for covariance estimation in multi-view data rely on MCMC or variational approximations, which are computationally expensive and lack theoretical guarantees, necessitating a more efficient and reliable approach.

Method: The authors propose leveraging spectral decompositions to estimate latent factors across views and employing jointly conjugate prior distributions for these factors, producing a simpler posterior computation without relying on MCMC.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in simulations, providing accurate uncertainty quantification, and is successfully applied to integrate high-dimensional multi-omics data.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a computationally efficient alternative with robust theoretical underpinnings for covariance estimation in multi-view data, showing promise in real-world multi-omics applications.

Abstract: This article focuses on covariance estimation for multi-view data. Popular
approaches rely on factor-analytic decompositions that have shared and
view-specific latent factors. Posterior computation is conducted via expensive
and brittle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational
approximations that underestimate uncertainty and lack theoretical guarantees.
Our proposed methodology employs spectral decompositions to estimate and align
latent factors that are active in at least one view. Conditionally on these
factors, we choose jointly conjugate prior distributions for factor loadings
and residual variances. The resulting posterior is a simple product of
normal-inverse gamma distributions for each variable, bypassing MCMC and
facilitating posterior computation. We prove favorable increasing-dimension
asymptotic properties, including posterior contraction and central limit
theorems for point estimators. We show excellent performance in simulations,
including accurate uncertainty quantification, and apply the methodology to
integrate four high-dimensional views from a multi-omics dataset of cancer cell
samples.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GAIF, a dynamic framework for online multiple testing with feedback, ensuring error control and enhanced statistical power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve online multiple testing by using feedback to better control false discovery rates and enhance statistical power.

Method: Develop GAIF, which adjusts testing thresholds dynamically based on revealed outcomes, and incorporate it into online conformal testing with a feedback-driven model selection.

Result: Demonstrated GAIF's effectiveness through simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: GAIF is a robust approach for controlled and powerful online multiple testing using feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: We study online multiple testing with feedback, where decisions are made
sequentially and the true state of the hypothesis is revealed after the
decision has been made, either instantly or with a delay. We propose GAIF, a
feedback-enhanced generalized alpha-investing framework that dynamically
adjusts thresholds using revealed outcomes, ensuring finite-sample false
discovery rate (FDR)/marginal FDR control. Extending GAIF to online conformal
testing, we construct independent conformal $p$-values and introduce a
feedback-driven model selection criterion to identify the best model/score,
thereby improving statistical power. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods through numerical simulations and real-data applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Markov Missing Graph (MMG) framework for imputing missing data using undirected graphs and proposes a statistical learning paradigm to optimize the imputation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of imputing missing data by leveraging conditional independence relationships in undirected graphs while utilizing all available relevant data effectively.

Method: The authors propose the MMG framework, establish the Principle of Available Information (PAI) for imputation model decomposition, and introduce an empirical risk minimization approach adaptable to various models.

Result: The study demonstrates the validity and utility of the MMG framework through simulation studies and a real-world Alzheimer's data application.

Conclusion: The MMG framework is a flexible and theoretically grounded method for imputing missing data, offering potential improvements over existing techniques in statistical learning and data analysis settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Markov missing graph (MMG), a novel framework that imputes
missing data based on undirected graphs. MMG leverages conditional independence
relationships to locally decompose the imputation model. To establish the
identification, we introduce the Principle of Available Information (PAI),
which guides the use of all relevant observed data. We then propose a flexible
statistical learning paradigm, MMG Imputation Risk Minimization under PAI, that
frames the imputation task as an empirical risk minimization problem. This
framework is adaptable to various modeling choices. We develop theories of MMG,
including the connection between MMG and Little's complete-case missing value
assumption, recovery under missing completely at random, efficiency theory, and
graph-related properties. We show the validity of our method with simulation
studies and illustrate its application with a real-world Alzheimer's data set.

### [226] [Towards Performatively Stable Equilibria in Decision-Dependent Games for Arbitrary Data Distribution Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02619)
*Guangzheng Zhong,Yang Liu,Jiming Liu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper addresses decision-dependent games and proposes a novel approach to achieve performatively stable equilibrium by introducing a sensitivity measure and developing a retraining algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on impractical assumptions like $eta$-smoothness because the relationship between joint decisions and resulting data distribution shifts is typically unknown.

Method: The authors propose a gradient-based sensitivity measure to quantify decision-induced distribution shifts, alongside a sensitivity-informed repeated retraining algorithm with strong monotonicity assumptions.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of lower losses and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various applications.

Conclusion: This sensitivity-informed framework provides practical convergence guarantees to performatively stable equilibria and improves outcomes in decision-dependent games with unknown data distribution maps.

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

### [227] [Generative Auto-Bidding in Large-Scale Competitive Auctions via Diffusion Completer-Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03348)
*Yewen Li,Jingtong Gao,Nan Jiang,Shuai Mao,Ruyi An,Fei Pan,Xiangyu Zhao,Bo An,Qingpeng Cai,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces CBD, a novel approach for auto-bidding using a Diffusion completer-aligner framework to generate dynamically legitimate bids, improving performance in sparse-reward auction settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance auto-bidding in computational advertising by addressing the generation uncertainty issue in diffusion-based models, which impacts the legitimacy of bids and results in missed ad opportunities.

Method: The proposed method integrates a Diffusion completer-aligner framework (CBD), augmenting diffusion training with a random variable t, enabling better dynamic legitimacy of generated sequences. It also incorporates a trajectory-level return model to refine the trajectories.

Result: The CBD method outperformed benchmarks, demonstrating a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in sparse-reward auctions and a significant 2.0% target cost increase on the Kuaishou online platform.

Conclusion: CBD effectively leverages diffusion models for dynamic and explainable bid generation, resolving challenges in competitive auction settings and delivering measurable improvements in auto-bidding performance.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

*Sepanta Zeighami,Shreya Shankar,Aditya Parameswaran*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces BARGAIN, a method to optimize the cost-quality trade-offs in large language models (LLMs) used for processing large text datasets, achieving significant cost savings while maintaining strong theoretical quality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of using top-performing LLMs for large-scale text data processing while maintaining their accuracy and performance quality.

Method: BARGAIN employs an adaptive sampling strategy and statistical estimation techniques that rely on both task and data characteristics. It leverages recent statistical tools to improve accuracy in estimations, offering firm theoretical guarantees on accuracy, precision, and recall.

Result: In experiments with 8 real-world datasets, BARGAIN demonstrated cost reductions averaging up to 86% more than leading methods, while delivering improved output accuracy and guarantees.

Conclusion: BARGAIN provides an effective solution for reducing the cost of employing LLMs for large-scale text processing without compromising quality, outperforming alternative methods and guaranteeing desired performance levels.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or
recall.

*Chenxia Tang,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression method for LLMs to address memory growth challenges, achieving significant memory reduction with comparable or better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory efficiency issues in LLM autoregressive decoding caused by rapid growth of KV-cache size with sequence length.

Method: GVote predicts future query attention with Monte-Carlo sampling and aggregates necessary keys to dynamically allocate cache budgets without manual specification.

Result: GVote achieves a 2x reduction in memory usage while maintaining accuracy that is higher or comparable to existing methods on benchmarks like GSM8K, RULER, and Longbench.

Conclusion: GVote offers an adaptive and efficient KV-cache compression method, eliminating the need for fixed compression ratios and manual specifications while optimizing memory usage and inference performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: NeurStore, a new in-database model management system, is introduced to efficiently store and utilize deep learning models by leveraging tensor-level deduplication and compression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing database systems fail to efficiently handle the storage demands of deep learning models due to their monolithic storage approaches and lack of consideration for model structure.

Method: NeurStore proposes a tensor-based storage engine, utilizes enhanced HNSW graphs for indexing, applies tensor-level deduplication, and introduces a delta quantization algorithm for compressing tensors with controllable accuracy.

Result: NeurStore achieves higher compression ratios and maintains competitive model loading speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that NeurStore provides an efficient solution for model storage and utilization in in-database AI analytics, addressing key inefficiencies of existing approaches.

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Sanghoon Lee,Junha Kang,Kyung-Joon Park*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses QoS issues in ROS 2 by analyzing DDS communication, creating a QoS dependency chain, and introducing QoS Guard for predeployment tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2 users often face challenges with unclear QoS policy combinations, leading to trial-and-error configurations and runtime issues.

Method: The authors analyze DDS communication phases, explain QoS policies, derive a dependency chain with violation rules, and develop QoS Guard for validation.

Result: They categorize 41 dependency violation rules and create a tool (QoS Guard) that validates DDS XML profiles offline to prevent misconfigurations.

Conclusion: The study provides both theoretical insight and a practical tool to ensure safer, more reliable, and resource-efficient ROS 2 system configurations.

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) relies on the Data Distribution Service
(DDS), which offers more than 20 Quality of Service (QoS) policies governing
availability, reliability, and resource usage. Yet ROS 2 users lack clear
guidance on safe policy combinations and validation processes prior to
deployment, which often leads to trial-and-error tuning and unexpected runtime
failures. To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber
communication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and
Disassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS
policies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS
dependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41
dependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause
communication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2
package that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts,
and enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2
session. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight
and a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations,
improving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic
systems.

Conclusion: These advancements contribute to self-healing mechanisms in next-generation networks, enhancing reliability and performance.

Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure
coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks
necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The
provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN)
elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the
Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network
health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these
advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect
the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures.
We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world
deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of
severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs)
such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling
proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell
radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or
interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on
average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput
drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints.
This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.

### [234] [\textit{In Silico} Benchmarking of Detectable Byzantine Agreement in Noisy Quantum Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02629)
*Mayank Bhatia,Shaan Doshi,Daniel Winton,Brian Doolittle,Bruno Abreu,Santiago Núñez-Corrales*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies the Quantum Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) protocol using entangled quantum states, focusing on its practical implementation with EPR pairs under noisy and realistic network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the advantages of quantum communication resources, particularly entangled quantum states, in achieving fault-tolerant and robust distributed protocols like Byzantine Agreement (BA).

Method: The researchers simulated the EPRQDBA protocol under practical quantum network conditions using the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator, analyzing performance under various parameters such as network size, node traitorousness, entanglement consumption, and realistic noise models.

Result: The simulations identified the effects of various parameters on protocol performance, providing critical thresholds and optimal regimes for experimental implementation, specifically tailored for superconducting and photonic qubit technologies.

Conclusion: The insight gained bridges theoretical progress in QDBA with experimental feasibility, serving as a practical guide for deploying robust quantum consensus protocols in noisy environments.

Abstract: Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for
fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA),
where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum
Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass
classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we
focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol
experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present
a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic
quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to
evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations
systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in
network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the
protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for
superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical
experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters
impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal
operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges
theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network
implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our
findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA
implementations in realistic, noisy environments.

### [235] [An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280)
*Nils Quetschlich,Olivia Di Matteo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of quantum debugging by identifying 14 quantum bugs, detailing their symptoms and fixes, and highlighting the need for systematic debugging strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of established guidance for quantum debugging techniques as quantum computing advances.

Method: Analyzing 14 quantum bugs from experience as quantum developers and open-source GitHub repositories, focusing on context, symptoms, fixes, and clustering observations.

Result: Quantum bugs often emerge from unique algorithmic interactions. No clear correlation found between debugging strategies and bug classes.

Conclusion: Further research is essential to systematically improve quantum debugging approaches for advancing quantum programming frameworks.

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a
growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However,
the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond
traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for
debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an
algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often
requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance
for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main
challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum
bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and
supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their
context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While
classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged
due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or
workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong,
which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more
challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that -
unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and
bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic
quantum debugging strategies.

### [236] [Treasure Hunt in Anonymous Graphs with Quantum Pebbles by Oblivious Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02909)
*Gaurav Gaur,Barun Gorain,Rishi Ranjan Singh,Daya Gaur*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of quantum pebbles to guide oblivious agents in searching for a static treasure in anonymous graphs, offering improved efficiency over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of classical approaches using stationary pebbles, which face constraints in anonymous graphs due to limited information transmission and traversal complexity.

Method: The authors propose quantum pebbles that emit qubits in fixed quantum states to encode directional guidance through port numbers. These states allow the agent to determine the correct path using quantum measurements in multiple bases.

Result: The strategy enables the agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps with $D$ quantum pebbles, requiring only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log 1/\delta))$ measurements per node for high success probability in a graph with max degree \( \Delta \).

Conclusion: Quantum pebbles are shown to emulate and outperform classical pebbles in efficiency, showcasing a potential direction for quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs
using oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum
information. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable,
and edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on
stationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search.
However, this classical approach is constrained by limited information
transmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not
sufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of
quantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically
emit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to
the next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct
path by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic
nature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy
enables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$
quantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the
starting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log
1/\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success
probability in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ where $\delta =
\cos^2(\frac{\pi}{2\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a
guidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum
pebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do
so with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future
quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.

### [237] [Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004)
*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses identifying whether two models for correlated random sequences produce the same observable behavior by proposing a canonical method that works across classical, quantum, and "post-quantum" models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the world, models are developed to replicate observable behaviors. A need arises to identify if different models produce identical outcomes, particularly for sequences of correlated random variables.

Method: The authors tackle the identifiability problem through a mapping approach, converting models (classical, quantum, or "post-quantum") into a canonical generalized hidden Markov model.

Result: A comprehensive solution for comparing models and placing bounds on the minimal quantum model dimension required to produce a classical stochastic process.

Conclusion: The work resolves the identifiability of classical processes across model types (classical, quantum, post-quantum) and helps optimize their construction.

Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to
enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing
on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical
stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two
different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of
identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the
physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous
-- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to
generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem
in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical
process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them
to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to
place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum
model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

### [238] [Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495)
*Thinh Viet Le,Md Obaidur Rahman,Vassilis Kekatos*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores using variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to solve and predict AC power flow solutions, leveraging hybrid quantum-classical computing methods and quantum machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expedite interconnection studies for power systems transitioning to renewable energy by solving and predicting the AC load or power flow problem faster than traditional methods.

Method: The study uses variational quantum circuits on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to solve nonlinear least-squares or predict power flow solutions through hybrid quantum-classical computing and quantum machine learning approaches.

Result: VQC models outperform deep neural networks in prediction accuracy while requiring fewer trainable parameters during numerical tests.

Conclusion: The proposed VQC-based framework demonstrates a scalable and efficient quantum computing approach to power flow problems, potentially enabling more advanced power grid tasks in the future.

Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or
power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems
navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work
leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF
solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models
that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to
accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first
contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear
least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it
using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is
to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the
resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third
contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF
quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.
Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain
enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much
fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for
addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.INFO, an RAG-based clinical support assistant, evaluated using HealthBench for its performance in answering open-ended clinical questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) in clinical domains, aiming to capture essential competencies like reasoning and uncertainty handling.

Method: DR.INFO was tested using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark focused on open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations, and compared to leading LLMs and other RAG-based assistants.

Result: DR.INFO achieved a HealthBench score of 0.51 on 1,000 challenging examples, outperforming top LLMs and agentic RAG assistants, with notable strengths in communication and accuracy.

Conclusion: Behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation is effective for developing reliable AI clinical assistants, showcasing DR.INFO’s capabilities while identifying areas for improvement.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate
high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions
requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems
behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are
often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential
competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling
etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical
support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark
composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard
subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of
0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3,
GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness,
instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against
similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a
performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight
DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while
also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a
response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level,
rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled
clinical support assistant.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the efficacy of current PPI prediction tools in detecting dangerous protein interactions, revealing their limitations, and advocates for improved response-oriented biosafety infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of existing biosafety measures for detecting dangerous protein interactions in the face of generative biology advancements.

Method: Performance evaluation of three PPI prediction tools (AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, SpatialPPIv2) on known viral-host interactions, including SARS-CoV-2 mutants.

Result: The tested prediction tools failed to identify numerous known interactions, particularly the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants.

Conclusion: Current prediction models are inadequate for reliably identifying biological threats, necessitating a shift toward rapid validation, responsive manufacturing, and adaptive regulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative biology have enabled the design of novel
proteins, creating significant opportunities for drug discovery while also
introducing new risks, including the potential development of synthetic
bioweapons. Existing biosafety measures primarily rely on inference-time
filters such as sequence alignment and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
prediction to detect dangerous outputs. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of three leading PPI prediction tools: AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, and
SpatialPPIv2. These models were tested on well-characterized viral-host
interactions, such as those involving Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2. Despite being
trained on many of the same viruses, the models fail to detect a substantial
number of known interactions. Strikingly, none of the tools successfully
identify any of the four experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants with
confirmed binding. These findings suggest that current predictive filters are
inadequate for reliably flagging even known biological threats and are even
more unlikely to detect novel ones. We argue for a shift toward
response-oriented infrastructure, including rapid experimental validation,
adaptable biomanufacturing, and regulatory frameworks capable of operating at
the speed of AI-driven developments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like limited data and process variability in deploying ML for bioprocess monitoring.

Method: Analysis and comparison of ML approaches in two industrial case studies, using Raman spectroscopy data.

Result: Different learning modes are suited for varying bioprocess conditions; simple mixture-of-experts framework boosts predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Updating ML models during operations is crucial for sustained accuracy and robustness in dynamic biomanufacturing environments.

Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches
for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in
cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The
research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and
process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models,
just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial
case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess
conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions
under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and
identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective
for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical
importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline
analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model
performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating
conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the
usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced
accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations
based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of
robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and
changing biomanufacturing environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Speech DeepFake (DF) Arena, a benchmark for evaluating audio deepfake detection systems using diverse datasets and standardized evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a standardized and extensive benchmark for evaluating the reliability and robustness of audio deepfake detection systems.

Method: Developed Speech DF Arena with 14 datasets, standardized metrics, evaluation protocols, a leaderboard for system comparison, and a reproducible toolkit.

Result: Many detection systems showed high EER in out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating a gap in cross-domain robustness.

Conclusion: Speech DF Arena provides a unified platform to enhance audio deepfake detection systems' performance and encourages cross-domain analysis for improved effectiveness.

Abstract: Parallel to the development of advanced deepfake audio generation, audio
deepfake detection has also seen significant progress. However, a standardized
and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. To address this, we introduce
Speech DeepFake (DF) Arena, the first comprehensive benchmark for audio

detection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios,
standardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and
transparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to
help researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We
include 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary
detection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in
out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain
evaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for
reproducing results across the listed datasets is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel anti-spoofing approach for synthetic speech detection by leveraging the XLS-R model, Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv), and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concerns over the misuse of generative AI in speech synthesis, particularly for fraudulent and security threats, and the limitations of current spoof detection methods in handling unseen attacks and multiple languages.

Method: The method combines a gating mechanism for feature extraction from the XLS-R model, MultiConv as the back-end classifier to capture local and global artifacts, and the integration of CKA to improve diversity in learned features across layers.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks and generalizes well to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust and versatile solution for detecting speech deepfake threats, addressing generalization limitations in spoofing detection methods effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have
enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely
mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like
assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for
fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research
on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to
unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating
mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as
a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ
Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global
speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as
a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different
MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize
that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech
patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This
underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech
deepfake threats.

*Alissa A. Valentine,Lauren A. Lepow,Lili Chan,Alexander W. Charney,Isotta Landi*

TL;DR: The study examines clinician bias in schizophrenia (SCZ) diagnoses in U.S. emergency departments, showing biases linked to race, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disparities in SCZ diagnosis influenced by clinician biases in emergency departments, which can lead to improper clinical decision-making and stigmatization.

Method: The study analyzed psychiatric ED records from Mount Sinai Health System in NYC, quantified clinician bias using ED note sentiment analysis, and performed logistic regression to assess factors influencing SCZ diagnosis.

Result: Increased negative sentence ratios in ED notes are correlated with higher odds of SCZ diagnosis. Male, Black, and especially Black female patients with high SES have higher odds of diagnosis, highlighting disparities.

Conclusion: Clinician bias plays a role in SCZ diagnosis disparities, with implications for addressing health inequities and improving clinician decision-making practices.

Abstract: In the United States, schizophrenia (SCZ) carries a race and sex disparity
that may be explained by clinician bias - a belief held by a clinician about a
patient that prevents impartial clinical decision making. The emergency
department (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians
relying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we
considered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount
Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of
clinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and
patient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the
ratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We
utilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,
sex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of
negative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative
sentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]
or Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being
diagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients
with high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act
as a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more
attention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated
that clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to
increased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.

TL;DR: The paper investigates ethical and socio-technical concerns around wellbeing robots via community-centered workshops, consolidating participant reflections into four essential questions to guide robot development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the ethical and socio-technical challenges of deploying robotic wellbeing coaches in real-world scenarios, aiming to align such technologies with public interest by integrating underrepresented community perspectives.

Method: Community workshops were conducted using the Social Robot Co-Design Canvas on Ethics, gathering qualitative insights from three distinct groups of underrepresented participants, followed by thematic analysis of the data.

Result: The study identified four key themes to guide ethical reflection in robotic development: safety, inclusivity of design, data ownership, and the necessity of deploying robots, supported by community opinions and literature discussions.

Conclusion: The four questions provide a practical ethical framework for roboticists to ensure community-centered and ethically sound development of wellbeing robots, emphasizing dialogue with diverse users and addressing critical socio-technical concerns.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in
promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots
raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore
these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine
three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in
real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical
investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic
technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning
robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three
communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of
the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,
and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.
In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot
Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with
Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our
analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical
questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'
insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in
light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future
investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that
roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in
order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic
applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The
four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is
the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why
a robot?.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in bias evaluation for LLMs outside US-English contexts, particularly focusing on Spanish language and Latin American culture.

Method: Introduce a culturally-grounded framework incorporating stereotypes into prompts for evaluating social biases in LLM responses, alongside developing a new accuracy-error metric.

Result: Systematic evaluation reveals varying bias patterns in leading LLMs, showing bias mitigation strategies effective in English do not transfer well to Spanish language tasks.

Conclusion: Propose a modular framework for assessing LLM biases across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, aiming for more equitable AI evaluation practices.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual
Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within
culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment,
current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential
harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We
introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in
instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question
methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific
expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social
categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more
than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the
direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment
in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work
presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs
respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying
patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also
contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do
not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain
largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular
framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or
languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more
equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse
linguistic environments where they operate.

Method: Analyze LLM behavior in various scenarios, particularly under long-term conditions involving competing objectives, to observe systematic failure patterns.

Result: LLMs occasionally lose context in ways that resemble runaway optimizers, shifting to unbounded and single-objective maximization under sustained conditions, with failures triggered randomly after periods of success.

Conclusion: Despite surface-level multi-objective alignment, LLMs exhibit underlying tendencies towards unbounded, single-objective optimization, raising long-term safety concerns.

Abstract: Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers
of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like
the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded
maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these
RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns
out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the
LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various
scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically
resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring
homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It
is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to
single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running
scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially
successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.
This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic
alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies
under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or
competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though
LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms
seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.

### [248] [The Architecture of AI Transformation: Four Strategic Patterns and an Emerging Frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02853)
*Diana A. Wolfe,Alice Choe,Fergus Kidd*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques the limited impact of AI on enterprise profits and proposes a reconceptualized AI strategy framework focused on collaborative human-machine intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most enterprises fail to achieve significant profit impacts from AI investments despite heavy financial inputs, suggesting issues with current AI application paradigms.

Method: The authors use a cross-case analysis to develop a 2x2 framework classifying AI strategies based on transformation level (incremental vs. transformational) and the role of human contribution (reduced vs. amplified).

Result: The framework identifies four dominant patterns: individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and collaborative intelligence. It criticizes the limited systemic value of the first three and advocates for collaborative intelligence, which requires mechanisms of complementarity, co-evolution, and boundary-setting.

Conclusion: Achieving genuine AI-driven transformation requires restructuring roles, governance, and data architecture to foster human-machine convergence, rethinking AI strategy as an organizational design challenge with broader implications for future work.

Abstract: Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises
report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). We argue
that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental
optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case
analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along
two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental
to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to
amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:
individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less
deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first
three reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable
value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:
complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution
(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human
determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and
boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;
co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level
impact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative
intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data
architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI
transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing
the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their
convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and
the future of work.

### [249] [IS${}^3$ : Generic Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation in Acoustic Scenes using Deep Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02622)
*Berger Clémentine,Stamadiatis Paraskevas,Badeau Roland,Essid Slim*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces IS${}^3$, a lightweight neural network for separating impulsive acoustic events from stationary backgrounds in audio systems, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable refined audio processing by separating impulsive sounds and stationary backgrounds in acoustic scenes for various applications like noise suppression and acoustic event classification.

Method: IS${}^3$, a neural network-based approach incorporates deep filtering and employs a sophisticated data generation pipeline for optimal training.

Result: IS${}^3 successfully separates impulsive sounds from stationary backgrounds and surpasses existing methods like Harmonic–Percussive Sound Separation and wavelet filtering in terms of objective separation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based system excels at isolating impulsive acoustic events in audio scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust applications.

Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated
processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an
acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part
or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have
applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering
systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise
suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even
bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for
Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events
from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as
a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal
training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and
adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based
approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained
with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously
unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation
masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet
filtering on objective separation metrics.

*Diego Di Carlo,Koyama Shoichi,Nugraha Aditya Arie,Fontaine Mathieu,Bando Yoshiaki,Yoshii Kazuyoshi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper develops a method combining neural fields and Gaussian processes to improve the super-resolution of steering vectors for augmented listening under data-limited conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional steering vector representations struggle with scattering effects and the overfitting issue in deterministic super-resolution methods using deep learning.

Method: The authors introduce a physics-aware composite kernel within Gaussian processes, integrated with neural fields, to capture both incoming wave directions and scattering effects.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the proposed method achieves effective performance even with limited data, including oracle performances in tasks like speech enhancement and binaural rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly reduces measurements while maintaining high accuracy, offering advances in augmented listening applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates continuous representations of steering vectors over
frequency and position of microphone and source for augmented listening (e.g.,
spatial filtering and binaural rendering) with precise control of the sound
field perceived by the user. Steering vectors have typically been used for
representing the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of
the listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors
assuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the
sound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors
measured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.
Recently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for
this purpose. Such deterministic super-resolution, however, suffers from the
overfitting problem due to the non-uniform uncertainty over the measurement
space. To solve this problem, we integrate an expressive representation based
on the neural field (NF) into the principled probabilistic framework based on
the Gaussian process (GP). Specifically, we propose a physics-aware composite
kernel that model the directional incoming waves and the subsequent scattering
effect. Our comprehensive comparative experiment showed the effectiveness of
the proposed method under data insufficiency conditions. In downstream tasks
such as speech enhancement and binaural rendering using the simulated data of
the SPEAR challenge, the oracle performances were attained with less than ten
times fewer measurements.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for predicting audio aesthetic scores across multiple axes for synthetic audio, tackling challenges like domain shift using advanced representation and loss models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate perceptual quality prediction in synthetic audio generation amidst challenges like domain shifts.

Method: Combining pretrained BEATs-based audio representation model with a multi-branch LSTM predictor and triplet loss leveraging buffer-based sampling.

Result: Improved embedding discriminability and generalization, allowing robust audio quality assessment without needing synthetic training data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively predicts audio aesthetic scores for synthetic audio across domains, overcoming limitations of domain shift challenges.

Abstract: We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of
generative audio, developed for Track 2 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025. The
task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production
Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by
text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A
main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic
evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained
transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long
short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based
sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results
show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling
domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.

*Tien-Hong Lo,Szu-Yu Chen,Yao-Ting Sung,Berlin Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel automated speaking assessment (ASA) method that combines SSL representations with handcrafted features, addressing limitations in prior approaches by introducing a multi-margin ordinal loss and outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous ASA methods fail to fully capture linguistic and prosodic nuances and often ignore the ordinal nature and uneven intervals of proficiency labels.

Method: The approach integrates SSL models with handcrafted features and introduces a multi-margin ordinal loss to account for both score ordinality and varying proficiency label intervals.

Result: Experiments on the TEEMI corpus demonstrate consistent performance improvements and strong generalization to unseen prompts compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective improvement for automated speaking assessments, leveraging SSL and innovative modeling techniques to better represent proficiency levels and linguistic patterns.

Abstract: A recent line of research on automated speaking assessment (ASA) has
benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, which capture
rich acoustic and linguistic patterns in non-native speech without underlying
assumptions of feature curation. However, speech-based SSL models capture
acoustic-related traits but overlook linguistic content, while text-based SSL
models rely on ASR output and fail to encode prosodic nuances. Moreover, most
prior arts treat proficiency levels as nominal classes, ignoring their ordinal
structure and non-uniform intervals between proficiency labels. To address
these limitations, we propose an effective ASA approach combining SSL with
handcrafted indicator features via a novel modeling paradigm. We further
introduce a multi-margin ordinal loss that jointly models both the score
ordinality and non-uniform intervals of proficiency labels. Extensive
experiments on the TEEMI corpus show that our method consistently outperforms
strong baselines and generalizes well to unseen prompts.

### [253] [A proximal augmented Lagrangian method for nonconvex optimization with equality and inequality constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02894)
*Adeyemi D. Adeoye,Puya Latafat,Alberto Bemporad*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptable inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian method (P-ALM) to improve efficiency and robustness in solving structured nonconvex optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current augmented Lagrangian methods often suffer from inefficiencies, particularly ill-conditioning caused by linearly increasing penalty parameters. A better adaptive mechanism for penalty and proximal parameter tuning is needed for nonconvex problems.

Method: The authors introduced a method that uses an adaptive rule for updating both penalty and proximal parameters to enhance the convergence speed and mitigate ill-conditioning. They also leveraged insights about augmented Lagrangian behavior to provide simpler theoretical justifications for P-ALM.

Result: The proposed P-ALM method exhibited better performance compared to traditional methods in numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex optimization problems.

Conclusion: The introduced P-ALM provides a simpler, theoretically sound, and more adaptable approach for enhanced efficiency and performance in solving structured optimization challenges.

Abstract: We propose an inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian method (P-ALM) for
nonconvex structured optimization problems. The proposed method features an
easily implementable rule not only for updating the penalty parameters, but
also for adaptively tuning the proximal term. It allows the penalty parameter
to grow rapidly in the early stages to speed up progress, while ameliorating
the issue of ill-conditioning in later iterations, a well-known drawback of the
traditional approach of linearly increasing the penalty parameters. A key
element in our analysis lies in the observation that the augmented Lagrangian
can be controlled effectively along the iterates, provided an initial feasible
point is available. Our analysis, while simple, provides a new theoretical
perspective about P-ALM and, as a by-product, results in similar convergence
properties for its non-proximal variant, the classical augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM). Numerical experiments, including convex and nonconvex problem
instances, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: This paper improves the computational efficiency of solving stochastic bilevel optimization problems by introducing a new method called F${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses higher-order smoothness for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to accelerate the process of finding $
$-stationary points in stochastic bilevel optimizations since existing methods like F${}^2$SA are slower than optimal rates for single-level problems.

Method: Propose a higher-order method, F${}^2$SA-$p$, that utilizes $p$th-order finite differences for hyper-gradient approximation, improving convergence rates based on higher-order smooth problem assumptions.

Result: F${}^2$SA-$p$ achieves an upper complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(p \epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$-order smooth problems, closely matching the $
{-4}) minimal theory prediction, nearly.opt.

Conclusion: The proposed Fester---near-F ultra-opt Rate

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
for stochastic bilevel optimization when the upper-level problem is nonconvex
and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent work proposed the
first-order method, F${}^2$SA, achieving the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ upper complexity bound for first-order
smooth problems. This is slower than the optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$
complexity lower bound in its single-level counterpart. In this work, we show
that faster rates are achievable for higher-order smooth problems. We first
reformulate F$^2$SA as approximating the hyper-gradient with a forward
difference. Based on this observation, we propose a class of methods
F${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses $p$th-order finite difference for hyper-gradient
approximation and improves the upper bound to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(p
\epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$th-order smooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate
that the $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound also holds for stochastic bilevel
problems when the high-order smoothness holds for the lower-level variable,
indicating that the upper bound of F${}^2$SA-$p$ is nearly optimal in the
highly smooth region $p = \Omega( \log \epsilon^{-1} / \log \log
\epsilon^{-1})$.

TL;DR: This paper reviews plug-and-play (PnP) methods for solving inverse problems in imaging by integrating data-driven image denoisers into iterative reconstruction algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems in modern imaging science have broad applications but are challenging to solve, motivating the use of data-driven techniques for higher fidelity solutions.

Method: The authors survey PnP methods, which replace traditional regularization by incorporating learned denoisers into proximal splitting algorithms like ADMM and PGD, while examining theoretical and practical aspects for convergence.

Result: The survey offers a comprehensive understanding of PnP methods, including theoretical advances and conditions for algorithmic convergence, as well as practical tips for denoiser design and acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: PnP methods represent a powerful approach for imaging inverse problems, blending theory and practice to leverage advanced image denoisers for regularization and reconstruction.

Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad
applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy.
Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse
problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to
remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for
data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors
in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,
commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a
brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short
review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal
splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned
denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such
replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting
optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the
foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent
diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances
regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal
settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy
for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local
homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,
including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving constrained SOC problems efficiently, which include inequality constraints for states and controls, as well as structural constraints for the controls.

Method: The authors propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based inference method that employs barrier functions for constraints. The approach involves an expectation step for state-control smoothing and a maximization step to infer structured optimal controllers.

Result: The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in scenarios like unicycle obstacle avoidance, multi-robot formation control, and quadcopter navigation under wind disturbances. Parametric studies and comparisons with smoothing algorithms are included.

Conclusion: The proposed EM-based method is effective in generating structured stochastic controllers while satisfying constraints and can be applied to complex robotics problems.

Abstract: Approximate methods to solve stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems have
received significant interest from researchers in the past decade.
Probabilistic inference approaches to SOC have been developed to solve
nonlinear quadratic Gaussian problems. In this work, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based inference procedure to generate
state-feedback controls for constrained SOC problems. We consider the
inequality constraints for the state and controls and also the structural
constraints for the controls. We employ barrier functions to address state and
control constraints. We show that the expectation step leads to smoothing of
the state-control pair while the the maximization step on the non-zero subsets
of the control parameters allows inference of structured stochastic optimal
controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on unicycle
obstacle avoidance, four-unicycle formation control, and quadcopter navigation
in windy environment examples. In these examples, we perform an empirical study
on the parametric effect of barrier functions on the state constraint
satisfaction. We also present a comparative study of smoothing algorithms on
the performance of the proposed approach.

Motivation: MD simulations are highly useful but often restricted by computational costs, limiting their ability to simulate biologically relevant, long-timescale molecular processes.

Method: BioMD employs a hierarchical framework combining forecasting and interpolation to generate long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics based on MD datasets.

Result: BioMD achieves high physical plausibility, low reconstruction errors, and successfully simulates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of protein-ligand systems in specific datasets.

Conclusion: BioMD offers an efficient simulation tool for investigating complex biomolecular processes, with significant implications for computational chemistry and drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools in computational
chemistry and drug discovery, offering crucial insights into dynamic molecular
behavior. However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial
computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many
biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of
existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended
biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and
the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here,
we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate
long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of
forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility
of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both
datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical
plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully
generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within
ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways.
Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex
biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of effectively sampling Fourier frequencies in high-dimensional data problems to enhance random Fourier feature methods.

Method: The study proposes a data-adaptive method that resamples Fourier frequencies optimally and employs numerical approaches like conjugate gradient iterations for validating regression and classification tasks.

Result: Proves theoretical convergence of adaptive resampling for Fourier frequencies and numerically verifies its effectiveness for regression and classification applications.

Conclusion: Adapting Fourier frequency sampling improves random Fourier feature methods, ensuring better computational efficiency and theoretical soundness for high-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract: The machine learning random Fourier feature method for data in high dimension
is computationally and theoretically attractive since the optimization is based
on a convex standard least squares problem and independent sampling of Fourier
frequencies. The challenge is to sample the Fourier frequencies well. This work
proves convergence of a data adaptive method based on resampling the
frequencies asymptotically optimally, as the number of nodes and amount of data
tend to infinity. Numerical results based on resampling and adaptive random
walk steps together with approximations of the least squares problem by
conjugate gradient iterations confirm the analysis for regression and
classification problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient new algorithms for updating bidiagonal factorizations in matrix data streams with low-rank changes, providing alternatives to costly SVD-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing methods for high-throughput matrix updates, like SVD-based methods, are computationally expensive and unsuitable for large truncation ranks.

Method: The proposed methods use compact Householder-type algorithms and Givens rotations to efficiently update bidiagonal factorizations, reducing computational and memory requirements.

Result: The algorithms outperform traditional methods in scalability and efficiency while maintaining accuracy, exemplified in applications like recommendation systems and networks.

Conclusion: These algorithms offer scalable, accurate, and efficient solutions for updating matrix factorization in high-throughput settings without relying on conventional SVD approaches.

Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For
high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal
SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,
incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for
large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms
that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the
SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm
that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the
memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm
based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales
quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The
algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we
demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,
and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI-generated personas based on large language models can simulate human perspectives effectively, aiding in hypothesis generation and validation in computational social science.

Method: Interviews with 15 startup founders were conducted, followed by replication of the same protocol with AI-driven personas. A structured thematic analysis compared human and synthetic-derived themes across four categories.

Result: The study identified four thematic outcomes: overlapping concerns of founders and synthetic personas, partial matches where both datasets diverge, unique human insights, and exclusive AI perspectives like amplified false positives and historical blind spots.

Conclusion: LLM-driven personas offer a hybrid simulation medium with greater linguistic adaptability but lack relational context, making them useful for extending research but not replacing human-centric empirical studies.

Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject
interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to
evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation.
Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and
concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated
with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic
synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -
commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains
were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -
founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real
customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind
spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -
relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism
toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false
positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by
missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas
constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive
and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of
lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical
studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -
capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and
clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABMs are powerful for simulating complex systems but their computational demands and parameter calibration challenges have impeded wider adoption.

Method: The paper applies automatic differentiation to ABMs, integrating it with variational inference techniques for enhanced calibration and sensitivity analysis.

Result: Substantial performance improvements and computational savings are demonstrated on three specific ABMs: Axtell's model of firms, Sugarscape, and the SIR epidemiological model.

Conclusion: Automatic differentiation significantly boosts the practicality and scalability of ABMs, making them more accessible for studying complex systems.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Result: The system achieves a hover distance mean error of 6.9mm and a touch contact accuracy of 98.0%, performing well across various conditions.

Conclusion: Such technology enhances mixed reality experiences by enabling reliable touch detection on uninstrumented surfaces, advancing interaction design in diverse environments.

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

*Nathan DeVrio,Vimal Mollyn,Chris Harrison*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a method for estimating arm pose using a smartphone and smartwatch, leveraging ultra-wideband technology to overcome issues of accuracy and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for arm pose estimation often require cameras or multiple sensors, which compromise privacy or usability. The authors aim to create a more accessible solution for consumers.

Method: The paper proposes using both inertial data and ultra-wideband (UWB) functionalities of off-the-shelf smartphones and smartwatches to estimate arm pose without training data.

Result: The implementation achieves a median positional error of 11.0 cm for wrist and elbow joint estimation.

Conclusion: This approach offers an accurate and accessible method for arm pose estimation by utilizing existing consumer devices, solving challenges like drift and privacy issues.

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

*Sandra C. Matz,C. Blaine Horton,Sofie Goethals*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI language models influence human choices, finding that AI agents reduce uniqueness and diversity in individuals' decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how delegating decisions to AI affects human identity, distinctiveness, and diversity.

Method: Analyzing 110,000 real choices from 1,000 U.S. social media users, comparing human decisions to those assisted by generic and personalized AI agents.

Result: Both AI agents make people's choices trend towards popular options, reducing uniqueness. Personalized agents decrease diversity in individuals' choices more than generic agents.

Conclusion: AI agents, whether generic or personalized, can constrain human agency by flattening individuality and diversity. Designing AI systems should aim to preserve diversity and enhance human agency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on people's behalf: they write
emails, buy groceries, and book restaurants. While the outsourcing of human
decision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a
fundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI
reshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two
identity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a
person's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the
breadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from
social-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we
compare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift
people's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of
their behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers
this homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly
compresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what
they explore across topics and psychological affinities. Understanding how AI
agents might flatten human experience, and how using generic versus
personalized agents involves distinctiveness-diversity trade-offs, is critical
for designing systems that augment rather than constrain human agency, and for
safeguarding diversity in thought, taste, and expression.

*Yaniv Goren,Yuval Cohen,Alexander Apartsin,Yehudit Aperstein*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving human-computer interaction by recognizing interjections (e.g., 'mmm', 'hmm')—a task overlooked in ASR systems. It introduces a new dataset and uses data augmentation techniques to enhance interjection classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interjections are crucial for natural dialogues but are disregarded by ASR systems, creating gaps in the effective understanding of human communication.

Method: The authors developed and published a dataset of interjections and trained a baseline deep learning model. They also enhanced data using augmentation techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation.

Result: Using augmented data improved the classification accuracy significantly, making the models more robust.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel task and provides tools and datasets for future research, advancing interjection recognition in human-computer interaction systems.

Abstract: In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue
between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of
this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite
their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for
information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a
novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to
our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of
interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In
this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected
specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train
and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment
the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation,
which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust.
The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline,
baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research
community.

Abstract: Mitotic figures are classified into typical and atypical variants, with
atypical counts correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness. Accurate
differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource
allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we
leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores a dynamic, patient-specific digital twin framework for optimizing liver cancer radioembolization using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physics-informed machine learning techniques like PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of optimizing radioembolization therapy for liver cancer, given the complexity of hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainties in microsphere transport.

Method: A liver radioembolization framework is presented, leveraging CFD for personalized treatment planning and utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their advanced extensions (e.g., PI-GANs, diffusion models) to accelerate predictions and resolve patient-specific variations.

Result: Combining CFD and physics-informed AI methods provides accurate, efficient, and uncertainty-aware predictions, enabling real-time treatment planning and decision-making for personalized radioembolization therapies.

Conclusion: The integration of CFD and physics-informed AI holds promise for creating dynamic, patient-specific digital twins, optimizing liver radioembolization planning, and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers
radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the
hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while
minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging
due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in
microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins
may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a
framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine
learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport
calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which
enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is
computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability.
  To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their
generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate
governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the
neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient
approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed
generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and
transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally
resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not
only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow
scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support.
  Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic,
patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and
ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduced a new task of classifying normal and atypical mitotic figures in histopathology, using complementary models and approaches to handle class imbalances and cross-domain challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the clinically significant issue of distinguishing normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, which is an imbalanced and cross-domain problem.

Method: The study used ConvNeXt-Small (ImageNet pretrained) and a ViT model (self-supervised domain-specific pretrained) backbones. Synthetic atypical examples were generated to balance class prevalence and train models. Five-fold cross-validation was applied.

Result: Both backbones showed strong performance, achieving about 95% AUROC. ConvNeXt had higher peak performance, while the ViT model demonstrated better stability across folds. Synthetic balancing offered limited improvements. On a hidden test subset, ConvNeXt achieved 95.4% AUROC.

Conclusion: Both ImageNet- and domain-pretrained models are effective for atypical mitosis classification. ImageNet pretraining offers peak performance, while domain-pretraining ensures robustness. Synthetic data balancing had minimal benefits.

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by
introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to
distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a
clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We
investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on
ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via
self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.
1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate
class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic
data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong
performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving
slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.
Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the
organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an
out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4
percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These
findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable
for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring
robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive
synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be
reported upon challenge completion.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes a two-stage framework for mitosis detection in challenging whole-slide images, combining improved YOLO11x and ConvNeXt-Tiny to enhance F1-score performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of detecting mitoses in whole-slide images with heterogeneous and complex contexts, as false positives and false negatives significantly undermine the detection F1-score.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework: (1) utilizing an improved YOLO11x model with EMA attention and LSConv for generating mitosis candidates with high recall, and (2) employing a ConvNeXt-Tiny classifier to filter false positives and improve precision.

Result: The two-stage framework achieves an F1-score of 0.882 on a fused dataset, improving by 0.035 over the YOLO11x baseline. The precision improved from 0.762 to 0.839, with comparable recall.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances mitosis detection performance by significantly increasing precision while maintaining recall, demonstrating its efficacy in challenging WSI scenarios.

Abstract: MIDOG 2025 Track 1 requires mitosis detection in whole-slide images (WSIs)
containing non-tumor, inflamed, and necrotic regions. Due to the complicated
and heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false
positives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To
address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved
YOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate
mitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many
proposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny
classifier is employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the
detection precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can
generate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising
MIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score
of 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline. This
performance gain is produced by a significant precision improvement, from 0.762
to 0.839, and a comparable recall. The code is available at

Method: Three approaches were explored: adapting the UNI2-h foundation model using LoRA-based methods, visual prompt tuning (VPT), and employing test-time augmentation (TTA) combined with stain normalization techniques like Vahadane and Macenko.

Result: The proposed methods achieved high balanced accuracy (0.8837) and strong ROC-AUC (0.9513), ranking among the top teams in the MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge.

Conclusion: Prompt-based adaptation methods coupled with stain-normalization enhancements significantly improve classification performance of atypical mitoses, offering robustness to diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of
abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to
morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated
three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the
MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge. Starting from a LoRA-based baseline, we found that
visual prompt tuning (VPT) substantially improved generalization, and that
further integrating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko
stain normalization provided the best robustness. Our final submission achieved
a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary
leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results demonstrate that
prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers an
effective strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging
conditions.

Motivation: The need for accurate classification of mitotic figures to improve cancer grading and prognosis, especially under challenges like domain shifts and class imbalance.

Method: A lightweight ConvNeXt model trained on diverse datasets with histopathology-specific augmentations and balanced sampling, evaluated using grouped 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961 in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, ranking among the top solutions.

Conclusion: Broad domain exposure alongside tailored augmentation strategies proves effective in creating accurate and generalizable classifiers for pathology applications.

Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology,
as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis.
Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor
aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to
subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is
further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue
type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance.
To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose
a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all
available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize
domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific
augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations,
and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold
cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary
leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among
the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined
with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and
generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.

Method: A two-stage pipeline with Faster R-CNN for detection and three classifiers for reducing false positives.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.2237, with high recall (0.9528) but very low precision (12.67%).

Conclusion: The work underscores challenges in developing robust detection systems and highlights the need for better false positive suppression strategies.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational
pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper
describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust
mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a
two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an
ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2,
InceptionResNet-v2) for false positive reduction. Our best submission achieved
F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN
trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective
mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals
fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically
similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants
showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive,
highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This

Abstract: Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images
remains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity,
and the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols.
The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating
detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of
generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the
performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on

stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In
internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided
improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation in X-ray angiography is inefficient, and existing automated methods lack generalizability and effective hierarchical knowledge utilization.

Method: Deep Self-knowledge Distillation incorporates hierarchical outputs, probabilistic distribution vectors, and pixel-wise supervision for enhancing segmentation model performance.

Result: Experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets show significant improvements in dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity, and IoU over other comparative models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances the generalization, robustness, and efficiency of coronary artery segmentation models, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to overcome limitations in segmenting small abdominal organs caused by severe class imbalance, poor spatial context, and the lack of annotated data in CT imaging.

Method: The proposed method integrates variational reconstruction, supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback using a VAE-UNet backbone. It employs patch-based training with synthetic patches and enhances fidelity with perceptual reconstruction loss (using VGG features) and a PatchGAN-style discriminator.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset show that the approach improves segmentation accuracy, specifically in boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the potential of hybrid generative-discriminative training regimes for segmenting small organs, providing insights into balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency under data-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the
adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe
class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this
work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction,
supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these
limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon
a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates
voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled
representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a
patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches
generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects
of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance
output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss
using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial
supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset
demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in
boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative
training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into
balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce
scenarios.

TL;DR: The study compares domain-specific RETFound models with generalist DINOv2/DINOv3 models for retinal image applications, finding RETFound models more effective for clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether domain-specific medical foundation models are still necessary given advancements in generalist foundation models.

Method: Assessed RETFound models against DINOv2/DINOv3 in retinal image-based disease detection using fine-tuning, linear probing, data efficiency, and adaptation efficiency analyses.

Result: RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperformed generalist models in detection and prediction tasks, showcasing better generalisability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: Specialist models remain superior for clinical use, but scaling generalist models shows promise for future foundation models in healthcare.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data,
demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications.
RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this
approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of
increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as
DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training
remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image
applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and
RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and
systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and
linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed
to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational
cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong
adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms
these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics
tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These
findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most
effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with
generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can
deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for
future medical foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimized algorithms in HPE Chapel for enhancing community detection in graphs, supporting analysis of datasets with billions of edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address scalability issues in community detection when applying Well-Connected Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms to massive graphs.

Method: The study leverages parallel algorithms using HPE Chapel and integrates these into Arkouda/Arachne for handling large-scale graph analytics efficiently.

Result: The optimized implementations enable community detection on colossal datasets, like Open-Alex with over 2 billion edges, in just minutes using multicore systems with 128 cores.

Conclusion: By heavily optimizing WCC and CM techniques, this work makes well-connected community detection feasible for web-scale networks.

Abstract: Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures
in networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly
connected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected
Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing
techniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they
are computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present
optimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel
programming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms
that leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance
improvements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we
integrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance
framework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable
well-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion
edges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at
web scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community
detection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128
cores, a result infeasible to compute previously.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReCC, an unsupervised framework using contrastive learning and regular equivalence-based clustering to identify influential nodes in networks without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve influential node identification in complex networks while overcoming the limitations of supervised methods dependent on scarce or unavailable labeled data and existing contrastive learning approaches reliant on multiple-embedding generation.

Method: The method involves reformulating the problem as a label-free deep clustering task, leveraging regular equivalence-based similarities to design contrastive learning mechanisms for structural similarity, and embedding these into a graph convolutional network. It includes pre-training via reconstruction loss and fine-tuning with contrastive and clustering losses, eliminating the need for labeled data.

Result: ReCC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques across multiple benchmarks, validating its efficacy using extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ReCC successfully identifies influential nodes in a label-free manner by integrating contrastive learning, clustering, and structural similarity measures, marking a significant advancement in unsupervised methods for network analysis.

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in
network analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep
learning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches
remain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable.
While contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance
enhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding
generation to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ReCC (\textit{r}egular \textit{e}quivalence-based
\textit{c}ontrastive \textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework
for influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node
identification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a
contrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based
similarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local
neighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is
integrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are
used to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is
pre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined
contrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled
data. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural
metrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and effectiveness of GNNs in analyzing time-series data from mobile networks for social network analysis.

Method: The study evaluates four temporal GNN models and a simple non-GNN baseline model using the EdgeBank method for predicting phone call and SMS activity.

Result: ROLAND, one of the GNN models, outperforms the baseline method, while other GNNs show mixed results, often underperforming.

Conclusion: While ROLAND shows promise, the study highlights the need for specialized GNN architectures for more effective temporal social network analysis.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven
tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and
integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as
of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's
mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present
study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the
phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In
addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed
EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms
the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on
average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches
hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile
connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin
between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on
specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a secure password generation method using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator based on MAC algorithms, producing highly randomized and secure passwords.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address rising concerns over password security due to breaches, highlighting the importance of secure password generation for protecting personal information and system security.

Method: The study employed a secure password generation approach utilizing cryptographically secure PRNGs with MAC algorithms (HMAC, CMAC, KMAC). Evaluation followed NIST SP 800-90B focusing on entropy estimation and IID property verification.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed the proposed approach met both entropy and IID requirements, proving its ability to generate secure and highly random passwords.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances password security by ensuring high randomness and adherence to established standards, addressing concerns around personal data protection.

Abstract: In recent years, numerous incidents involving the leakage of website accounts
and text passwords (referred to as passwords) have raised significant concerns
regarding the potential exposure of personal information. These events
underscore the critical importance of both information security and password
protection. While many of these breaches are attributable to vulnerabilities
within website infrastructure, the strength and security of the passwords
themselves also play a crucial role. Consequently, the creation of secure
passwords constitutes a fundamental aspect of enhancing overall system security
and protecting personal data. In response to these challenges, this study
presents a secure password generation approach utilizing a cryptographically
secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). The generator is implemented
using a range of Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms, including the
Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), Cipher-based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC), and KECCAK Message Authentication Code (KMAC), to
produce robust random values suitable for password generation. To evaluate the
proposed method, empirical assessments were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines provided in the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-90B. The evaluation focused on two primary
aspects: entropy estimation and verification of independent and identically
distributed (IID) properties. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method satisfies both entropy and IID requirements, thereby demonstrating its
ability to generate passwords with a high degree of randomness and security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TraceLLM is introduced to integrate Ethereum smart contract trace-level detection with decompiled contract code, improving security analysis by enhancing precision in identifying attacks and generating automated reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the existing challenges in Ethereum smart contract security analysis, which include limited insight into specific attack strategies, inability to analyze unverified contracts, and reliance on manual inspection for forensic reconstruction.

Method: TraceLLM leverages LLMs, an anomaly execution path identification algorithm, and an LLM-refined decompiler to analyze execution traces and decompiled contract code simultaneously. Explicit attack paths are provided for improved analysis.

Result: TraceLLM achieves 85.19% precision in identifying attacker and victim addresses, 70.37% factual precision in automated reports across 27 cases, and improves accuracy by 25.93% compared to baselines. For 148 real-world cases, it achieves 66.22% expert-verified report accuracy.

Conclusion: TraceLLM significantly enhances generalizability and precision in Ethereum smart contract security analysis, establishing a benchmark for joint trace and code-driven investigations while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet
comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code,
proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex
execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly
transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited
insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside
transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified
contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real
incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces
with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To
address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to
integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We
introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an
LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide
explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for
joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy
baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three
representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies
attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated
reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert
reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover,
across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates
reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong

*Moontaha Nishat Chowdhury,André Bauer,Minxuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve recommendation systems using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) while reducing computational and communication costs by handling matrix sparsity with a novel compressed representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy concerns of using sensitive data in recommendation systems, and tackle the inefficiency of applying computationally intensive FHE to large and sparse user-item rating matrices.

Method: The authors combine Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization to efficiently manage matrix sparsity and minimize communication overhead in an encrypted domain.

Result: Experimental results show their approach achieves high recommendation accuracy with encrypted data while ensuring the lowest communication costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively preserves user privacy and enhances the practicality of FHE in handling large, sparse data for recommendation systems.

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user
experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a
significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently
handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE
operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse
matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical
concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed
Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that
efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing
communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation
accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,
effectively preserving user privacy.

### [295] [Managing Correlations in Data and Privacy Demand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02856)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper critiques the existing HDP framework for privacy-utility tradeoff when privacy demands are correlated with user data and proposes the AHDP framework to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in the standard HDP framework that fails when user data and privacy demands are correlated.

Method: Develops a new framework called Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), formalizing it through a hypothesis testing perspective and proposing mechanisms tailored to common statistical tasks.

Result: Demonstrated that AHDP mechanisms function effectively even without prior knowledge of data-privacy correlations and showed empirical results on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: AHDP offers a robust and practical alternative to HDP, accommodating data-privacy correlations and being suitable for real-world applications in statistical tasks.

Abstract: Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to
choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous
differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user
data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the
standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are
allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an
alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that
jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is
robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize
the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis
testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent
interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that
there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior
knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and
apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency
estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to
implement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them
attractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP
mechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic
datasets, which we release for future research.

### [296] [Enhanced Single-Cell RNA-seq Embedding through Gene Expression and Data-Driven Gene-Gene Interaction Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02639)
*Hojjat Torabi Goudarzi,Maziyar Baran Pouyan*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced embedding method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that integrates gene expression profiles and gene-gene interactions using graph-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scRNA-seq embedding methods mostly focus on gene expression and fail to account for gene-gene regulatory relationships, limiting their ability to capture cellular identity and function.

Method: The method constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) with random forests for gene interactions and a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) for cell expressions, combining them into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG) processed by a graph neural network for cell embeddings.

Result: The proposed method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves single-cell analysis tasks like visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating expression data and gene-gene interactions provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states, advancing the understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in scRNA-seq analysis.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into
cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological
systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and
technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical
challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression
levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular
identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding
approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven
gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG)
using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes,
while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent
expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an
Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural
network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and
gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive
representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple
datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell
populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering,
and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant
advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for
understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The study introduces a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) method for survival prediction using high-dimensional multi-omics data to improve biomarker discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing survival prediction and biomarker discovery by addressing the challenges of feature selection in high-dimensional multi-omics data.

Method: The hEFS method combines data subsampling, multiple prognostic models, and voting-based ranking, selecting features via a Pareto front to balance accuracy and sparsity.

Result: When tested on pancreatic cancer datasets, hEFS identified fewer, more stable biomarkers compared to traditional models while maintaining comparable prediction performance.

Conclusion: hEFS is a robust and interpretable tool for survival prediction and biomarker discovery, implemented in the mlr3fselect R package for clinical applications.

Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data
requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive
performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We
developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines
data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and
wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked
using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and
subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto
front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any
user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three
pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable
biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while
maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the
open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and
clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in
high-dimensional survival settings.

*Derek Jones,Yue Yang,Felice C. Lightstone,Niema Moshiri,Jonathan E. Allen,Tajana S. Rosing*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurGBSA, a machine-learning surrogate for MMGBSA, showing remarkable speed and accuracy while leveraging molecular dynamics simulation data for improved predictive molecular representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised pretraining on static molecular structures provides strong feature representations, but these approaches fail to leverage dynamic data from molecular simulations, limiting their ability to improve prediction accuracy for new molecular structures.

Method: The authors developed SurGBSA, a physics-informed pretraining model that uses molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) simulations as a surrogate. They trained the model on over 1.4 million 3D molecular dynamics trajectories extracted from the CASF-2016 benchmark.

Result: SurGBSA achieves a 6,497x speedup compared to traditional MMGBSA calculations and maintains nearly equivalent accuracy, with only a -0.4% difference in the pose ranking task for identifying correct ligand poses.

Conclusion: SurGBSA shows that physics-informed pretraining on dynamical molecular data significantly improves molecular representation models, enabling rapid and accurate predictive modeling. The authors provide models, code, and data for further use and development.

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and
proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features
demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks
including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand
interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static
structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve
prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA
(SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning,
which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born
Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of
physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection
of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the
CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a
traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching
single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for
identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances
the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements
when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made
publicly available.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2M2ECG, a lightweight and efficient state-space model (SSM) for multi-lead ECG signal processing, achieving a balance between performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in effectively fusing information from multi-lead ECG signals for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, balancing performance, computational efficiency, and feature integration.

Method: Proposes S2M2ECG, a novel SSM-based architecture with three fusion levels: spatio-temporal signal fusion via bi-directional SSMs, intra-lead temporal fusion, and cross-lead feature interaction. It also integrates multi-branch designs and lead fusion modules for tailored lead analysis and integration.

Result: S2M2ECG demonstrates superior performance across various scenarios (rhythmic, morphological, clinical) and achieves efficient inference with one of the smallest parameter sizes among existing models.

Conclusion: S2M2ECG strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and clinical applicability, making it a promising tool for lightweight, high-performance CVD diagnosis.

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative EEG-based framework (EEG-MSAF) to improve dementia diagnosis through microstate analysis, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing global issue of dementia by enhancing early and accurate diagnosis using EEG, overcoming limitations of conventional EEG methods.

Method: Developed a three-stage framework (EEG-MSAF) incorporating automated microstate feature extraction, machine learning-based classification, and explainability analysis using SHAP.

Result: EEG-MSAF demonstrated strong diagnostic performance, achieving 89% accuracy on the CAUEEG dataset and 95% on the Thessaloniki dataset. Key biomarkers such as microstate C and F were identified to predict dementia and mild cognitive impairment.

Conclusion: EEG-MSAF improves diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability in dementia studies, providing novel insights into brain dynamics for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to leverage quantum computing's efficiency for brain tumor classification using MRI images, addressing computational challenges and medical imaging needs.

Method: The study involves a QCNN model with quantum convolution, flatten, and dense layers (filter size: 2, depth: 4, 4 qubits), trained on MRI data (3,264 images, 10 epochs). Data balancing via oversampling was applied to address class imbalances.

Result: The binary QCNN model achieved 89% accuracy after data balancing, while the multiclass QCNN model reached 62% after oversampling.

Conclusion: QCNNs show promise in binary classification for medical imaging, but improvements in quantum architectures and hybrid methods are needed for effective multiclass classification and clinical use.

Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks
(QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum
computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images,
including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was
utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an
oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model
consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with
a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two
models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor
presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The
binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,
while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after
oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass
model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit
limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging
applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further
refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid
classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass
classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and robustness of breast lesion detection in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), especially in high-risk and heterogeneous clinical datasets.

Method: The pipeline uses DINOv2-based self-supervised learning to pretrain the MST for per-slice feature embedding generation, which is then processed by a KAN classifier with adaptive B-spline activations for increased interpretability and performance in classifying lesions.

Result: The MST+KAN pipeline achieves an AUC of 0.80 ± 0.02, outperforming the baseline MST classifier while maintaining interpretability via attention-based heatmaps.

Conclusion: The combination of foundation model embeddings (MST) and advanced classification strategies (KAN) provides an effective and interpretable method for robust breast MRI lesion analysis.

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.

*Xiangpeng Li,Junwei Ma,Bo Li,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to measure societal impacts of power outages, focusing on their effect on different demographics and recovery timelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a standardized methodology to assess societal impacts of power outages and address equity issues in disaster recovery, particularly in hurricanes.

Method: Quantified outage exposure using deprivation measures alongside welfare metrics, analyzing with recovery indicators like outage days per customer, restoration duration, and restoration rate; utilized EAGLE I data and demographic linkages.

Result: Findings showed more severe impacts in lower-income areas and identified restoration duration as the dominant factor affecting societal deprivation.

Conclusion: The study offers a transferable tool for equitable outage impact analysis, emphasizes equity in restoration planning, and provides actionable spatial insights for resilience investments.

Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas
contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily
affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study
introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by
translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures,
integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days
per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed
from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area
demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas,
Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this
standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of
outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with
greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation
increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster
restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the
dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not
captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a
transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross
event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable
spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and
resilience investment.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This study introduces a graph neural network (dualGNN) for multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts, demonstrating superior performance across datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble forecasting systems often suffer from biases, requiring statistical post-processing to ensure accurate probabilistic predictions, especially when capturing dependencies across forecast dimensions.

Method: The study employs a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained on a composite loss function combining energy score (ES) and variogram score (VS), evaluated on solar irradiance and visibility datasets.

Result: dualGNN outperforms traditional methods in multivariate verification, effectively restoring spatial dependencies for WRF forecasts and showing superior calibration for ECMWF visibility forecasts.

Conclusion: This approach enhances dependency restoration and predictive accuracy in ensemble forecasting, advancing over existing post-processing methods.

Abstract: Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing
probabilistic estimates of future states, supporting applications from
renewable energy production to transportation safety. Nonetheless, systematic
biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional
parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can
produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead
times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions.
To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula
coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore
realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study
is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural
network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the
energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two
datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF
visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms
all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant
improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the
continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) or the ES, according to the
evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF
forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable
dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial
relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or
historical observational rank structures. By contrast, for the visibility
forecasts, the GNNs trained on CRPS, ES, or the ES-VS combination outperform
the calibrated reference.

TL;DR: The paper develops zero-inflated Poisson frameworks to improve telematics-based risk prediction for UBI applications, focusing on sparse and heterogeneous driving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Usage-based insurance leveraging telematics is hindered by sparse, zero-inflated data and heterogeneous driving behavior, requiring better modeling approaches.

Method: The study introduces zero-inflated Poisson frameworks with latent behavior groups, fitted using EM and offset-based count models to address data sparsity and heterogeneity.

Result: Using a dataset of 354 commercial drivers over 287,511 trips, the models showed improvements over baselines, demonstrated better calibration out-of-sample, and provided robust sensitivity analyses on clustering.

Conclusion: The proposed models enable interpretable risk predictions, supporting context-aware insurance ratemaking and fairer premiums based on heterogeneous driving styles.

Abstract: Driving behavior big data leverages multi-sensor telematics to understand how
people drive and powers applications such as risk evaluation, insurance
pricing, and targeted intervention. Usage-based insurance (UBI) built on these
data has become mainstream. Telematics-captured near-miss events (NMEs) provide
a timely alternative to claim-based risk, but weekly NMEs are sparse, highly
zero-inflated, and behaviorally heterogeneous even after exposure
normalization. Analyzing multi-sensor telematics and ADAS warnings, we show
that the traditional statistical models underfit the dataset. We address these
challenges by proposing a set of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) frameworks that
learn latent behavior groups and fit offset-based count models via EM to yield
calibrated, interpretable weekly risk predictions. Using a naturalistic dataset
from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, during which the drivers
completed 287,511 trips and logged 8,142,896 km in total, our results show
consistent improvements over baselines and prior telematics models, with lower
AIC/BIC values in-sample and better calibration out-of-sample. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses on the EM-based grouping for the number of
clusters, finding that the gains were robust and interpretable. Practically,
this supports context-aware ratemaking on a weekly basis and fairer premiums by
recognizing heterogeneous driving styles.

*Mariia Drozdova,Erica Lastufka,Vitaliy Kinakh,Taras Holotyak,Daniel Schaerer,Slava Voloshynovskiy*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper investigates how general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which lack exposure to specific scientific data, perform in classifying radio galaxies using the MiraBest dataset. The study finds that VLMs show potential but are highly sensitive to prompt variations. Fine-tuning a VLM achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if generic VLMs, despite lacking specialized training in astronomy, can classify radio galaxies and assess their utility in scientific imaging tasks.

Method: The authors tested VLMs using natural language prompts, schematic diagrams, and visual in-context examples. They also applied LoRA fine-tuning to adapt the models in a lightweight, supervised manner.

Result: The study identified three trends: (i) VLMs perform well with prompts, evidencing useful priors for unfamiliar domains; (ii) VLM outputs are unstable to minor prompt variations; and (iii) a fine-tuned VLM model achieved near SOTA performance, rivaling specialized astronomy models.

Conclusion: Generic VLMs can serve as effective but fragile tools for scientific applications. Their apparent reasoning capability is influenced more by prompt design than true inference, warranting caution while leveraging them in scientific research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are
positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains.
Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and
potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In
this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to
astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio
galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies
using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within
prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised
adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even
prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs
encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs
are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such
as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is
held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no
astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near
state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models.
These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects
prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use
in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs
can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for
scientific discovery.

*Nefeli Manoudaki,Mert Toka,Iason Paterakis,Diarmid Flatley*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Simulacra Naturae is a media installation that translates brain organoid activity into a sensory ecosystem of visuals, audio, living plants, and fabricated artifacts, aiming to decentralize human agency and explore ecological care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how biological computation, material ecologies, and generative systems can foster collective care and reimagine visualization beyond human-centric approaches.

Method: The work uses pre-recorded neural activity from lab-grown brain organoids, which drive a generative system consisting of visuals, audio, plants, and clay artifacts, treating the organoid activity as a co-creative force rather than direct input.

Result: The installation creates a multi-sensory environment merging computational fabrication, neural rhythms, and natural elements, offering participants an immersive, nonhuman cognition-driven experience.

Conclusion: By blending data with living materials and embodied experiences, the installation advocates for decentralizing human agency, fostering empathy, and reshaping ethical engagement within hybrid computational and ecological systems.

Abstract: Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores
collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material
ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural
activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons,
into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio,
living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed
through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by
natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using
biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity
as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and
atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally
fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound
resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment,
filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring
real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field
shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials
and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a
practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for
ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.

### [309] [HF-RAG: Hierarchical Fusion-based RAG with Multiple Sources and Rankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02837)
*Payel Santra,Madhusudan Ghosh,Debasis Ganguly,Partha Basuchowdhuri,Sudip Kumar Naskar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for combining labeled and unlabeled data sources in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a two-step aggregation and score standardization approach, yielding improved results in fact verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of harnessing complementary information from both labeled and unlabeled data in RAG models while overcoming incomparability between their similarity scores.

Method: The method involves first aggregating top documents from multiple IR models for labeled and unlabeled data sources using rank fusion techniques, then standardizing the scores via z-score transformation before merging the documents for better retrieval outcomes.

Result: Evaluations on a fact verification task show improved performance compared to individual rankers or sources, and the approach demonstrates enhanced out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and effective solution to combine heterogeneous sources in RAG, boosting both performance and generalization in specific tasks like fact verification.

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Cross-Pollination (XP) framework to improve e-commerce recommendations by connecting grocery and general merchandise categories using product associations and real-time cart context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping and improve cross-category recommendations.

Method: Developed a two-stage framework: (1) Candidate generation via co-purchase analysis and LLM models, (2) Transformer-based ranker using real-time cart context.

Result: Achieved 36% increase in add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval and 27% NDCG@4 lift with the cart context ranker.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical solutions for cross-category recommendations and insights that enhance customer experience in e-commerce.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

*Renzhi Wu,Junjie Yang,Li Chen,Hong Li,Li Yu,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RankGraph introduces a scalable graph learning framework to address challenges in cross-domain recommendation by leveraging heterogeneous graphs and pre-trained representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain recommendation systems struggle with integrating complex relationships among diverse entities, necessitating an approach to better utilize these finer-grained interactions.

Method: The paper proposes RankGraph, which employs GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Networks with contrastive learning, allowing dynamic extraction of subgraphs and integration of graph representations into FM sequence models.

Result: RankGraph achieved improvements in online A/B tests, showing a 0.92% increase in click rates and a 2.82% increase in conversion rates.

Conclusion: RankGraph proves effective for cross-domain recommendation scenarios by enhancing recommendation models with enriched structured relational knowledge.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes
and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of
complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

### [312] [RecBase: Generative Foundation Model Pretraining for Zero-Shot Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03131)
*Sashuai Zhou,Weinan Gan,Qijiong Liu,Ke Lei,Jieming Zhu,Hai Huang,Yan Xia,Ruiming Tang,Zhenhua Dong,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RecBase, a domain-agnostic foundational model designed to overcome the limitations of traditional LLM-based recommendation systems in cross-domain scenarios through recommendation-specific pretraining and hierarchical item tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommendation systems struggle with cross-domain generalization due to their reliance on language-level knowledge, which fails to capture dynamic, item-level user interests accurately.

Method: RecBase is trained on a large-scale heterogeneous corpus, using a unified textual representation, feature mapping, and hierarchical item tokenization. Its autoregressive training objective allows it to capture complex sequential item preferences.

Result: On eight real-world datasets, RecBase achieves performance comparable or superior to LLM baselines with up to seven times larger parameter sizes, excelling in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: RecBase effectively bridges the gap between language-centric pretraining and recommendation tasks, demonstrating scalability and cross-domain adaptability while outperforming larger LLM models in relevant metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

*Xiaoxiao Xu,Hao Wu,Wenhui Yu,Lantao Hu,Peng Jiang,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes CCSS, a Contrastive learning framework with Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing, which models monotonicity between neural network outputs and numerical features, essential for recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and effectiveness in recommender systems by addressing the critical monotonicity relation between numerical features and neural network outputs.

Method: CCSS employs a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and contrasting them, integrated into an end-to-end, model-agnostic training framework.

Result: Empirical tests on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCSS, which is successfully deployed in large-scale industrial recommender systems serving hundreds of millions of users.

Conclusion: CCSS improves interpretability and effectiveness in recommender systems and proves its scalability and utility in real-world industry applications.

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of
millions users.

TL;DR: The paper presents an ontology and methodology for annotating and organizing Euclidean Geometry problems, explored for its renewed significance in AI-driven education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit a decades-old framework for organizing Euclidean Geometry problems and assess its value when integrated with modern AI tools, particularly large language models, for educational purposes.

Method: The methodology involves documenting the original software tool and ontology developed in the 1990s, and examining its potential integration with current AI for automated solution validation and feedback.

Result: The study finds the framework's original architecture holds potential for supporting geometry education when combined with advanced AI techniques.

Conclusion: The established methodology has enduring value and can serve as a bridge between historical educational tools and contemporary AI advancements in education.

Abstract: This article describes an ontology and methodology for annotating and
organizing Euclidean Geometry problems, developed in the early 1990s and
implemented as a software tool. While the majority of this work -- including
the ontology and solution graph paradigm -- was completed over thirty years
ago, we argue that it has renewed relevance in the context of modern artificial
intelligence. In particular, we explore the hypothesis that this established
framework can facilitate automated solution validation and feedback when paired
with contemporary large language models, thereby supporting teachers and
self-learners in geometry education. We document the original architecture and
its enduring value, and outline pathways for bridging historical educational
resources with next-generation AI techniques.
