The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages.

The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage.

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long tasks, examining why they fail simple tasks when task length increases and highlighting both the benefits and limitations of scaling model size.", "motivation": "Understanding whether and how the performance of LLMs diminishes with task length is critical, as real-world utility often depends on handling long-horizon tasks.", "method": "The paper isolates execution capabilities by providing models with explicit knowledge and plans, explores per-step accuracy degradation, and assesses self-conditioning effects.

This work makes the following contributions:\n(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in\ndecentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these\nstrategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with\napplying alignment across different contexts of use.
