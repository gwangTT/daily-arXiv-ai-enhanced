A parallel and distributed\n(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time\ncomputation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.\nWe will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes\n(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and\nwireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and\nmassively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for\nsolution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of\nartificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully\ndistributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.\nThis is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural\nnetwork algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in\nsilicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks\ncould not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of\nsolutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable\nand practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose\ncomputing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be\ndeveloped for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and\nhighly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing\nas we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,\nengineering or technical problems in real time.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes using wireless sensor networks as a hardware platform for distributed artificial neural networks to tackle real-time, large-scale problems.", "motivation": "Neural networks currently face limitations in real-time computation of large-scale problems due to hardware constraints in traditional silicon and optics-based computing.", "method": "The approach uses wireless sensor networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes for parallel, distributed computation of neural network algorithms.", "result": "Real-time computation of large-scale problems becomes achievable using massively distributed hardware for neural network implementations.", "conclusion": "The method can advance neural computing by solving large-scale, complex problems in real time, potentially revolutionizing the field."}}

In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

This paper applies design science\nresearch to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of\nthree cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,\nincluding collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering\n2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions\ninvolving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to\nsystematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and\nsoftware products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of\nGenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related\nresearch challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated\ninto a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a\nrigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author\nteams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation\nfor analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for\nframing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these\nfindings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper creates a roadmap for adopting Generative AI in software engineering using a rigorous multi-cycle process and predicts 10 trends in SE by 2030.", "motivation": "To explore how Generative AI is transforming software engineering practices and to provide insights for future research and development in this field.", "method": "A design science research approach was employed, involving three iterative cycles with inputs from workshops, literature reviews, and peer feedback.

Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural\nnetworks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator\nhave been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To\naddress this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network\ntraining that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical\nBayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior\nmean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its\ninverse reconstruction map.
