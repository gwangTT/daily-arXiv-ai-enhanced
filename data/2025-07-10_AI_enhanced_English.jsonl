Common techniques for semantic reasoning are often tied to the specific\nstructures of the languages and compilers that they support. In Pyrosome,\nverified compilers are fully extensible, meaning that to extend a language\n(even with a new kind of effect) simply requires defining and verifying the\ncompilation of the new feature, reusing the old correctness theorem for all\nother cases. The novel enabling idea is an inductive formulation of equivalence\npreservation that supports the addition of new rules to the source language,\ntarget language, and compiler.\n  Pyrosome defines a formal, deeply embedded notion of programming languages\nwith semantics given by dependently sorted equational theories, so all\ncompiler-correctness proofs boil down to type-checking and equational\nreasoning. We support vertical composition of any compilers expressed in our\nframework in addition to feature extension. As a case study, we present a\nmultipass compiler from System F with simple references, through CPS\ntranslation and closure conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate how we can\nbuild such a compiler incrementally by starting with a compiler for simply\ntyped lambda-calculus and adding natural numbers, the unit type, recursive\nfunctions, and a global heap, then extending judgments with a type environment\nand adding type abstraction, all while reusing the original theorems.

While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for\nacademic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic.

While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield,\nthe first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse.\nOur platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight\nsubspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation.

Real data\ncollection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the\nunique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network\nenvironment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as\nsimulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate\nsite-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there\nis a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality\n(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews\nrecent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital\ntwins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real\ngap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between\ndigital twin-generated and real data.
