This paper\nintroduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and\neffectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs\nLLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key\nmodules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs\nwith tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and\ndecompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware\nKnowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus\n(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking\nand Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before\na final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a\nchain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG\ncapabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those\nhighlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex\nand noisy queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-RAG is a framework developed to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in handling complex, noisy, and multi-intent queries using advanced LLM-based query preprocessing and retrieval techniques.", "motivation": "To address the challenges RAG systems face with noisy, ambiguous, and complex user queries in real-world scenarios, where traditional models trained on cleaner data perform poorly.", "method": "Omni-RAG uses three modules: (1) query understanding and decomposition to clean and structure input; (2) intent-aware retrieval to fetch relevant information per sub-query; and (3) reranking and generation for refining and producing high-quality outputs.", "result": "The Omni-RAG framework improves the performance of RAG systems in handling difficult, real-world queries, making them more robust and effective compared to conventional systems.", "conclusion": "Omni-RAG provides a significant step forward for live RAG systems by addressing real-world challenges, serving as a benchmark solution to meet growing demands in open-domain applications."}}

Yet, the identification and\ncharacterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.\nIn this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network\npredicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image\nand annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector\ncollection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly\nlearned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,\nHyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density\nareas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment\norgans in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two\n3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the\nAMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real\nunknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a\nstructured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant\nsystematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet\nparameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying\nlearned systematic bias.
