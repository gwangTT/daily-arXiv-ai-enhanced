### [1] [Efficient Agents: Building Effective Agents While Reducing Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02694)
*Ningning Wang,Xavier Hu,Pai Liu,He Zhu,Yue Hou,Heyuan Huang,Shengyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Jiaheng Liu,Ge Zhang,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs in agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to create cost-effective yet high-performing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address escalating costs of LLM-driven systems and make them more scalable and accessible without sacrificing performance.

Method: Empirical analysis using the GAIA benchmark to evaluate LLM backbone selection, agent frameworks, and test-time scaling strategies. Develops a framework called Efficient Agents.

Result: Efficient Agents retain 96.7% of the performance of OWL while reducing costs by 28.4%, from $0.398 to $0.228 per cost-of-pass.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for designing efficient agent systems that balance cost and performance, improving accessibility and sustainability of AI solutions.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

### [2] [Planning with Dynamically Changing Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02697)
*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses planning problems in scenarios where objects may dynamically change, introducing a formulation and approach without relying on the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world planning problems often involve dynamic changes in the set of objects, which is not captured by assuming a fixed set of objects as per the Domain Closure Assumption.

Method: The authors formulate the problem in first-order logic, propose bounded search strategies grounded in planning time, and demonstrate soundness and completeness of their approach.

Result: Their method enables solving bounded planning problems without DCA, applicable to generalized planning and conformant planning under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows promise for handling dynamic object changes in planning problems and provides theoretical and experimental validation through a proof-of-concept implementation.

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

### [3] [Recovering Individual-Level Activity Sequences from Location-Based Service Data Using a Novel Transformer-Based Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02734)
*Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VSNIT, a novel approach to recover incomplete activity sequences in LBS data, by effectively inserting diverse and accurate patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of sparsity in LBS data, which creates challenges in accurately inferring individual-level activity sequences.

Method: This study utilizes the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion Transformer (VSNIT), a hybrid model that integrates dynamic covariate handling and sequence construction capabilities.

Result: VSNIT exhibits superior performance in recovering activity sequences by inserting realistic and diverse activity patterns, surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: VSNIT enhances the utility of LBS data for mobility analysis and offers a robust framework for location-based research and applications.

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys LLM-based agents applied in data science, breaking down design principles and practical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance understanding and applicability of LLM-based agents in performing diverse data science tasks.

Method: The study reviews recent LLM developments and organizes findings into a dual-perspective framework combining agent design principles and data science workflows.

Result: Identified agent design principles (roles, execution, knowledge, reflection) and key data science processes (preprocessing, model development, evaluation, etc.).

principles, covering agent roles, execution, knowledge, and reflection methods.
From the data science perspective, we identify key processes for LLM-based
agents, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation,
visualization, etc. Our work offers two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive
review of recent developments in applying LLMbased agents to data science
tasks; (2) a dual-perspective framework that connects general agent design
principles with the practical workflows in data science.

### [5] [Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789)
*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIO, a method enabling large language models to provide transparent and steerable reasoning, improving accuracy in scientific discovery tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for AI systems that are accurate, transparent, and steerable in reasoning to maximize their utility for scientists.

Method: The paper proposes CLIO, a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization, allowing LLMs to self-adjust problem-solving processes and provide scientists with insights into confidence levels, reasoning structures, and answers.

Result: OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO achieved 22.37% accuracy on Humanity's Last Exam, significantly outperforming the base GPT-4.1 model and OpenAI's o3 in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CLIO enhances LLM reasoning control, transparency, and accuracy, offering valuable tools in scientific decision-making and discovery processes.

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

### [6] [A Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning in Radiology Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02841)
*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent system to improve radiology visual question answering (RVQA) for chest X-ray images, outperforming existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based RVQA systems face issues like factual inaccuracies, hallucinations, and difficulties in aligning multimodal inputs.

Method: The authors design a multi-agent system composed of specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation, tested on a curated challenging RVQA dataset.

Result: Experiments show the system surpasses existing MLLM baselines in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The multi-agent system demonstrates potential for enhancing clinical AI applications requiring complex reasoning, offering improved explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [7] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark using the game of Countdown to evaluate planning capabilities of models, addressing flaws in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for assessing planning capabilities in models are inadequate and either lack formalization or are too niche.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark based on the game Countdown, leverages NP-complete problems, and created a dynamic instance generation procedure.

Result: The proposed benchmark is significantly more challenging for existing LLM-assisted planning approaches compared to other domains like the 24 Game.

Conclusion: Countdown is a robust and computationally challenging benchmark that effectively evaluates the planning capabilities of foundational models and agents.

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

### [8] [Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913)
*Carolina Minami Oguchi,Leo Wei,Koyo Kobayashi,Hsin-Tai Wu,Dipak Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using task vectors derived from reasoning LLMs to enhance Japanese Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring significant resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the resource-heavy challenges in improving the reasoning capabilities of Japanese LLMs by finding a more efficient approach.

Method: The method involves extracting reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs trained for specific tasks and applying these vectors to Japanese LLMs to enhance their performance.

Result: The approach showed significant performance improvement in Japanese LLMs despite limited resources.

Conclusion: Reasoning vectors provide a simple and effective solution to improve the reasoning abilities of Japanese LLMs, potentially inspiring similar advancements for other languages.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

### [9] [PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921)
*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge uses large language models to assess penetration testing agents' operations and achieves promising results in approximating human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of evaluating the operations of penetration testing agents in a scalable and holistic way, which cannot be effectively assessed programmatically.

Method: PentestJudge employs large language models as "judges," supported by rubrics that break down penetration testing tasks into simpler sub-tasks and criteria. The evaluations are based on a tree structure, comparing output to human experts' judgments for validation using metrics like F1 scores.

Result: The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, demonstrating that better tool-use correlates with higher accuracy. Different models tackled different question types with varying success. Cheaper models effectively judged the output of stronger models, pointing to easier verification compared to generation.

Conclusion: PentestJudge showcases potential in using LLMs to evaluate AI-driven penetration testing processes accurately. The methodology could guide future research in safely deploying security agents in sensitive environments.

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

### [10] [AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02936)
*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH is an LLM-powered agent for hydrological modeling, automating simulations and generating reports from natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for streamlined, automated hydrologic modeling systems that reduce complexity and bridge gaps between data, tools, and decision-making.

Method: AQUAH utilizes vision-enabled large language models to autonomously retrieve data, configure models, run simulations, and produce reports, guided by natural language inputs.

Result: Initial experiments show AQUAH can perform cold-start simulations for various U.S. basins and produce analyst-ready reports deemed clear and plausible by hydrologists.

Conclusion: AQUAH demonstrates significant promise in simplifying complex environmental modeling workflows, though further calibration and testing are necessary for operational use.

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

### [11] [MedBLINK: Probing Basic Perception in Multimodal Language Models for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02951)
*Mahtab Bigverdi,Wisdom Ikezogwo,Kevin Zhang,Hyewon Jeong,Mingyu Lu,Sungjae Cho,Linda Shapiro,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors introduce Medblink, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal language models (MLMs) on basic perceptual tasks in medical image interpretation, revealing significant performance gaps between current models and human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the gap in current MLMs' perceptual abilities, which are critical for clinical tasks such as determining image orientation or identifying CT scan types.

Method: The researchers created Medblink, a benchmark with 1,429 multiple-choice questions across eight tasks and various imaging modalities. They tested 19 MLMs against human annotators to compare accuracies.

Result: Human annotators achieved 96.4% accuracy, while the best-performing model only achieved 65%, highlighting MLMs' struggles with basic perceptual checks.

Conclusion: Current MLMs need improved visual grounding to gain clinician trust and effectively support medical decision-making.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

### [12] [Polymath: A Self-Optimizing Agent with Dynamic Hierarchical Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02959)
*Chia-Tung Ho,Jing Gong,Xufeng Yao,Yunsheng Bai,Abhishek B Akkur,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath is introduced as a self-optimizing agent that can dynamically refine its workflows to solve diverse real-world problems, achieving an 8.1% improvement over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies and inflexibility of current LLM-based systems that rely on manual embedding and labeled datasets, which are unsuitable for dynamic, real-world problems.

Method: Polymath uses a dynamic hierarchical workflow combining task flow graphs and code-based workflows. It optimizes using a combination of multi-grid-inspired graph optimization and self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithms, eliminating the need for labeled datasets.

Result: Polymath shows an 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods across six benchmark datasets, including tasks in coding, math, and multi-turn QA.

Conclusion: Polymath provides a flexible and effective automated approach for solving complex, real-world problems by refining its workflows without requiring labeled data, advancing the scalability and efficiency of general-purpose LLM-driven agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [13] [Defend LLMs Through Self-Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02961)
*Boshi Huang,Fabio Nonato de Paula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-conscious defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to counter prompt injection attacks, leveraging the LLM’s own reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks pose significant risks for LLM applications, and current external classifier solutions are inadequate for effective mitigation.

Method: The paper proposes a self-protection framework with Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, allowing LLMs to autonomously assess and regulate their responses.

Result: Experimental results across seven state-of-the-art LLMs show improved defense success rates, achieving near-perfect results in Enhanced Mode while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The self-conscious defense mechanism is a lightweight and cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, making it particularly suitable for generative AI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

### [14] [Unified Tool Integration for LLMs: A Protocol-Agnostic Approach to Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02979)
*Peng Ding,Rick Stevens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified tool integration approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify protocols, enhance performance, and reduce development complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented ecosystem of tool-augmented LLMs creates inefficiencies due to varied protocols, schema definitions, and execution workflows.

Method: They propose a protocol-agnostic design that includes automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and multi-source tool management.

Result: Experimental findings show a 60-80% reduction in code, performance gains of up to 3.1x via optimized concurrency, and compatibility with existing standards.

Conclusion: The study offers both theoretical insights and practical techniques for streamlining tool integration, enhancing LLM application development.

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM

*Fangyi Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the use of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators for their peers, detailing their evolution, effectiveness, and challenges, and underlining their potential to complement human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottleneck in evaluating outputs of advanced LLMs on complex tasks, where traditional methods like human evaluation face scalability and feasibility challenges.

Method: The paper explores the development of agent-as-a-judge systems, discussing variations from single-model judges to multi-agent frameworks, and compares them on metrics like reliability, cost, and alignment with human judgment.

Result: The research highlights the strengths and limitations of agent-based evaluation approaches, discusses their applications across multiple fields, and identifies critical challenges such as bias and robustness.

Conclusion: Agent-based judging offers a scalable and nuanced alternative to traditional evaluation methods but is best suited to complement rather than replace human oversight.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

*Yutong Wang,Pengliang Ji,Kaixin Li,Baolong Bi,Tao Feng,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BPO, a framework for improving large language reasoning models in long-horizon, sparse-reward interactive environments by combining bootstrapping, extrapolation, and iterative refinement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language reasoning models struggle with agentic planning due to challenges like sparse rewards and computational inefficiencies of verbose reasoning histories.

Method: The BPO framework includes (1) bootstrapping reasoning with planning quaternions and fusion techniques, (2) extrapolating via curriculum learning for out-of-distribution tasks, and (3) self-refinement through reward-gated experience selection.

Result: BPO achieves state-of-the-art token efficiency in interactive environments like ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop.

Conclusion: The proposed BPO framework demonstrates that reasoning models can be effectively adapted for agentic planning tasks, overcoming limitations in traditional approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

### [18] [Collab-Solver: Collaborative Solving Policy Learning for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03030)
*Siyuan Li,Yifan Yu,Yanchen Deng,Zhihao Zhang,Mengjing Chen,Fangzhou Zhu,Tao Zhong,Jianye Hao,Peng Liu,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The proposed Collab-Solver introduces a neural network-driven collaborative learning framework for MILP solving, replacing traditional hard-coded heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MILP solvers use isolated learning approaches for modules, which fail to account for interdependencies and reduce solving efficiency and quality.

Method: Collab-Solver uses a multi-agent framework with Stackelberg game formulation and a two-phase learning paradigm to optimize policies collaboratively.

Result: The learned policies improved solving speed and quality across synthetic and real-world large-scale MILP datasets, showing excellent generalization to new instance sets.

Conclusion: Collaborative policy learning offers a promising advancement in MILP solving by addressing module interdependence and achieving significant performance gains.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of GPT-2 models for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using in-context learning (ICL), showing robust accuracy and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the nonlinear mechanisms behind in-context learning (ICL) in natural language processing tasks by testing its ability to solve numerical problems like ODEs.

Method: The paper formulates standard ODE problems and solutions as sequential prompts and evaluates GPT-2's performance in solving these problems, analyzing its accuracy and generalization behavior.

Result: GPT-2 learns a meta-ODE algorithm with convergence comparable to or better than the Euler method and demonstrates exponential accuracy gains with more examples and robust extrapolation to out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: These results highlight the potential of in-context learning in large language models for addressing nonlinear numerical tasks and offer deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR) is a multi-agent framework that aims to enhance large language models (LLMs) for medical diagnosis by introducing structured reasoning and cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs face challenges with reasoning depth, leading to diagnostic errors in complex scenarios.

Method: ToR utilizes a tree structure for recording reasoning paths, combines clinical evidence, and employs cross-validation to ensure consistency among agents.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance of ToR compared to existing baseline methods on real-world medical data.

Conclusion: Tree-of-Reasoning enhances clinical reasoning in complex medical diagnoses, addressing shortcomings of current LLMs through structured reasoning and multi-agent consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

*Rui Pu,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Ha,Litian Zhang,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD), a framework that uses structured reasoning and reinforcement learning to combat jailbreak attacks on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective defense mechanisms against evolving jailbreak attacks, as existing methods fail to generalize against novel strategies.

Method: CDD employs structured cognitive reasoning and global/local prompt analysis, combined with supervised fine-tuning and entropy-guided reinforcement learning to uncover manipulations.

Result: CDD achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization capability to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning and reinforcement learning are effective tools for enhancing the robustness of language models against adversarial strategies.

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

### [22] [ContractEval: Benchmarking LLMs for Clause-Level Legal Risk Identification in Commercial Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03080)
*Shuang Liu,Zelong Li,Ruoyun Ma,Haiyan Zhao,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ContractEval, a benchmark for evaluating open-source and proprietary LLMs in identifying legal risks in contracts, and finds that while proprietary models outperform, open-source ones show promising potential with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of open-source LLMs in legal risk analysis, particularly in ensuring data confidentiality and performance in specialized legal tasks.

Method: The authors assessed 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) to evaluate their performance in identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts.

Result: Key findings include: proprietary LLMs outperform open-source models overall; larger open-source models perform better but with diminishing returns; reasoning mode improves effectiveness but decreases correctness; open-source models often fail to identify relevant clauses; and quantization improves efficiency but reduces performance.

Conclusion: While open-source LLMs hold potential, significant fine-tuning is needed to ensure their reliability in high-stakes legal scenarios. ContractEval serves as a benchmark for advancing legal-domain LLM development.

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

### [23] [EoH-S: Evolution of Heuristic Set using LLMs for Automated Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03082)
*Fei Liu,Yilu Liu,Qingfu Zhang,Xialiang Tong,Mingxuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate complementary sets of heuristics, improving optimization across diverse problem instances compared to single-heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AHD approaches are limited to designing a single heuristic, which struggles to generalize across varied problem instances. A better approach is needed to address this issue of generalization.

Method: The authors introduce AHSD, aiming to generate a small complementary set of heuristics. They propose the Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) method, which uses complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search to generate diverse and effective heuristics.

Result: EoH-S outperformed current AHD methods across three diverse tasks, achieving up to a 60% improvement in performance.

Conclusion: AHSD and EoH-S provide a significant advancement in AHD by enabling the generation of heuristic sets that better address diverse problem instances, demonstrating consistent and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MissDDIM is a conditional diffusion framework for tabular imputation, improving inference speed and reducing output variability compared to prior DDPM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DDPM-based methods for missing data imputation have limitations like high inference latency and variable outputs, which hinder their practical application in real-world tabular settings.

Method: MissDDIM leverages Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with conditional diffusion techniques to achieve deterministic outputs for tabular imputations while reducing inference latency.

Result: MissDDIM mitigates the variability in output and decreases inference latency, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: MissDDIM offers a more efficient and deterministic approach for tabular data imputation, resolving several drawbacks of existing DDPM-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

*Xingjun Ma,Hanxun Huang,Tianwei Song,Ye Sun,Yifeng Gao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2UE, a framework for generating Unlearnable Examples using text descriptions to protect personal data without requiring direct exposure to the original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of large-scale pre-training models on datasets containing private data raises privacy concerns, and current Unlearnable Examples methods require data exposure, creating a privacy paradox.

Method: The authors propose T2UE, which uses a text-to-image model and error-minimization framework to generate unlearnable noise based solely on textual descriptions of data, avoiding image data exposure.

Result: T2UE effectively degrades downstream task performance (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) across various architectures and settings, demonstrating its generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: T2UE proves the feasibility of zero-contact data protection, offering a scalable and private solution to safeguard personal data with only text descriptions.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

*Wenxin Mao,Zhitao Wang Long Wang,Sirong Chen,Cuiyun Gao,Luyang Cao,Ziming Liu,Qiming Zhang,Jun Zhou,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes UML2Dep, a framework for step-by-step code generation utilizing enhanced UML sequence diagrams and a data dependency inference task to address the ambiguity of plain textual requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language descriptions for code generation often lack specificity, leading to ambiguity in representing complex requirements, business logic, and system behaviors.

Method: UML2Dep combines enhanced UML diagrams with decision tables and API specs for clearer specifications, and integrates a data dependency inference (DDI) task formulated as a mathematical reasoning process for dependency graph creation.

Result: The framework reduces linguistic ambiguity, introduces a formalized approach to handling intricate data dependencies, and improves reasoning accuracy by leveraging LLMs' mathematical capacities.

Conclusion: UML2Dep advances code generation by converting complex requirements into formal specifications and leveraging structured reasoning, making the process more accurate and efficient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgentSME, a generative agent framework tailored for smart education using LLMs, analyzing three communication modes and validating their performance with six LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in generative agent models tailored for smart education, particularly focusing on the complexities caused by personalized human-to-human communication.

Method: The study introduces AgentSME with three communication modes (Solo, Mono, Echo) and evaluates them using six LLMs across accuracy and diversity metrics.

Result: The Echo communication mode achieved the highest accuracy, while DeepSeek showed the greatest diversity in reasoning contents.

Conclusion: AgentSME and its findings provide actionable insights for improving generative agent learning capabilities and advancing smart education frameworks.

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for reliable LLM agents capable of solving real-world optimization problems accurately while ensuring verifiability and scalable training.

Method: The method involves creating a synthetic data pipeline to generate training datasets with structured representations, natural language descriptions, and verified solutions. This enables fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality, verifiable demonstrations.

Result: The LLM agent, OptiTrust, achieved state-of-the-art results in six of seven datasets, outperforming the next-best algorithms by at least 8% on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable and verifiable methodology for building trustworthy LLM agents, showcasing their potential for real-world optimization tasks.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Motivation: To address the knowledge gap in environmental education and explore the potential of AI models to facilitate understanding of environmental concepts among students.

Method: The study utilized AI models and compared their responses to student performance in an Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), along with targeted questions.

Result: AI models demonstrated an extensive and valid knowledge base capable of supporting environmental education, but require human oversight for ensuring accuracy.

Conclusion: AI models are useful tools in environmental education but must be complemented by validation from human experts in environmental sciences.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Motivation: To aid researchers in causation analysis by determining the feasibility of estimating causal relationships before quantitative estimation.

Method: The package applies symbolic representations and algorithms for qualitative causal analysis using tools like ACMGs and domain-specific languages.

Result: The package simplifies causal query transformation into symbolic estimands and implements numerous recent identification algorithms.

Conclusion: The $Y_0$ package serves as a sophisticated toolkit for causal inference research, complementing theoretical advancements in the field.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve formal geometric reasoning, which existing models struggle with, especially when constructing and verifying auxiliary geometric elements.

Method: Developed Geoint-R1, an advanced multimodal reasoning framework integrating text, diagrams, auxiliary element construction, Lean4 formal reasoning, and interactive visualization. Proposed the Geoint benchmark with 1,885 annotated problems for systematic evaluation.

Result: Geoint-R1 outperformed existing models, particularly in tasks requiring explicit construction of auxiliary elements.

Conclusion: Geoint-R1 enhances formal geometric reasoning and presents a robust framework for scientific discovery and education.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying

Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inquiry-oriented education by addressing the challenges of traditional and rule-based partner selection methods, such as limited knowledge expansion and flexibility.

Method: The authors developed InqEduAgent, which employs generative agents to model cognitive features of learners and uses a Gaussian process-augmented matching algorithm for pairing learners with optimal partners.

Result: Experimental evidence demonstrates that InqEduAgent delivers superior matching performance across various learning scenarios and capabilities within the LLM environment.

Conclusion: The study advances both human-based and AI-enabled learning partnerships, enhancing flexibility and performance in inquiry-oriented educational settings.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with
different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent
allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based
learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at

### [35] [Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03251)
*Osama Mohammed,Jiaxin Pan,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to model dynamic entity behaviors, outperforming baselines in driver-intention prediction and Bitcoin fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dynamic interactions among entities over time is key in tasks like predicting driver maneuvers or detecting financial fraud.

Method: The authors propose a full-history graph representation separating intra-time-step and inter-time-step edges, and introduce ETDNet with parallel attention modules for learning.

Result: ETDNet improves prediction accuracy in driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Representing structural and temporal relations using distinct edges enhances predictive capabilities in dynamic entity interaction tasks.

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolVQA, a large-scale dataset aimed at improving tool-use reasoning in multimodal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LFMs struggle with real-world tool-use, especially in scenarios requiring diverse multimodal reasoning.

Method: The study uses ToolEngine, a DFS-based pipeline with dynamic example matching, to generate the ToolVQA dataset.

Result: ToolVQA includes 23K real-world instances and shows LFMs outperform GPT-3.5-turbo in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ToolVQA fosters enhanced tool-use proficiency in LFMs and contributes to bridging gaps in real-world multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

*Jiayan Nan,Wenquan Ma,Wenlong Wu,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nemori is a novel memory architecture for LLMs designed to address limitations in persistent memory, inspired by human cognition principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle in long-term tasks due to their lack of efficient memory systems.

Method: Nemori employs a Two-Step Alignment Principle for organizing conversations into episodes and a Predict-Calibrate Principle for learning adaptively.

Result: Experimental results show that Nemori consistently outperforms existing systems, especially in tasks with longer contexts.

Conclusion: Nemori offers a promising solution for autonomous agents in long-term workflows through innovative memory organization and learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on deploying LLM-based AI agents in edge environments, addressing challenges like resource constraints, latency, and migration complexity through an optimized framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies and latency issues associated with deploying AI agents in cloud environments, particularly for mobile and real-time applications.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework combining ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for AI agent placement and migration in distributed edge systems.

Result: The solution reduced deployment latency and migration costs when tested on distributed edge servers.

Conclusion: Adaptive placement and lightweight migration strategies improve efficiency and QoS for AI agents in dynamic edge environments.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel compression framework for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, leveraging step entropy to reduce redundancy and improve inference efficiency without major accuracy losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and redundancy in Chain-of-Thought reasoning within Large Language Models that lead to higher inference costs.

Method: Key contributions include introducing step entropy to identify redundant reasoning steps, pruning low-entropy steps, and employing a two-stage training tactic combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that utilizes [SKIP] tokens.

Result: The study demonstrates that 80% of redundant steps can be eliminated with minimal impact on accuracy, compared to random or high-entropy pruning which significantly degrades performance.

Conclusion: The compression framework enhances inference efficiency and maintains accuracy, potentially aiding practical LLM applications and advancing the understanding of reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'CogBench,' a benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to assess cognitive impairment across different languages and clinical settings. The study highlights the adaptability of LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting and lightweight fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of generalizability of current speech-based cognitive impairment assessment methods across different languages and clinical environments.

Method: The authors developed 'CogBench,' a benchmark based on a unified multimodal pipeline and tested LLM performance using datasets spanning English and Mandarin. They evaluated chain-of-thought prompting and lightweight fine-tuning via LoRA.

Result: Results indicate that conventional deep learning models perform poorly in cross-domain scenarios. LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting are more adaptable but highly sensitive to prompt design. Fine-tuning via LoRA significantly enhances model generalization.

Conclusion: The findings lay groundwork for developing linguistically robust and clinically useful tools for assessing cognitive impairment using speech.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares two neurosymbolic AI approaches—integrative and hybrid—for general logical reasoning, favoring the hybrid approach for its interpretability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with general, domain-agnostic logical reasoning in a deterministic and interpretable manner, spurring interest in neurosymbolic AI.

Method: The paper analyzes and compares the Logic Neural Network (LNN) and the LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS) as representatives of integrative and hybrid approaches to examine their potential in general logical reasoning.

Result: The hybrid approach, represented by LLM-SS, demonstrates greater promise due to its interpretable reasoning chain and its ability to leverage existing LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: The hybrid neurosymbolic approach is recommended for developing general logical reasoning, and a modular, generalizable framework based on LLM-SS is proposed for future work.

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

*Rui Zou,Mengqi Wei,Yutao Zhu,Jirong Wen,Xin Zhao,Jing Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a framework to improve large language models' ability to diagnose complex reasoning errors by using adversarial roles that co-evolve. Tested on math tasks, HSG outperforms existing models and contributes a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in reasoning and generation but struggle with diagnosing complex errors, largely due to training objectives emphasizing correct answers. This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors implement HSG, a dynamic adversarial framework consisting of two roles: Sneaky generates deceptive errors, and Diagnosis detects them. Through adversarial co-evolution, the framework enhances both error generation and diagnostic precision.

Result: The experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that HSG improves error diagnosis accuracy by 16.8%–31.4% over existing baseline models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: HSG effectively enhances the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs, presenting a new benchmark dataset to further research in addressing complex reasoning errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MOID, combining LLMs and multi-objective optimization to provide actionable suggestions for infeasible routing models, addressing practical diagnostic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing LLM-based methods that can diagnose issues in infeasible models but do not consider multiple possible adjustments to solve them.

Method: Introduces MOID, merging multi-objective optimization and LLMs. MOID generates trade-off solutions considering path cost and constraint violations and uses LLMs to analyze these to offer practical diagnostic insights.

Result: MOID is tested on 50 types of infeasible routing problems, automatically generating multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, outperforming other LLM-based methods in providing actionable insights.

Conclusion: MOID provides diverse and actionable insights for diagnosing and resolving infeasibility in routing problems, improving decision-making and model feasibility restoration over existing approaches.

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automatically extract and organize biomedical information using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs, creating enhanced quadruples for better contextual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians and researchers face difficulties due to the rapid growth of scientific literature that exceeds their ability to review and apply effectively.

Method: A pipeline involving LLM agents processes PubMed abstracts to extract knowledge graph triples, adds context variables, and enhances triples with open domain and ontology-based approaches.

Result: LLM extraction achieved an average cosine similarity of 0.874 between generated sentences and original propositions, with increased accuracy attributed to the inclusion of context variables.

Conclusion: The method supports centralized, real-time knowledge retrieval for medical practitioners and offers scalability to other fields of knowledge management.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

### [46] [Toward a Graph-Theoretic Model of Belief: Confidence, Credibility, and Structural Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03465)
*Saleh Nikooroo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph-based model for belief systems that captures both the structure and strength of beliefs, addressing limitations in existing probabilistic and logical frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representations of belief systems either oversimplify internal structure, obscure epistemic tensions, or cannot handle fragmented or contradictory states effectively.

Method: The authors introduce a framework where belief systems are represented as directed, weighted graphs, with individual beliefs as nodes, relationships as edges, and distinct functions for credibility (source trust) and confidence (internal support).

Result: This formalism enables the representation of epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction) without requiring global coherence or belief updating, and provides finer granularity than existing probabilistic or logical approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model allows for a richer classification of epistemic states and serves as a foundational tool for studying belief structures, coherence, and epistemic tensions.

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

### [47] [Semantic-aware Graph-guided Behavior Sequences Generation with Large Language Models for Smart Homes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03484)
*Zhiyao Xu,Dan Zhao,Qingsong Zou,Qing Li,Yong Jiang,Yuhang Wang,Jingyu Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartGen proposes an LLM-based framework to synthesize user behavior data for smart home models, addressing issues caused by behavioral drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral drift in smart homes causes models trained on static data to degrade over time, and collecting fresh data for retraining is unfeasible due to slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns.

Method: SmartGen includes components like Time and Semantic-aware Split, Sequence Compression, Graph-guided Synthesis, and a Two-stage Outlier Filter for generating context-aware synthetic behavior data.

Result: SmartGen improves anomaly detection by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51%, demonstrating effectiveness against behavioral drift, validated on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SmartGen enables continual adaptation of smart home models through synthetic data, overcoming challenges related to behavioral drift and retraining constraints.

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

### [48] [Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03500)
*Yijin Yang,Cristina Cornelio,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDCIM, a method for error detection and correction in interpretable mathematics tasks using LLMs paired with symbolic frameworks to enhance accuracy and optimize costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to intermediate reasoning errors, hallucinations, and failure to adhere to output formats, limiting their reliability in tasks requiring precise outputs like mathematical expressions.

Method: EDCIM combines LLMs for equation generation with a symbolic error-detection framework to identify and correct errors, while balancing cost and accuracy via a hyperparameter tuning mechanism.

Result: Experimental results show that EDCIM reduces computational and financial costs, while maintaining or improving accuracy depending on the cost-accuracy configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed EDCIM method effectively addresses reasoning errors and cost challenges in interpretable mathematics tasks, underscoring its potential as a practical solution for these issues.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

### [49] [Hidden Dynamics of Massive Activations in Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03616)
*Jorge Gallego-Feliciano,S. Aaron McClendon,Juan Morinelli,Stavros Zervoudakis,Antonios Saravanos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the emergence of massive activations in transformers during training and models their development using predictable mathematical patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of massive activations during transformer training, which were previously unexplored despite their critical role in model functionality.

Method: The analysis was conducted on the Pythia model family, examining transformer training across various model sizes and checkpoints. The authors mathematically modeled activation emergence using an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function.

Result: Massive activation emergence follows predictable patterns that were accurately modeled. A machine learning framework was developed to predict these mathematical parameters based solely on architectural designs.

Conclusion: Massive activations are influenced by model design and their behavior can be anticipated or controlled by design decisions before training. This has implications for model stability, optimization, and interpretability.

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

### [50] [Refining Critical Thinking in LLM Code Generation: A Faulty Premise-based Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03622)
*Jialin Li,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FPBench, an evaluation framework to assess large language models' (LLMs) handling of faulty premises in code generation, revealing shortcomings in reasoning and self-scrutiny.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations and poor performance in LLMs generated code when provided faulty premises.

Method: Develop FPBench, categorizing faulty premises and evaluating using multi-dimensional metrics across 15 LLMs.

Result: Observed poor reasoning, diminishing returns with increased input, and distinct defect activation patterns in different faulty premises categories.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for LLMs to verify input premises and offers FPBench as a pathway towards reliable code generation models.

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

*He Wang,Liang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Evo-MCTS, a novel approach combining evolutionary optimization, tree search, and large language model heuristics, achieving significant improvements in gravitational wave detection while enhancing interpretability and enabling broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for gravitational wave detection, such as matched filtering and deep neural networks, are limited by computational inefficiency and lack of interpretability, motivating the need for a better alternative.

Method: The researchers developed Evo-MCTS, a hybrid framework that systematically explores algorithmic spaces by integrating tree-structured searches, evolutionary optimization, and domain-aware physical constraints.

Result: Evo-MCTS achieved a 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms in gravitational wave detection on the MLGWSC-1 dataset and uncovered interpretable algorithmic variants with transferable methodologies.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS not only enhances performance and interpretability in gravitational wave detection but also suggests a scalable approach for automated discovery in computational science domains.

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

*Xufang Luo,Yuge Zhang,Zhiyuan He,Zilong Wang,Siyun Zhao,Dongsheng Li,Luna K. Qiu,Yuqing Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Lightning is a framework that simplifies RL training for LLM-based AI agents, allowing seamless integration with existing systems and improving their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tightly coupled RL training and agent integration, and to provide an adaptable and modular framework for training AI agents in complex workflows.

Method: The framework uses a hierarchical RL algorithm called LightningRL with a credit assignment module to decompose agent trajectories into training transitions. It introduces a unified data interface and follows a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture for interoperability.

Result: Agent Lightning delivers stable and continuous performance improvements when applied to tasks such as text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and mathematical tool-use.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and scalable solution for training LLM-based AI agents, enabling their deployment in real-world dynamic and multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

TL;DR: Vision Mamba improves over transformers using State Space Models (SSMs) for computer vision tasks to reduce memory and computational needs, and Mamba-X optimizes it further for hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and memory limitations in transformer models and make Vision Mamba efficient for edge device deployment.

Method: Adaptation of Vision Mamba using SSMs with a systolic scan array for parallel processing in Mamba-X, and hybrid quantization for enhanced hardware efficiency.

Result: Mamba-X reduces latency, memory usage, and improves hardware efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Mamba-X successfully addresses computational challenges for edge devices, making Vision Mamba viable for efficient computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have proven effective in language modeling but are limited by
high computational and memory demands that grow quadratically with input
sequence length. State space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative by
reducing attention complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ while also lowering
overall memory consumption. Vision Mamba adapts the SSM approach for computer
vision tasks, achieving lower latency and memory consumption than traditional
transformer models. However, deploying Vision Mamba on edge devices is
challenging due to its sequential scan operations, which hinder GPU efficiency.
We propose Mamba-X, an end-to-end Vision Mamba accelerator that includes a
systolic scan array to maximize parallelism and minimize memory traffic, along
with a hybrid, hardware-friendly quantization technique to reduce memory usage
and improve hardware efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

*Peijing Li,Muhammad Shahir Abdurraman,Rachel Cleaveland,Sergey Legtchenko,Philip Levis,Ioan Stefanovici,Thierry Tambe,David Tennenhouse,Caroline Trippel*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper suggests a shift from traditional memory architectures to new specialized forms tailored to application-specific access patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory scaling for SRAM and DRAM has reached a halt, leading to their increasing dominance in system costs.

Method: The authors propose two new memory classes, LtRAM and StRAM, designed for specific data lifetimes and access patterns, and explore potential underlying technologies.

Result: The study identifies technologies and challenges for integrating specialized memory into current design frameworks to meet emerging requirements.

Conclusion: Transitioning to these new memory architectures is imperative for creating more efficient and scalable computing systems.

Abstract: Both SRAM and DRAM have stopped scaling: there is no technical roadmap to
reduce their cost (per byte/GB). As a result, memory now dominates system cost.
This paper argues for a paradigm shift from today's simple memory hierarchy
toward specialized memory architectures that exploit application-specific
access patterns. Rather than relying solely on traditional off-chip DRAM and
on-chip SRAM, we envisage memory systems equipped with additional types of
memory whose performance trade-offs benefit workloads through non-hierarchical
optimization. We propose two new memory classes deserving explicit OS support:
long-term RAM (LtRAM) optimized for read-intensive data with long lifetimes,
and short-term RAM (StRAM) designed for transient, frequently-accessed data
with short lifetimes. We explore underlying device technologies that could
implement these classes, including their evolution and their potential
integration into current system designs given emerging workload requirements.
We identify critical research challenges to realize what we believe is a
necessary evolution toward more efficient and scalable computing systems
capable of meeting future demands.

TL;DR: ICARE is a novel framework for evaluating radiology report generation models, offering clinical precision and recall measures through interpretable large language model agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated radiology report assessment metrics rely on surface-level comparisons and lack interpretability, which impedes safe clinical deployment.

Method: ICARE utilizes large language models and dynamic multiple-choice question answering to evaluate generated radiology reports in terms of clinical precision and recall.

Result: Clinician studies demonstrate ICARE's superior alignment with expert judgment compared to other methods, and analyses confirm its sensitivity to clinical content.

Conclusion: ICARE offers a transparent and interpretable evaluation framework with enhanced reliability for assessing radiology report generation models.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEM-MoE, a model to handle annotator disagreement by incorporating demographic-based subnetworks and utilizing synthetic data for improvement, achieving competitive and scalable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotator disagreement is a common challenge in subjective NLP tasks, and current methods lack effective representation of structured, group-level variation.

Method: The proposed DEM-MoE model routes inputs to subnetworks based on annotator demographics. It also utilizes synthetic annotations, generated via zero-shot persona prompting using LLMs, to address sparse demographic representation. Strategies for blending real and synthetic data tailored to specific dataset structures are also evaluated.

Result: DEM-MoE outperforms prior models on datasets with high annotator disagreement, shows competitive performance across demographic groups, and demonstrates the utility of synthetic data for enriching training datasets.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of demographic-aware modeling and synthetic data augmentation for subjective NLP tasks, providing scalable methods to enhance the representation of diverse perspectives and improve performance on high-disagreement datasets.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

### [57] [Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872)
*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a novel approach for preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking attacks on LLMs by separating the processing pipeline into a highlighter and summarizer, avoiding direct exposure of the user question to the generative LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking and model hijacking attacks, where maliciously crafted prompts can lead to undesirable outputs or misuse of the model.

Method: The proposed method, Highlight & Summarize (H&S), splits the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline into two components: a highlighter identifies relevant documents or passages based on the user query, while a summarizer consolidates these into a final response, ensuring the generative LLM never directly encounters the user's question.

Result: The study evaluates various implementations of the H&S design and finds that it not only prevents attacks by design but also improves the correctness, relevance, and quality of the responses. Notably, responses from an LLM-based highlighter often outperform traditional RAG pipelines.

Conclusion: H&S is a promising solution for enhancing the security and robustness of LLM systems against adversarial inputs, demonstrating better performance and reliability compared to standard pipelines.

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

*Elliot Murphy,Rohan Venkatesh,Edward Khokhlovich,Andrey Vyshedskiy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the computational operation of syntax 'Merge,' highlighting distinct cognitive mechanisms underlying different types of sentence comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neurocognitive basis of the syntactic operation 'Merge' and explore whether different sentence structures rely on distinct mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyzed participants’ comprehension of sentences with varying levels of syntactic complexity and conducted clustering analyses to identify structural differences.

Result: The study found behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, each potentially linked to unique cognitive mechanisms or developmental stages.

Conclusion: While 'Merge' might have evolved suddenly, its processing relies on different cognitive mechanisms, which could explain selective impairments and varied developmental trajectories.

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

*Wenjie Luo,Ruocheng Li,Shanshan Zhu,Julian Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF) to improve common sense reasoning in vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with complex, multi-step, cross-modal reasoning tasks, often producing shallow or inconsistent inferences. The motivation is to address these shortcomings and enable deeper, more coherent problem-solving.

Method: CMRF is a framework with three main components: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking tasks into smaller questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for generating logical inferences, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating consistency. It uses an Adaptive Iterative Refinement strategy to enhance reasoning step-by-step.

Result: CMRF outperforms open-source LVLMs, achieving a 69.4% accuracy on benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. This is 2.4 percentage points higher than the previous state-of-the-art among open-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances reasoning capabilities in LVLMs, particularly in complex tasks, validating the effectiveness of its iterative approach and modular components.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the connection between sensorial language and stylistic features using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) method, effectively predicting sensorial language with fewer parameters through SLIM-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how sensorial language, tied to human sensory experiences, is related to traditional stylistic features and to advance modeling techniques for efficient and interpretable language analysis.

Method: They employ Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) and introduce SLIM-LLMs, which use low-dimensional representations of LIWC features to capture stylistic information and model non-linear language relationships.

Result: SLIM-LLMs, utilizing reduced-rank LIWC features, match the performance of full-scale language models across multiple genres while significantly decreasing model parameters by up to 80%.

Conclusion: The study underscores the efficiency and interpretability of reduced-dimension models in capturing sensorial language, offering a promising direction for stylistic analysis in diverse applications.

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast and effective method to detect adversarial prompts in LLMs using Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices, achieving strong results even with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are complex and vulnerable to adversarial attacks like jailbreaks that can generate harmful responses. There's a need for robust detection mechanisms.

Method: The paper employs Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors to analyze latent spaces for detecting adversarial prompts, leveraging patterns even with limited labeled data.

Result: The proposed method achieves an F1 score of 0.83 and operates far faster, with speedups from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to baselines, using just 0.5% labeled data.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates both efficiency and effectiveness for detection of adversarial prompts, especially in data-scarce scenarios, making it valuable for safe use of LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

TL;DR: The study examines English-language discourse on AI-generated art over 12 years, highlighting a misalignment between artists' perspectives and dominant media narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the marginalization of artists’ voices in discussions about AI-generated art and its implications on creative labor.

Method: A twelve-year analysis (2013-2025) of curated excerpts using BERTopic-based methodology, clustering discourse into five thematic groups.

Result: Findings show technical jargon often serves as gatekeeping, sidelining artists' concerns in favor of prevailing media narratives.

Conclusion: There is a need for transparent engagement with artists' perspectives in AI art discussions, supported by the provided methodology for future research.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

### [64] [Privacy-Aware Decoding: Mitigating Privacy Leakage of Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03098)
*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a lightweight method to protect sensitive data in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by adding Gaussian noise during token generation, ensuring differential privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that enhance language models with external knowledge pose privacy risks, especially when involving sensitive or private data, making them vulnerable to information leakage.

Method: The proposed Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD) method injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during inference to protect high-risk tokens. It employs confidence-based screening, sensitivity estimation, and context-aware noise calibration, along with a rigorous differential privacy tracking mechanism for per-response guarantees.

Result: Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets reveal that PAD effectively reduces private data leakage while maintaining the quality of responses, surpassing current retrieval- and post-processing-based privacy methods.

Conclusion: PAD provides a computationally lightweight, model-agnostic solution to enhance privacy in RAG systems by operating solely at decoding time. It demonstrates promise as a generalizable and scalable defense against privacy risks in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

*Yangtian Zi,Harshitha Menon,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PartialOrderEval to study how prompt specificity affects the performance of LLMs on general and specialized code generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well on general benchmarks but struggle with specialized ones, prompting the need to explore whether missing domain knowledge or insufficiently detailed prompts are responsible.

Method: The authors introduced PartialOrderEval, a framework that arranges prompts from minimal to maximally detailed, and applied it to diverse code generation benchmarks.

Result: Experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder reveal varying prompt sensitivity and highlight key factors like explicit specifications that impact effectiveness.

Conclusion: Prompt specificity plays a significant role in the performance of LLMs, particularly for specialized tasks, indicating that enhancing prompt detail can improve outcomes.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Token-level Precise Attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TPARAG) to expose vulnerabilities in RAG systems, outperforming previous attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) can suffer from hallucinations and outdated information, prompting reliance on the RAG framework. This paper seeks to understand and address security vulnerabilities within this setup.

Method: TPARAG strategically creates token-optimized malicious passages, ensuring retrievability and enhancing attack success rates in generation stages for both white-box and black-box RAG systems.

Result: Experiments show that TPARAG surpasses earlier methods in both retrieval and end-to-end attack precision using open-domain QA datasets.

Conclusion: Critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines are exposed, emphasizing the need for enhanced robustness and providing valuable insights for improvement.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes the alignment and divergence of sentiments and emotions in English-Arabic comparable texts, using annotated labels, emotion lexicons, and statistical measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how topics are discussed across languages by focusing on sentiment and emotion differences in comparable English-Arabic texts, particularly when documents come from different sources.

Method: Texts are annotated with sentiment and emotion labels using opinion classification methods to minimize reliance on machine translation. An English WordNet-Affect lexicon is translated into Arabic to create bilingual emotion lexicons for labeling comparable corpora.

Result: The analysis finds that sentiment and emotion annotations align for texts from the same news agency but diverge for texts from different agencies.

Conclusion: The proposed annotation and comparison methods are language-independent, offering generalizability for analyzing sentiment and emotion differences in other language pairs.

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

### [68] [Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03137)
*Ge Shi,Kaiyu Huang,Guochen Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent Story Generator leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance outline-based long story generation by mitigating theme drift and improving narrative coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for long story generation suffer from theme drift and repetitive, incoherent plots, making the narratives less appealing to readers.

Method: The proposed approach incorporates a memory storage model with both long-term and short-term memory to prevent theme drift, introduces a story theme obstacle framework based on narratology, and enables multi-agent interaction to refine coherence and incorporate user feedback.

Result: Experiments show that stories generated by this method exhibit improved quality in terms of narrative coherence and appeal compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The integration of memory storage, narratology-inspired frameworks, and multi-agent interaction significantly boosts long story generation quality, addressing key challenges of theme drift and narrative appeal deficiencies.

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RCP-Merging, a framework to efficiently merge domain-specific models with Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models, enhancing domain performance while preserving reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model possessing both domain-specific knowledge and long chain-of-thought reasoning abilities efficiently, avoiding the computational challenges and performance issues of traditional merging methods.

Method: RCP-Merging framework prioritizes reasoning model weights as foundational and uses reasoning capability indicators to maintain long CoT reasoning capacity while selectively merging domain-specific weights.

Result: RCP-Merging outperformed state-of-the-art methods, improving domain task performance by up to 9.5% without significantly degrading long CoT reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective integration of domain-specific and reasoning models, achieving a dual-capability system that maintains performance in both focus areas.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies lazy reasoning as a cause for poor instruction adherence in LLMs and proposes a framework for rigorous reasoning methods, achieving significant advancements in instruction-following benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inconsistency of large language models (LLMs) in accurately following complex instructions, pinpointing lazy reasoning during thinking as the root cause.

Method: The proposed method involves generating complex instruction prompts, filtering them into categories, employing rejection sampling for dataset refinement, using entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT), and token-wise entropy-adaptive reinforcement learning (TEA-RL).

Result: Experiments show substantial performance improvements on instruction-following benchmarks across various model scales. Their Light-IF-32B model outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities through rigorous processes, achieving superior instruction adherence and generalizable reasoning capabilities with preview and self-checking features.

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution of political discourse in the German parliament, focusing on topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific strategies.

Method: Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment classification were developed and trained on a labeled dataset, achieving AUROC scores of 0.94 and 0.89 respectively. They were used to analyze trends across time and parties.

Result: The analysis revealed significant links between parliamentary roles and discourse style, including shifts in language when parties transition between government and opposition.

Conclusion: Political discourse in the Bundestag evolves due to ideological and governing roles, with machine learning offering valuable insights into these dynamics.

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how grammatical gender in different languages affects visual biases in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, finding systematic effects of grammatical markers on representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how grammatical gender influences the visual representation of AI-generated images and examine biases in multilingual Text-to-Image models.

Method: A benchmark dataset was created across five gendered languages and two control languages, using prompts designed to contradict stereotypical gender associations. 28,800 images were generated and analyzed across three T2I models.

Result: Grammatical gender significantly impacts image representation, with masculine markers increasing male depictions and feminine markers increasing female depictions. These effects vary based on language resource availability and model architecture.

Conclusion: Language structure influences biases in T2I models, highlighting the need to consider grammatical gender when addressing fairness in AI systems.

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses methods for anonymizing private information in data required for language model training, particularly in domain-agnostic NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect private information in line with regulations like GDPR while enabling the training of language models using extensive data.

Method: Explores and evaluates pre-processing methods, such as masking and pseudonymization, to anonymize private information in text.

Result: Establishes the utility of certain anonymization techniques for mitigating privacy risks in domain-agnostic NLP applications.

Conclusion: Anonymizing sensitive information, though imperfect, is crucial for privacy protection in NLP, and several pre-processing approaches can be applied effectively.

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

*Pablo J. Diego-Simón,Emmanuel Chemla,Jean-Rémi King,Yair Lakretz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the biases, challenges, and limitations of structural probes in LLMs using controlled benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze how structural and statistical factors influence syntactic representations in LLMs and assess the reliability of structural probes.

Method: Conducted in-depth analysis of structural probes using three controlled benchmarks to test biases and assess their performance against linguistic properties.

Result: Identified three key results: probes are biased by word proximity, struggle with deep syntactic structures, and are unaffected by word predictability.

Conclusion: Structural probes face challenges in reliably representing syntax in LLMs; controlled benchmarks are proposed for better evaluation.

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.
Providing a benchmark made of controlled stimuli to better evaluate their
performance.

*Shintaro Sakai,Jisun An,Migyeong Kang,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs replicate cultural patterns in reporting depression symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs reflect cultural differences in symptom reporting, given their growing mental health applications.

Method: Prompted LLMs with Western and Eastern cultural personas in English and major Eastern languages to test their responses.

Result: LLMs fail to replicate cultural patterns in English but show improved alignment in Eastern languages. Issues identified include low cultural sensitivity and a strong, invariant symptom hierarchy.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the cultural awareness necessary for reliable mental health uses.

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

*Deborah Dore,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RooseBERT, a pre-trained language model tailored for political discourse analysis, demonstrates superior results compared to general-purpose models across four tasks like sentiment analysis and argument detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of analyzing political discourse and debates, a domain where current language models underperform due to the specific language and hidden argumentative strategies used.

Method: The authors pre-trained RooseBERT using large-scale political debate corpora and fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks: named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection, and argument relation prediction.

Result: RooseBERT achieved significant performance improvements over general-purpose language models in all four tasks, showcasing the value of domain-specific pre-training.

Conclusion: Specialized pre-training on political discourse is crucial for enhancing analytical performance. RooseBERT contributes to advancing computational methods for political debate analysis and is made available for researchers.

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

### [79] [Exploring Stability-Plasticity Trade-offs for Continual Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03259)
*Duzhen Zhang,Chenxing Li,Jiahua Dong,Qi Liu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) to balance old knowledge retention and new knowledge acquisition, surpassing prior methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CNER methods overemphasize stability through Knowledge Distillation (KD), which hinders the model's ability to acquire new knowledge, leading to the need for a balanced trade-off between stability and plasticity.

Method: The proposed SPT method integrates a pooling operation to enhance plasticity and dynamically merges old and new model weights with a selective mechanism to prioritize important weights. It also introduces confidence-based pseudo-labeling for handling the semantic shift of the non-entity type.

Result: The SPT method surpasses previous CNER approaches across ten settings on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating better stability-plasticity trade-offs.

Conclusion: The SPT method effectively balances stability and plasticity in CNER tasks, overcoming limitations of prior methods and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to predict human behavior in economic decision-making using data from 522 real human personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how well LLMs can replicate or simulate actual human economic behavior using real-world data.

Method: Comparative analysis of three multimodal LLMs by evaluating their performance in Pay-What-You-Want pricing experiments with detailed persona information.

Result: LLMs performed poorly on individual-level predictions but showed reasonable accuracy in group-level behavioral patterns. Advanced prompting methods did not significantly outperform simpler ones.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for group-level analysis, their limitations in precise individual-level predictions highlight areas for improvement in persona-based simulations, as explored in computational social science.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spaced repetition systems struggle with semantic interference and adaptability in personalized learning, especially for test-oriented learning like language examinations.

Method: The proposed LECTOR algorithm integrates large language models for semantic analysis and personalized learning profiles to assess semantic similarity and apply spaced repetition principles.

Result: Evaluation against six baseline algorithms using simulated learners over 100 days showed LECTOR achieving a 90.2% success rate, outperforming the best baseline (88.4%) and handling semantic similarity effectively.

Conclusion: LECTOR is a computationally efficient and effective system to enhance adaptive learning, showcasing its potential for intelligent tutoring applications and reducing semantic confusion in vocabulary learning.

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

*Terra Blevins,Susanne Schmalwieser,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores linguistic convergence in large language models (LLMs)—their ability to adapt stylistically to users' language patterns—and evaluates their performance across dialogues, models, and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can mimic the human tendency of linguistic convergence during conversations, addressing a gap in understanding how LLM-generated language resembles human communication.

Method: The authors compare LLMs' completion of dialogue turns to real human responses across 16 models, three dialogue datasets, and stylometric features, systematically evaluating their convergence behavior.

Result: LLMs show strong stylistic convergence to conversations but often overfit compared to humans. Larger and instruction-tuned models converge less than smaller, pretrained ones, indicating variability in model behaviors.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs and humans exhibit distinct convergence mechanisms, as evidenced by feature-specific patterns and the role of model training settings.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

*Shahed Masoudian,Gustavo Escobedo,Hannah Strauss,Markus Schedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how large language models (LLMs) reflect and amplify gender biases in generative storytelling tasks using psychological gender stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address implicit gender biases in LLM-generated longer-form narratives, as these biases have broader implications for applications and ethical AI design.

Method: Introduced a dataset, StereoBias-Stories, with narrative tasks conditioned on combinations of psychological stereotypes. They analyzed how LLMs respond to gender-associated attributes in story generation.

Result: (1) Unconditioned prompts are biased towards males. (2) Attributes linked to male stereotypes amplify bias, whereas those tied to female stereotypes reduce it. (3) Larger models correlate more strongly with psychological stereotype categorizations.

Conclusion: There is a need for psychology-based evaluations to better understand and mitigate bias in LLMs, given the models’ alignment with gender stereotypes and their variations in bias behavior.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well professors and Large Language Models (LLMs) can predict the difficulty of True/False exam questions, finding that LLMs outperform professors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of exam assessments by accurately predicting the difficulty of exam questions, given that professors often struggle with this task.

Method: The paper compared human professors and various LLM-based methods in predicting the percentage of students answering correctly, leveraging LLM uncertainties and a supervised learning approach.

Result: The LLMs outperformed professors in distinguishing between easy and difficult questions, with supervised learning using LLM uncertainty yielding the best results.

Conclusion: Supervised learning techniques that use LLM uncertainties can enhance professors' abilities to estimate question difficulty, ultimately improving assessment quality.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

*Anqi Li,Wenwei Jin,Jintao Tong,Pengda Qin,Weijia Li,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hi-Guard is a multimodal moderation framework designed to enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and policy alignment of content moderation systems on social platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation systems struggle with noisy label-driven learning and opaque decisions that hinder human review, while also lacking direct alignment with moderation rules.

Method: Hi-Guard utilizes a hierarchical pipeline for filtering and classification, incorporates moderation rules into model prompts, employs a hierarchical taxonomy for classification, and introduces a multi-level soft-margin reward optimized by GRPO.

Result: Extensive experiments and deployments show Hi-Guard excels in classification accuracy, policy generalization, and decision interpretability.

Conclusion: Hi-Guard provides a scalable and transparent solution for improving content safety systems, achieving better compliance and trustworthiness with evolving moderation policies.

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

*Zhende Song,Shengji Tang,Peng Ye,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS), introducing a framework called CTTS-MM that combines multiple agents and multiple reward models for improved results in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of single-agent scaling methods in enhancing LLMs during inference without additional training, by exploring multi-agent and multi-reward-model paradigms.

Method: Three paradigms are presented: SA-MR, MA-SR, and MA-MR, with focus on MA-MR for collaborative inference. The CTTS-MM framework combines Agent Collaboration Search (ACS) and Mixture of Reward Models (MoR) for optimal performance through curated question pools and reward model selection techniques.

Result: Experiments across seven benchmarks show that CTTS-MM consistently results in superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaborations effectively enhance inference in LLMs, and the CTTS-MM framework provides a promising direction for future research and applications.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Taggus, a pipeline to extract social networks from Portuguese fiction works, demonstrating significant improvement over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing tools in character and interaction identification within literary fiction, particularly in Portuguese, as these tools underperform due to insufficient annotated data.

Method: Taggus utilizes part-of-speech (POS) tagging combined with heuristics to extract social networks, achieving tasks like character identification, co-reference resolution, and interaction detection.

Result: Taggus achieves an average F1-Score of 94.1% for character identification and co-reference resolution, and 75.9% for interaction detection, showing a 50.7% and 22.3% improvement, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art tools.

Conclusion: Taggus is a promising development for processing literary works in Portuguese, demonstrating high performance and addressing shortcomings in existing methods. Future improvements in relationship detection are outlined.

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

*Haotian Wu,Bo Xu,Yao Shu,Menglin Yang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new in-context learning (ICL) paradigm called JointThinking that combines two reasoning modes for large language models to improve reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of in-context learning in reasoning large language models, an aspect that has been less studied compared to their training and inference strategies.

Method: JointThinking involves prompting the model to generate two answers in parallel using two reasoning modes (Thinking and Nothinking). If the two answers are inconsistent, a second round of reasoning is triggered with a prompt that includes the original question and both answers. This approach uses structured diversity in reasoning modes to improve accuracy.

Result: JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting in terms of reasoning accuracy and robustness. It achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based methods on in-distribution tasks and excels on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: The method shows that structured diversity in reasoning modes improves accuracy and robustness of reasoning models. This scalability grows with increased model size in subsequent reasoning rounds. The study also identifies the limitations and provides guidelines for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of undiagnosed depression by leveraging user-generated social media content to link language with DSM-5 depression criteria for better detection and interpretation.

Method: Created ReDSM5 corpus with annotations of Reddit posts at sentence-level for DSM-5 depression symptoms by licensed psychologists, including clinical rationales.

Conclusion: ReDSM5 facilitates models that detect depression symptoms with improved clinical relevance and interpretability, providing a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

### [90] [Variety Is the Spice of Life: Detecting Misinformation with Dynamic Environmental Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03420)
*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yiming Wang,Changchun Li,Jiaxu Cui,Renchu Guan,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of misinformation detection using a dynamic framework called MISDER, consisting of social environmental representation and temporal models, outperforming traditional static methods in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inadequacy of static approaches to misinformation detection in dynamically evolving social scenarios, where the veracity of news can change over time.

Method: The paper introduces MISDER, a framework that dynamically learns social environmental representations and applies three types of temporal models (LSTM, ODE, Pre-trained systems) for misinformation detection.

Result: Experimental results across two datasets demonstrate that MISDER significantly outperforms various baseline approaches in misinformation detection.

Conclusion: MISDER's dynamic approach proves effective, suggesting the importance of incorporating evolving social environmental representations for improving misinformation detection methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

### [91] [LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03440)
*Junhong Wu,Jinliang Lu,Zixuan Ren,Ganqiang Hu,Zhi Wu,Dai Dai,Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the concept of 'Soft Thinking' in large language models (LLMs), revealing that LLMs primarily rely on the most influential aspects of soft inputs, thus limiting reasoning diversity. It proposes randomness techniques like Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick to enhance performance, achieving improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of traditional reasoning models that generate discrete tokens and explore how LLMs can adopt 'Soft Thinking' to operate in continuous concept spaces more effectively.

Method: The study used probing techniques to analyze LLM behavior, identified reliance on dominant soft input components, and introduced sampling strategies like Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick to incorporate controlled randomness in reasoning.

Result: The experiments show that incorporating randomness, particularly through the Gumbel-Softmax trick, improves performance on eight reasoning benchmarks, overcoming key limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: Adding controlled randomness to soft inputs allows LLMs to better utilize 'Soft Thinking,' fostering diverse reasoning paths and achieving enhanced performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

### [92] [Cropping outperforms dropout as an augmentation strategy for training self-supervised text embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03453)
*Rita González-Márquez,Philipp Berens,Dmitry Kobak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores contrastive learning strategies for creating text embeddings and compares cropping with dropout augmentations, finding cropping superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of self-supervised methods in generating high-quality text embeddings for various NLP tasks.

Method: Evaluated text embedding quality using augmentation strategies (cropping and dropout) and analyzed their impact on in-domain and out-of-domain performance, along with layer-wise transformer modifications during fine-tuning.

Result: Cropping-based augmentation outperformed dropout in embedding creation for in-domain tasks but fell below supervised State-of-the-Art on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: Self-supervised fine-tuning with cropping augmentation yields high-quality text embeddings in-domain, and fine-tuning the last transformer layers is sufficient for achieving competitive embedding quality.

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim
Retrieval is approached as a Learning-to-Rank task using a bi-encoder model
fine-tuned from a pre-trained transformer optimized for sentence similarity.
Training used both the source languages and their English translations for
multilingual retrieval and only English translations for cross-lingual
retrieval. Using lightweight models with fewer than 500M parameters and
training on Kaggle T4 GPUs, the method achieved 92% Success@10 in multilingual
and 80% Success@10 in 5th in crosslingual and 10th in multilingual tracks.

*Kaiwen Zhao,Bharathan Balaji,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenge of analyzing unstructured and inconsistent sustainability reports in PDF format by introducing CarbonPDF-QA dataset and CarbonPDF technique for accurate carbon footprint question-answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF sustainability reports, for efficient analysis of carbon footprint data.

Method: The paper introduces CarbonPDF-QA, a dataset with 1735 PDF reports and annotated Q&A pairs, and fine-tunes Llama 3 to develop CarbonPDF, a specialized LLM-based technique for carbon footprint question-answering.

Result: CarbonPDF achieves superior performance compared to existing techniques and systems fine-tuned on table and text data, demonstrating its capability in handling inconsistent data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CarbonPDF improves question-answering performance on unstructured sustainability reports and provides a robust solution for analyzing environmental impacts in PDF report formats.

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

*Md Rakibul Hasan,Md Zakir Hossain,Aneesh Krishna,Shafin Rahman,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents UPLME, a probabilistic framework for empathy regression that addresses noisy self-reported labels. It outperforms existing methods on benchmarks with label noise and improves uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning models for empathy regression face challenges due to the noisy nature of self-reported empathy scores, and existing methods for noisy label handling in regression settings are underdeveloped.

Method: UPLME predicts both empathy scores and uncertainty using probabilistic language modeling, Bayesian concepts, variational model ensembling, and introduces two new loss components to address uncertainty quantification and input pair similarity.

Result: UPLME achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks for empathy detection, demonstrates resilience against noisy labels, and improves calibration error over existing uncertainty quantification methods.

Conclusion: UPLME is an effective and robust framework for handling noisy labels in empathy regression settings, improving both prediction accuracy and label noise modeling.

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark for evaluating language models (LLMs) across various tasks in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano, revealing existing model limitations in these languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the lack of focus on Filipino and Philippine languages in large language models (LLMs) research and address the need for evaluation benchmarks specific to these languages.

Method: Developed FilBench, a benchmark tailored to Filipino-centric tasks, and evaluated 27 state-of-the-art LLMs, considering trends in Filipino NLP like Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation.

Result: Evaluation showed several LLMs struggled with reading comprehension and translation. GPT-4o, the best-performing model, scored 72.23%, while SEA-LION v3 70B performed worst for specialized Southeast Asian language training with 61.07%.

Conclusion: FilBench proves crucial for advancing NLP research in Filipino languages, revealing gaps in LLM capabilities and promoting inclusiveness for Philippine languages in model development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's official languages hinders advancements in multilingual NLP despite the presence of scattered resources.

Method: Marito aggregates, cleans, and standardizes fragmented terminological resources into open datasets under the Africa-centered NOODL framework.

Result: Integration of Marito into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline significantly improves English-to-Tshivenda translation in accuracy and domain-specific coherence.

Conclusion: Marito offers a scalable foundation for equitable NLP development, ensuring representation of South Africa's linguistic diversity in technology.

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity
is represented in the digital age.

### [98] [EmbedGrad: Gradient-Based Prompt Optimization in Embedding Space for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03533)
*Xiaoming Hou,Jiquan Zhang,Zibin Lin,DaCheng Tao,Shengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmbedGrad, a framework for tuning foundation models by optimizing text prompt embeddings for diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting foundation models effectively to various tasks is challenging, and existing methods (text prompt engineering or additional parameters) lack precision or add complexity. A new approach is needed to refine task adaptation.

Method: EmbedGrad uses gradient-based optimization to refine text prompt embeddings. Training adjusts embeddings with labeled data, while deployment integrates only optimized embeddings without altering semantic meaning.

Result: EmbedGrad significantly enhanced task performance, such as raising mathematical reasoning accuracy from 14.74% to 58.96% for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B. Consistent gains were achieved across models from 0.5B to 14B parameters and multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The study positions embedding refinement as a promising alternative to traditional task adaptation methods, balancing efficiency and precision without requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAGER, a framework to improve human-aligned scoring in large language models by leveraging internal representations from middle-to-upper layers, surpassing traditional final-layer approaches in alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current "LLM-as-a-judge" models often fail to align well with human preferences without requiring complicated prompts or fine-tuning.

Method: LAGER aggregates logits from multiple layers of the language model and calculates expected scores via a softmax-based distribution, keeping the LLM backbone frozen.

Result: LAGER achieves up to a 7.5% improvement over baselines in alignment benchmarks and is effective in downstream tasks like emotional understanding and data selection.

Conclusion: LAGER aligns more closely with human judgment scores, overcoming limitations of relying solely on final-layer representations and performing competitively without reasoning steps.

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in LLMs caused by domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting during continual learning.

Method: Deploy KILO, a system integrating dynamic knowledge graphs and instruction tuning, which incorporates domain-specific knowledge guidance during training.

Result: KILO surpasses baseline models in backward and forward transfer, F1 score, knowledge retention, and training efficiency across diverse target domains.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting prove effective in tackling domain shift challenges in continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Double-Bench, a multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework designed to address weaknesses in current benchmarks for document RAG systems. It emphasizes more accurate and comprehensive evaluation using high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in current document RAG evaluation benchmarks, which rely on synthetic data and often fail to capture real-world challenges, thus impeding progress in system development.

Method: The authors created Double-Bench, a benchmark featuring multilingual and multimodal evaluation with 3,276 documents and 5,168 queries verified by human experts. It includes exhaustive ground-truth data, query evidence verification, and supports dynamic updates to prevent data contamination.

Result: Experiments with 9 embedding models, 4 MLLMs, and 4 document RAG frameworks reveal the shrinking gap between text and visual embedding models. It also highlights an overconfidence issue in current RAG systems, which provide unsupported answers.

Conclusion: Double-Bench establishes itself as a robust and open-source benchmark for evaluating advanced document RAG systems. Its comprehensive approach ensures high-quality evaluations, supporting future research and development in this domain.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LVLMs for multimodal sarcasm detection and explanation, proposing a framework to address visual and conceptual knowledge limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance the capabilities of LVLMs in interpreting and explaining sarcasm in multimodal contexts.

Method: The authors propose a training-free framework that integrates object extraction and external conceptual knowledge to improve sarcasm understanding by LVLMs.

Result: Experimental results on multiple models show improved performance of the proposed framework in multimodal sarcasm tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of LVLMs in understanding sarcasm by leveraging external knowledge and object-based insights.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is

*Zixuan Li,Binzong Geng,Jing Xiong,Yong He,Yuxuan Hu,Jian Chen,Dingwei Chen,Xiyu Chang,Liang Zhang,Linjian Mo,Chengming Li,Chuan Yuan,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new framework, CTR-Sink, which improves Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction in recommendation systems by addressing semantic fragmentation in user behavior sequences modeled by Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language Models are promising for CTR prediction in recommendation systems due to their strong semantic and contextual modeling. However, user behavior sequences differ structurally from natural language, causing LM inefficiencies.

Method: CTR-Sink introduces behavior-level attention sinks to improve LM focus on meaningful user behavior connections, leveraging signals like temporal distance. It uses a two-stage training and attention sink mechanism.

Result: Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source datasets demonstrate that CTR-Sink improves prediction performance and captures behavioral correlations better than existing methods.

Conclusion: CTR-Sink effectively addresses structural gaps between user behavior data and natural language, providing significant improvements in CTR prediction and recommendation systems.

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the

*Shudong Liu,Hongwei Liu,Junnan Liu,Linchen Xiao,Songyang Gao,Chengqi Lyu,Yuzhe Gu,Wenwei Zhang,Derek F. Wong,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompassVerifier, a lightweight and robust model designed to verify answers from LLMs across multiple domains, addressing challenges like limited benchmarks and lack of verifier robustness. It also presents VerifierBench, a benchmark for systematic verification assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address two limitations in current answer verification methodologies: inadequate systematic benchmarks for evaluating LLM verification capabilities, and the lack of robust and generalizable verifier models to handle edge cases and multiple domains.

Method: The authors developed CompassVerifier, a lightweight verifier model capable of evaluating responses across diverse tasks and domains. They also created VerifierBench, a benchmark based on model outputs and manual meta-error pattern analysis.

Result: CompassVerifier demonstrates domain-agnostic competency in math, knowledge, and reasoning tasks, identifying invalid or abnormal responses effectively. VerifierBench enriches the verification process by providing systematic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CompassVerifier and VerifierBench advance answer verification, aiding in evaluation protocols and reinforcement learning research. Their robustness and comprehensiveness promise better optimization guidance for LLMs.

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI systems in educational settings while promoting trustworthiness through explainable AI (XAI).

Method: Participants in the XAI Challenge 2025 were tasked with building QA systems that provide logic-based explanations using lightweight LLMs or hybrid systems. They were provided with a refined dataset validated for real-world academic scenarios.

Result: The paper presents actionable insights into the integration of LLMs and symbolic reasoning for explainable AI, highlighting successful approaches in the hackathon and offering guidance for future research.

Conclusion: The XAI Challenge 2025 serves as a bridge between LLMs and symbolic reasoning to foster explainability and trustworthiness in educational AI systems, offering a valuable framework for future educational AI endeavors.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT introduces a two-stage framework for video virtual try-on (VVT) using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to enhance garment detail preservation and temporal coherence in real-world scenarios while leveraging unpaired datasets and pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in video virtual try-on technology, particularly the inability of existing methods to preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal consistency in real-world scenarios due to reliance on scarce paired datasets.

Method: The proposed solution, DreamVVT, utilizes a two-stage framework: Stage 1 synthesizes keyframe try-on images using a multi-frame model integrated with a vision-language model. Stage 2 uses these keyframes as guidance for video generation, incorporating skeleton maps and pretrained models enhanced with LoRA adapters.

Result: DreamVVT outperforms existing methods in preserving detailed garment content and maintaining long-term temporal stability, as supported by extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: DreamVVT successfully improves adaptability in real-world video virtual try-on scenarios and achieves superior performance in garment detail preservation and temporal coherence compared to existing frameworks.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-power, real-time hand gesture recognition system using neuromorphic radar and event-driven architecture with >85% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient, low-power, real-time hand gesture recognition system by leveraging neuromorphic approaches.

Method: Developed a radar system using 24 GHz Doppler radar and a custom neuromorphic sampler for sparse spike-based representations, processed by a lightweight neural network.

Result: Achieved over 85% accuracy on a dataset of five hand gestures from seven users while reducing power and computation needs.

Conclusion: The proposed system is novel in its use of bio-inspired encoding and event-driven radar processing, showcasing its potential for efficient gesture recognition.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

### [109] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of layer normalization (LN) in the image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA) due to its disruption of natural energy hierarchies among visual tokens. It proposes replacing LN with DynTanh activation to better preserve token energies, leading to improved performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer normalization in IJEPA disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, which reduces the model's ability to prioritize semantically important regions and leads to artifacts in loss maps.

Method: The authors replace feature layer normalization (LN) with DynTanh activation to better preserve token energies and allow high-energy visual tokens to contribute more effectively to prediction loss.

Result: Using DynTanh activation instead of LN, the IJEPA model achieved improved performance metrics: ImageNet linear probe accuracy rose from 38% to 42.7% for ViT-Small, and RMSE was reduced by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: Preserving natural token energies is crucial for self-supervised visual representation learning, and the proposed DynTanh activation offers a simple yet effective solution by restoring important semantic priorities in visual analysis.

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [110] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE introduces a hybrid model combining Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for photorealistic rendering with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for real-time interactive editing and intuitive scene manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF have high rendering quality but are difficult to edit, while GS offers interactive editing and faster performance but lacks NeRF's fidelity.

Method: GENIE employs Gaussian primitives with trainable feature embeddings, introduces Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS) for efficient nearest neighbor search, and uses a multi-resolution hash grid for feature updates.

Result: Real-time, locality-aware editing is achieved, enabling dynamic interaction and compatibility with physical simulation, blending the benefits of implicit and explicit scene representations.

Conclusion: GENIE bridges the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering, supporting intuitive manipulation and dynamic interaction for high fidelity and interactive 3D scenes.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework for medical images using noisy, coarse-level annotations to approximate pixel-accurate labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotations for medical image segmentation are expensive and require expertise. The paper seeks to develop a method that uses widely available but noisy, coarse annotations to achieve accurate segmentation.

Method: The method introduces transition matrices to model inaccuracies in coarse annotations and uses joint training on multiple annotation sets to refine outputs progressively, approximating accurate segmentation labels.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and neared the performance of fully supervised approaches on ACDC, MSCMRseg, and UK Biobank datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective for leveraging coarse annotations, offering a viable alternative when fully annotated data is unavailable, and is robust for broader application in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [112] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIDAR, a model to approximate realistic LiDAR detections for autonomous vehicle simulations efficiently, especially in scaling scenarios where traditional game-engine-based simulators struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game-engine-based simulators, though precise in sensor data modeling, face scalability issues in realistic detection outputs for multi-AV scenarios, while microscopic simulators like SUMO lack the ability to model perception realistically. The paper aims to bridge these challenges.

Method: MIDAR uses a Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph to model occlusion among vehicles and employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to predict LiDAR detection results like true positives and false negatives based on vehicle spatial layouts.

Result: MIDAR achieves an impressive AUC of 0.909 aligning closely with detection results from a mainstream model (CenterPoint) on the nuScenes AD dataset and proves critical in accurate CP-based traffic applications.

Conclusion: MIDAR can be integrated seamlessly with traffic simulators and datasets, enabling scalable, realistic perception modeling critical for autonomous driving applications, and will be open-sourced for further adoption and development.

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how transformer-based neural networks perform compared to convolutional networks for object detection tasks in high-resolution satellite imagery, an area yet to see large-scale benchmarking.

Method: Thirty-three deep learning models, encompassing 11 distinct architectures (5 transformer-based and 6 convolutional) trained and evaluated on three open-source high-resolution satellite imagery datasets.

Result: Transformer-based networks demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in object detection and localization within the evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Transformers are highly effective for satellite imagery-based object detection tasks, marking a significant advancement in visual tasks within this domain.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

TL;DR: VisuCraft is a framework that enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in generating creative and visually grounded long-form texts by using a multimodal information extractor and dynamic prompt generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of LVLMs in generating long-form text with high visual fidelity, creativity, and adherence to detailed user instructions.

Method: VisuCraft integrates a multimodal structured information extractor to analyze visual data and a dynamic prompt generation module to combine extracted attributes with user instructions. These optimized prompts are fed into LVLMs like LLaVA for improved text generation.

Result: Using a custom ImageStoryGen-500K dataset and VisuGen Metrics, VisuCraft significantly outperformed baseline models in tasks like story and poetry generation, particularly excelling in creativity and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: VisuCraft demonstrates enhanced capabilities in creative text generation, unlocking advanced applications for LVLMs in visually-guided and user-aligned creative content generation.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces robust denoising diffusion models to address unsupervised anomaly segmentation using contaminated data and achieves improvements in AUROC and AUPRC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing diffusion models requiring access to pure normal data for training and to enable anomaly segmentation using contaminated datasets.

Method: Transforms the denoising diffusion probabilistic model into a nonlinear regression problem, leveraging robust regression techniques.

Result: The proposed methodology significantly outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in unsupervised anomaly segmentation tasks, with notable gains in AUROC and AUPRC metrics on MVTec datasets.

Conclusion: Robust denoising diffusion models enable effective anomaly segmentation using contaminated data, making them highly applicable to realistic and challenging data scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To allow better simulation and control of indoor audio environments by generating room acoustics tailored to user-defined materials.

Method: A novel encoder-decoder model is used to process audio-visual scene data and user-provided material configurations to dynamically generate Room Impulse Responses (RIRs).

Result: The model outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in generating material-aware RIRs, supported by a new benchmark dataset called the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset.

Conclusion: The study shows the effectiveness of the approach in encoding material-specific information and producing diverse, high-quality RIRs for various material configurations.

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set. However, it underperforms compared to specialized navigation models.

Conclusion: While off-the-shelf LVLMs can adapt to Vision-and-Language Navigation tasks, their performance is still limited compared to models explicitly designed for navigation.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [118] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates limitations of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in blind deconvolution when paired with sparsity-based priors, and demonstrates how local minimizers in the posterior landscape can yield natural, realistic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MAP estimation, which struggles to produce sharp and realistic images due to its tendency to favor blurry solutions with sparsity-promoting priors.

Method: The authors examine the likelihood landscape of diffusion-based priors, perform a theoretical analysis of the blind deblurring posterior, and validate insights through numerical experiments.

Result: They find that blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods, while realistic images correspond to local minima in the posterior. MAP estimations often yield blurry solutions, but gradient descent can access these local minima for realistic results.

Conclusion: Overcoming limitations of MAP requires effective initialization to local minimizers in the posterior landscape. Findings suggest better design of priors and optimization techniques for blind deconvolution problems.

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

### [119] [Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927)
*Srikanth Muralidharan,Heitor R. Medeiros,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the role of ImageNet pre-training for ultra-small models (sub-1M parameters) on downstream object detection tasks, with a focus on robustness in infrared visual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications necessitate recognition models that are both robust across varying operational conditions/modalities and suitable for edge devices with limited hardware. Understanding the effect of pre-training on extremely small models is essential.

Method: The authors leverage scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures to construct two ultra-small backbone families. They systematically assess model performance across three datasets to evaluate the impact of ImageNet pre-training on robustness.

Result: ImageNet pre-training remains useful for enhancing model robustness. However, its benefits diminish when models are scaled down below a certain capacity threshold, particularly for out-of-distribution conditions.

Conclusion: Practitioners should still use pre-training as a general rule. However, ultra-small models, while effective for in-domain tasks, are less reliable under varying operational conditions.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

### [120] [X-Actor: Emotional and Expressive Long-Range Portrait Acting from Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02944)
*Chenxu Zhang,Zenan Li,Hongyi Xu,You Xie,Xiaochen Zhao,Tianpei Gu,Guoxian Song,Xin Chen,Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Actor is a framework for creating emotionally expressive talking head videos from audio and a single image, leveraging novel diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in portrait animation often fall short in generating long-form videos with nuanced and evolving emotions tied to speech content.

Method: A decoupled two-stage pipeline using an autoregressive diffusion model for facial motion prediction and a video synthesis module for high-fidelity animations.

Result: X-Actor generates lifelike, emotionally rich, and cinematic-style talking heads with state-of-the-art performance in long-range emotional portrait animation.

Conclusion: X-Actor advances the creation of talking head animations by enabling infinite-length, compelling videos with nuanced emotional expressions driven by audio.

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [121] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies scale equivariance as a solution to enhance robustness in image denoising under spatially variant noise and proposes a model using HNM and IGM modules to address this challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising models struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution noises, particularly spatially varying noise, which is an underexplored problem.

Method: The proposed framework integrates scale-equivariant structures with two core modules: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) to stabilize and correct features under varying noise, and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM) to modulate information via gated interactions between signal and feature paths.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, particularly under conditions with spatially heterogeneous noise.

Conclusion: Incorporating scale-equivariant structures and specialized modules like HNM and IGM can significantly enhance robustness in blind image denoising tasks.

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

### [122] [Diffusion Models with Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02973)
*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ANSWER, a method to improve image generation in Diffusion Models (DMs) using adaptive negative sampling without explicit negative prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often struggle with prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting can address this but is currently lossy and incomplete.

Method: Proposed the ANSWER technique, leveraging internal negation understanding of DMs to account for both positive and negative conditions without additional training or external resources.

Result: ANSWER improves the performance of DMs on multiple benchmarks and doubles human preference over other methods.

Conclusion: ANSWER is a training-free and effective technique for better prompt compliance and image generation in DMs, compatible with any model supporting classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

### [123] [Separating Shared and Domain-Specific LoRAs for Multi-Domain Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02978)
*Yusaku Takama,Ning Ding,Tatsuya Yokota,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to separate shared and domain-specific LoRAs into distinct subspaces to assess their domain-specific information capturing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty exists about whether current multi-domain learning architectures, with shared and domain-specific LoRAs, effectively capture domain-specific information.

Method: The proposed method ensures shared and domain-specific LoRAs occupy different subspaces—column and left null subspaces of pre-trained weights—applied to action recognition datasets.

Result: The method demonstrated effectiveness in certain cases, supported by an analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Conclusion: Separating domain-specific LoRAs into distinct subspaces can effectively capture domain-specific information in multi-domain learning.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

TL;DR: The paper explores MoExDA, a domain adaptation technique leveraging RGB and edge frames to counteract static bias in action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern action recognition models face challenges due to static bias, which hampers their generalization performance.

Method: The method involves a lightweight domain adaptation using both RGB and edge frames to suppress static bias.

Result: Experimental results indicate that MoExDA leads to more robust action recognition with lower computational costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MoExDA successfully mitigates static bias, enhancing both performance and efficiency in action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced
generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight
domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

*Zachary Yahn,Selim Furkan Tekin,Fatih Ilhan,Sihao Hu,Tiansheng Huang,Yichang Xu,Margaret Loper,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFOG introduces an adversarial attack method focused on object detection transformers, efficiently exploiting vulnerabilities with minimal visual disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing adversarial attack methods targeting object detection, particularly against transformer-based detectors.

Method: AFOG employs a neural-architecture agnostic approach using learnable attention mechanisms and iterative adversarial perturbations to focus on vulnerable regions in images.

Result: AFOG achieves up to an 83% improvement over existing adversarial attacks in accuracy and imperceptibility across twelve transformer models on the COCO dataset.

Conclusion: AFOG demonstrates superior efficacy, stealth, and broader applicability, significantly outperforming prior methods and offering a robust attack framework for object detection models.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

### [126] [Seeing It Before It Happens: In-Generation NSFW Detection for Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03006)
*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative method, In-Generation Detection (IGD), for detecting NSFW content during the image generation phase in diffusion-based T2I models. This method uses predicted noise signals and achieves high accuracy in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of diffusion-based T2I models in generating NSFW content has led to concerns, especially since existing detection methods focus on pre-generation or post-generation phases. Exploring NSFW detection during the generation process could offer a new layer of moderation.

Method: The authors introduce IGD, which leverages the predicted noise from the diffusion process as a semantic signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is tested against adversarial and regular NSFW prompts.

Result: IGD demonstrated an average detection accuracy of 91.32% in identifying NSFW content across seven categories, surpassing seven established baseline methods.

Conclusion: IGD proves to be a viable and efficient strategy for moderating NSFW content in the generation phase of T2I diffusion models, suggesting a promising direction for internal moderation mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [127] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC) framework for domain generalization in semantic segmentation by aligning Vision Foundation Model features hierarchically, improving performance across unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of generalization in semantic segmentation models for domain generalization tasks, particularly focusing on the limitations of prior approaches that do not fully exploit hierarchical feature adaptation for dense predictions.

Method: The proposed MGFC framework employs a coarse-to-fine alignment strategy, starting with calibrating coarse-grained features for global context, moving to medium-grained features for category-level discriminability, and finally refining fine-grained features for spatial detail enhancement.

Result: Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGFC consistently achieves better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in the domain generalization semantic segmentation task.

Conclusion: The MGFC framework effectively enhances domain generalization by leveraging hierarchical and granularity-aware feature calibration techniques, marking an improvement in how VFMs are adapted for DGSS.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

*Xuyi Yang,Wenhao Zhang,Hongbo Jin,Lin Liu,Hongbo Xu,Yongwei Nie,Fei Yu,Fei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with long video understanding due to resource limitations. The authors propose SceneQA, a video question-answering framework focusing on scene-based detail perception and reasoning, supported by the LVSQA dataset. They introduce SLFG, a method that reassembles video frames into semantically coherent scene frames, enhancing model understanding without altering its architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models face difficulties in understanding long videos as they cannot process all frames effectively. Current approaches, which prioritize individual frame identification, fail to meet real-world requirements, highlighting the need for improved scene-based reasoning.

Method: The authors developed the SceneQA task and LVSQA dataset, emphasizing scene-level understanding. They proposed the SLFG method, which uses scene localization and dynamic frame reassembly to create coherent scene frames, bypassing the need to modify existing model architectures.

Result: SLFG demonstrated significant improvement in long video understanding during benchmark tests, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SceneQA framework and SLFG method enhance multimodal model capabilities in long video perception and reasoning, offering a practical and efficient approach with plug-and-play functionality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

*Liheng Zhang,Weihao Yu,Zubo Lu,Haozhi Gu,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-3DGS dramatically reduces storage costs for 3D Gaussian Splatting without compromising rendering quality, leveraging techniques like importance scoring, clustering, and codebook repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address high storage demands in 3D Gaussian Splatting due to the large number of Gaussian points required for scene representation, which hampers practical deployment and quality of compression.

Method: SA-3DGS introduces an importance score to identify insignificant Gaussian points, an importance-aware clustering module for accurate compression, and a codebook repair module for mitigating rendering quality loss.

Result: SA-3DGS achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or improving rendering quality, demonstrated on benchmark datasets. It also enhances other pruning-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SA-3DGS method enhances compression and rendering quality in 3D Gaussian Splatting, offering strong generalization ability and broad applicability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: The paper presents MoCA, a novel video generation model designed to address challenges in ID-preserving text-to-video synthesis, such as maintaining fine-grained facial dynamics and temporal identity coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video generation models fail at preserving fine-grained facial dynamics and maintaining temporal identity coherence across frames.

Method: The paper introduces MoCA, a Video Diffusion Model using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone and a novel Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism. It integrates Hierarchical Temporal Pooling for capturing identity features, Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts for dynamic spatiotemporal modeling, and a Latent Video Perceptual Loss for improving identity coherence and detail preservation.

Result: MoCA demonstrated superior performance on the CelebIPVid dataset, consisting of 10,000 videos from 1,000 individuals, surpassing existing methods by over 5% in Face similarity metrics.

Conclusion: MoCA effectively addresses limitations in existing T2V methods by achieving improved identity preservation and coherence, marking a significant advancement in diffusion-based video generation techniques.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges in cross-video question answering, particularly in establishing meaningful connections across video streams and multi-source information retrieval.

Method: The framework integrates person-level feature extraction through ReID and tracking algorithms, a hierarchical spanning tree to organize visual content, and a multi-agent reasoning system for cross-video queries.

Result: VideoForest achieves high accuracy in person recognition (71.93%), behavior analysis (83.75%), and summarization/reasoning (51.67%), surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: VideoForest establishes an innovative approach to cross-video reasoning via person-level unification, enabling efficient and sophisticated multi-source video analysis.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed

*Zeyu Zhu,Weijia Wu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIT, a dataset for generating realistic multi-human talking videos, and presents CovOG, a baseline model leveraging pose embeddings and audio features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on talking video generation are limited to single-person scenarios or isolated facial animations, restricting multi-human interaction applicability.

Method: The authors developed an automatic pipeline to collect and annotate a 12-hour dataset of multi-person conversational videos with fine-grained body poses and speech interactions. They also propose CovOG, a model using a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) and an Interactive Audio Driver (IAD).

Result: The dataset enables realistic multi-speaker dynamics, and CovOG demonstrates both feasibility and challenges in multi-human talking video generation.

Conclusion: MIT establishes itself as a significant resource for studying interactive behaviors, setting the foundation for future research in multi-human talking videos.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

### [133] [Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03055)
*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework focused on face matting for improved performance in occlusion scenarios while delivering high-quality alpha mattes without auxiliary inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face filters for short videos often fail in the presence of occlusions like hands or accessories. Addressing this issue, face matting is introduced to accurately distinguish facial regions from occluding elements.

Method: The method employs a two-stage training pipeline involving a teacher model predicting alpha mattes and uncertainties, followed by guiding a student model via spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. The matting objective is refined by treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background.

Result: FaceMat demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks, achieving enhanced visual quality and robustness in face filtering under complex occlusions.

Conclusion: FaceMat is a novel framework suitable for real-time applications, requiring no auxiliary inputs, and successfully improving face filter applications by leveraging a new dataset, CelebAMat, for training and evaluation.

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

### [134] [CHARM: Collaborative Harmonization across Arbitrary Modalities for Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03060)
*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CHARM, a framework for semantic segmentation that maintains the strengths of different modalities while aligning them, rather than homogenizing them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods reduce the individual strengths of modalities by focusing on feature alignment, which undermines cross-modal complementarity.

Method: The proposed CHARM framework uses two innovative components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU) for implicit alignment of features and (2) a dual-path optimization strategy that integrates collaborative fusion and individual modality optimization.

Result: The experiments consistently show that CHARM outperforms baseline methods, particularly improving performance on weaker modalities.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a shift from modality homogenization to harmonization, offering improved handling of diverse data for better segmentation performance.

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

*Trinh Quoc Nguyen,Oky Dicky Ardiansyah Prima,Katsuyoshi Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE-ReID is a new framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in person re-identification, combining advanced techniques for improved performance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-identification, particularly harmonizing diverse image characteristics from different camera sources and improving pseudo-labeling mechanisms.

Method: Using CycleGAN for data generation in pre-training and teacher-student networks for multi-view, multi-level clustering in fine-tuning, coupled with a learnable Ensemble Fusion component to enhance feature extraction and learning.

Result: Experiments on three common UDA benchmarks showed significant performance improvements in metrics like Mean Average Precision and Top-1 accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The CORE-ReID framework effectively tackles UDA challenges in person re-identification by ensuring clarity in feature fusion and achieving high accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, offering an advanced solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

### [136] [SSFMamba: Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency Feature Fusion for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03069)
*Bo Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wu Liu,Xiuzhuang Zhou,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of limited global context modeling in 3D medical image segmentation. It introduces SSFMamba, leveraging spatial and frequency domain fusion with a novel architecture and demonstrates superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial domain techniques face limitations in modeling global context for 3D medical image segmentation. Current frequency domain integration approaches fail to exploit unique frequency properties and their differences with the spatial domain, affecting performance.

Method: They propose SSFMamba, featuring a dual-branch architecture that separately processes spatial and frequency domain features. A Mamba block is used for fusing these features. A 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism strengthens local-global feature fusion, enhancing detail and context.

Result: Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets show that SSFMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics for 3D medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: SSFMamba effectively bridges the spatial and frequency domain information, enhancing global context modeling while preserving local details. The approach demonstrates robustness and improved performance for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

### [137] [RobustGS: Unified Boosting of Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting under Low-Quality Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03077)
*Anran Wu,Long Peng,Xin Di,Xueyuan Dai,Chen Wu,Yang Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RobustGS, a module to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting under adverse imaging conditions, improving the quality of reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of feedforward 3DGS methods, which fail under real-world imaging challenges like noise, low light, or environmental effects.

Method: The authors propose a multi-view feature enhancement module called RobustGS that incorporates a Generalized Degradation Learner to handle multiple types of input degradation and a semantic-aware state-space model for enhanced cross-view aggregation.

Result: The RobustGS approach significantly enhances 3D reconstruction quality across a range of imaging challenges when integrated with existing pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed RobustGS module substantially improves 3D reconstruction robustness in feedforward pipelines and maintains high performance under challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

*Zaiying Zhao,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the fairness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) beyond demographic attributes, revealing biases across diverse factors like cultural and environmental influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness of LVLMs has traditionally been studied concerning demographic factors like race and gender. This paper aims to identify biases in a more comprehensive set of attributes.

Method: The researchers constructed an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes using Large Language Models (LLMs) and analyzed the fairness of LVLMs across finer-grained attributes.

Result: Experimental findings show LVLMs generate biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes, with cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors impacting their decision-making more than demographic attributes.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need to account for a wider range of attributes when assessing fairness in LVLMs and emphasizes the significant influence of contextual factors like culture and environment.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

### [139] [Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03081)
*Bo Zhang,Xu Xinan,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to improve the diversity of pseudo-bags in MIL-based WSI classification and resolves challenges arising from increased critical instances with a novel contrastive learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-bag augmentation methods sample instances from a limited set of bags, leading to constrained diversity, hampering WSI classification performance.

Method: The paper proposes $C^2Aug$, which samples from all bags of the same class to increase pseudo-bag diversity and employs a contrastive learning framework to distinguish features with varying semantic meanings.

Result: Empirical results showed $C^2Aug$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation improves WSI classification's effectiveness by addressing diversity and semantic discrimination challenges, ensuring robust performance even on test slides with small tumor areas.

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Jiantao Tan,Peixian Ma,Kanghao Chen,Zhiming Dai,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for continual learning in medical image classification, using visual concepts generated by large language models to enhance semantic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to medical image classification in continual learning environments fail to leverage rich semantic information from textual modalities, relying instead on simplistic templates.

Method: The authors propose a framework that uses large language models to generate a dynamic visual concept pool with similarity-based filtering. A cross-modal image-concept attention module integrates semantic knowledge into the learning process, along with an attention loss.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments on both medical and natural image datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances continual learning by leveraging semantic guidance, and the code will be made publicly available to aid further research.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

*Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR introduces an advanced framework for multimodal reasoning in videos, addressing inefficiencies, vanishing advantages, and uniform credit assignment in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome key limitations in multimodal reasoning methods, such as inefficiencies, vanishing advantages, and poor credit assignment in complex video understanding tasks.

Method: AVATAR employs off-policy training for sample reuse and develops Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS) to improve credit assignment during reasoning.

Result: The framework outperformed existing benchmarks like MMVU (+5.4), OmniBench (+4.9), and Video-Holmes (+4.5), while exhibiting a 35% increase in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: AVATAR significantly enhances multimodal reasoning performance through innovative strategies, making it effective and sample-efficient.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

### [142] [Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03102)
*Tianjiao Jiang,Zhen Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Javen Qinfeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), which enhances few-shot learning through disentangled visual features and aligns them using CLIP's cross-modal capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current few-shot learning methods which struggle with entangled visual representations and overfitting due to limited labeled data.

Method: The authors propose CCA that utilizes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for disentangled representations, fine-tunes CLIP's text classifier, and employs cross-attention mechanisms to align and enrich visual and textual data.

Result: Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that CCA consistently delivers superior few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CCA effectively advances few-shot learning by reducing overfitting, leveraging disentangled representations, and aligning modalities, offering a robust and efficient framework for adaptation.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

*Heng Jia,Linchao Zhu,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes H3R, a hybrid framework for generalizable 3D reconstruction that combines volumetric latent fusion and attention-based feature aggregation to improve geometric consistency and correspondence refinement. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence and higher PSNR on prominent benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the trade-off in multi-view 3D reconstruction between geometric precision (explicit methods) and robustness (implicit methods), which hampers generalization and efficiency.

Method: The researchers introduce H3R, combining two key components: (1) an efficient latent volume using epipolar constraints for geometric consistency, and (2) a camera-aware Transformer utilizing Plücker coordinates for adaptive refinement of multi-view correspondences.

Result: H3R achieves superior performance, including 2× faster convergence and significant PSNR improvements on RealEstate10K (+0.59 dB), ACID (+1.06 dB), and DTU (+0.22 dB) benchmarks, while also demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: By integrating explicit and implicit methods, H3R enhances geometric precision and robustness, supporting flexible high-resolution inputs. The framework resolves key semantic mismatch issues and sets a new standard in generalizable 3D reconstruction applications.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

### [144] [Landsat30-AU: A Vision-Language Dataset for Australian Landsat Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03127)
*Sai Ma,Zhuang Li,John A Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Landsat30-AU, a vision-language dataset from low-resolution Landsat satellite imagery, emphasizing its role in bridging gaps in remote-sensing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for satellite imagery are limited to high-resolution, short-term data and fail to utilize long-term, multi-satellite archives like Landsat, crucial for unbiased global environmental monitoring.

Method: The paper curates the Landsat30-AU dataset using data from four Landsat satellites over 36 years, including image-caption pairs and VQA samples. It uses a bootstrapped pipeline, generic VLMs, iterative refinement, and human verification.

Result: Evaluating eight VLMs on the dataset revealed weak performance, with a notable improvement achieved through fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B, boosting captioning SPIDEr scores from 0.11 to 0.31 and VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

Conclusion: The study highlights the underperformance of current VLMs for satellite remote sensing tasks and demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning on specialized datasets like Landsat30-AU to address these limitations.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COFFEE, a framework for real-time pose estimation of rotating celestial objects like asteroids, overcoming biases caused by self-cast shadows and achieving faster, more accurate results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods struggle with accuracy, computational demands, and robustness against self-cast shadows on celestial objects, which can bias estimates and risk mission failures during chaotic tumbling motion.

Method: COFFEE leverages sun phase angle data to associate salient contours with shadows and uses a Sparse Neural Network and an attention-based Graph Neural Network to match features between frames.

Result: The COFFEE pipeline achieves bias-free pose estimation, higher accuracy compared to traditional methods, and is significantly faster than state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic and simulated asteroid data.

Conclusion: COFFEE offers a robust, real-time solution for pose estimation of celestial objects, addressing challenges posed by shadows and computational constraints, with strong potential for mission-critical space applications.

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of annotated fire scene datasets for building units, which limits the development of robust computer vision models for fire detections in early warning systems and rescue operations.

Method: The authors leverage drones to capture real multi-story building scenes, combine synthetic enhancements like motion blur, brightness adjustment, and fire effect generation using large models, and create 1,978 realistic images to simulate diverse fire scenarios.

Result: The generated dataset provides multi-scenario data for fire detection, enhancing model generalization ability while minimizing risks and costs related to collecting real fire data.

Conclusion: This dataset offers a robust tool for improving fire unit detection systems, enabling scalable and cost-efficient training for various scenarios.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

### [147] [UniEdit-I: Training-free Image Editing for Unified VLM via Iterative Understanding, Editing and Verifying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03142)
*Chengyu Bai,Jintao Chen,Xiang Bai,Yilong Chen,Qi She,Ming Lu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework, UniEdit-I, to enhance unified vision-language models (VLMs) with image editing capabilities through an iterative understanding-editing-verifying process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models excel in visual understanding and generation, yet enabling image editing capabilities within these frameworks remains unexplored.

Method: A three-step iterative process: (1) understanding the source image and creating prompts, (2) using time-adaptive offsets for coherent editing during the denoising process, and (3) verifying prompt alignment with iterative corrective feedback.

Result: The implementation of UniEdit-I based on BLIP3-o shows state-of-the-art results on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: UniEdit-I introduces an innovative, training-free approach for achieving high-fidelity image editing in unified vision-language models.

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

*Yanshu Wang,Xichen Xu,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method called SARD enhances industrial anomaly detection by synthesizing realistic anomalies with better spatial control and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for synthesizing anomalies struggle with spatial controllability and preserving regional fidelity.

Method: SARD introduces Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) and Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) to selectively update anomaly regions and evaluate realism using pixel-level masks.

Result: SARD outperforms existing methods in both segmentation accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: SARD establishes a new standard for pixel-level anomaly synthesis, improving industrial anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

*Liangyang Ouyang,Jiafeng Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LORE, a training-free image editing method that addresses semantic bias issues in existing models, enhancing image editing quality and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome semantic alignment flaws in current text-driven image editing methods that lead to editing failures or unintended modifications.

Method: The method introduced, LORE, directly optimizes inverted noise, bypassing architectural changes or model fine-tuning for generalized and controllable image editing.

Result: LORE achieves superior semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity compared to existing methods, as validated on challenging benchmarks PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit.

Conclusion: Latent-space optimization addressed core limitations in existing techniques, highlighting LORE’s scalability and effectiveness for versatile image editing tasks.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

TL;DR: The LRDDv2 dataset consists of 39,516 annotated images aimed at improving long-range drone detection under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of UAVs necessitates effective detection systems to ensure safety, particularly in populated areas, which remains challenging due to limitations in existing solutions.

Method: A new dataset, LRDDv2, was developed with diverse annotations, including range information for 8,000+ images, focusing on long-range drone detection.

Result: A comprehensive dataset (LRDDv2) offers images of drones primarily with fewer than 50 pixels and includes unique range estimation details.

Conclusion: LRDDv2 provides researchers with a robust resource for developing advanced algorithms for long-range detection and range estimation of drones.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

### [151] [ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03164)
*Junyoung Lim,Jaewoo Ahn,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartCap introduces a large dataset and validation methods for improving chart captions, emphasizing caption accuracy and visual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for chart captioning suffer limitations, such as extraneous information and insufficient structural insight coverage.

Method: The authors develop a four-stage caption generation pipeline with human verification and propose a novel metric called Visual Consistency Score.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ChartCap generate high-quality captions with fewer hallucinations, outperforming existing models and human annotations.

Conclusion: ChartCap improves chart captioning quality, laying groundwork for better caption generation with reduced reliance on references.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

*Katherine Liu,Sergey Zakharov,Dian Chen,Takuya Ikeda,Greg Shakhnarovich,Adrien Gaidon,Rares Ambrus*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniShape is a novel framework for probabilistic pose and full shape estimation of objects from a single observation without relying on known 3D models or categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method that enables estimating both the pose and shape of objects from single observations in scenarios where no prior knowledge of the 3D model or object category is available.

Method: The method relies on decoupling shape completion into two multi-modal distributions: one for projecting measurements into a normalized object reference frame and another for modeling object geometries via triplanar neural fields. Conditional diffusion models are trained separately for these distributions to sample from the joint pose and shape distribution.

Result: OmniShape achieves impressive performance on challenging real-world datasets, successfully enabling multi-hypothesis sampling for pose and shape estimation.

Conclusion: OmniShape is the first probabilistic framework that separates shape completion into two distributions, offering a powerful solution for pose and full shape estimation without prior 3D model knowledge.

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylized images induce more hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). This paper introduces the SAVER mechanism to mitigate hallucination by leveraging early-layer visual attention patterns, demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stylized images, unlike photographic images, pose unique challenges for LVLMs due to their frequent hallucinations in tasks like game scene understanding, art education, and medical analysis.

Method: A new dataset containing both photographic images and stylized versions with annotated captions was constructed. LVLMs were benchmarked for hallucination effects, and the SAVER mechanism was developed to adjust visual attention dynamically.

Result: Stylized images induce significantly more hallucinations than photographic ones. SAVER successfully mitigates these hallucinations and outperforms existing methods in various setups.

Conclusion: SAVER is a significant step forward in addressing hallucination issues caused by stylized images in LVLMs. It enhances model robustness and broadens their applicability to critical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in generating panoramic LiDAR data guided by monocular RGB images and proposes Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance scalable and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation for autonomous systems, solving issues in existing methods that lack fine spatial control or alignment between RGB and LiDAR modalities.

Method: The proposed method, Veila, integrates Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM), Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA), and Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) to improve spatial control, alignment, and structural consistency of RGB-LiDAR data.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that Veila achieves high generation fidelity and alignment, while also improving downstream tasks like LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Veila represents a significant advancement in RGB-conditioned panoramic LiDAR synthesis, providing superior generation quality and cross-modal consistency with potential applications in autonomous driving and robotics.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LiDAR generation models lack explicit control over object placement and spatial consistency, limiting their applications in simulation and validation tasks.

Method: The method combines semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion and relation-aware contextual conditioning, followed by foreground-aware control injection.

Result: The proposed model, La La LiDAR, achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllable LiDAR generation and related perception tasks.

Conclusion: La La LiDAR sets a new benchmark for 3D scene generation, offering customizable tools for scenario simulation in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: Duplex-GS integrates proxy Gaussian representations and order-independent rendering to efficiently improve 3D Gaussian Splatting performance while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods sacrifice efficiency for rendering fidelity due to reliance on costly computations like sequential alpha-blending.

Method: The Duplex-GS framework uses a dual-hierarchy system combining proxy Gaussian representations, cell proxies, cell search rasterization, and weighted sum rendering techniques with Order-Independent Transparency.

Result: Duplex-GS demonstrates significant efficiency gains in real-world tests, achieving up to 4x speed improvements and significant reductions (52.2%-86.9%) in radix sort overhead without compromising rendering quality.

Conclusion: This paper shows that integrating OIT with enhanced Gaussian Splatting methods achieves both high-quality results and real-time rendering efficiency, making it highly applicable for large-scale and resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for autonomous driving largely focus on videos or occupancy grids, neglecting LiDAR's potential. This work aims to address challenges in controllability, coherence, and standardized evaluation for LiDAR models.

Method: LiDARCrafter converts natural language inputs into scene graphs to condition a tri-branch diffusion network for generating object structures and motion, along with an autoregressive module for smooth transitions.

Result: LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across various metrics on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter enhances LiDAR-based data generation and editing, offering better tools for simulation and data augmentation in autonomous driving communities.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for monocular depth estimation by combining local and global cues using novel modules GLKAM and GBPM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation faces challenges due to ambiguity caused by recovering 3D structures from single-view images.

Method: The proposed approach uses GLKAM to capture local structural information and GBPM to enhance global depth perception.

Result: Experiments on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the proposed modules.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves monocular depth estimation, addressing its inherent challenges with novel structural modules.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to address catastrophic forgetting in continual face forgery detection using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of face forgery techniques poses challenges for detectors to adapt without losing performance on older forgery methods.

Method: The authors propose the KAN-CFD framework, incorporating DG-KD for adapting KANs to high-dimensional images and FS-KDCP to prevent overlap in KAN input spaces without prior task data.

Result: Experiments validate that KAN-CFD achieves superior detection performance and drastically mitigates forgetting of previously learned forgery types.

Conclusion: KAN-CFD is an effective solution for continual face forgery detection, demonstrating resilience against catastrophic forgetting while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first publicly accessible dataset for CNV and proposes MTG-Net, a network for CNV segmentation in OCTA images that accounts for region and vessel features, optimizing accuracy and mitigating imaging challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve clinical assessment of wet AMD by addressing segmentation challenges in OCTA images caused by irregular CNV shapes and imaging artifacts.

Method: The study constructs a CNV dataset and develops MTG-Net, which combines a multi-task framework with graph-based modules to enhance segmentation by exploring semantic and geometric constraints and using uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: MTG-Net achieved high accuracy in CNV segmentation with Dice scores of 87.21% for region segmentation and 88.12% for vessel segmentation, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MTG-Net effectively tackles CNV segmentation issues in OCTA images, offering improved accuracy and reliability for clinical assessments.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

*Yidan Wang,Chenyi Zhuang,Wutao Liu,Pan Gao,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents AlignCAT, a framework to improve object localization in images using text descriptions under weak supervision, addressing limitations in existing methods caused by semantic ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for weakly supervised visual grounding struggle to handle subtle semantic distinctions and ambiguities in text-based references due to lack of strong cross-modal reasoning.

Method: AlignCAT incorporates a coarse-grained alignment module using category and global context information and a fine-grained alignment module that captures detailed word-level text features to ensure semantic alignment.

Result: AlignCAT shows superior performance compared to existing methods on three visual grounding benchmarks: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg.

Conclusion: The proposed AlignCAT effectively improves semantic matching and visual query filtering, advancing weakly supervised visual grounding through better cross-modal reasoning and alignment.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

### [163] [Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection with Interaction-aware Prompt and Concept Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03207)
*Ting Lei,Shaofeng Yin,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC is a model designed for detecting human-object interactions and generalizing across unseen classes. It surpasses current methods by addressing shortcomings in image-level pre-training and text encoding, utilizing interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction detection, addressing limitations in current models such as inadequate image-level pre-training and difficulties in encoding textual descriptions, which hinder capturing detailed HOI relationships.

Method: The method involves introducing an interaction-aware prompt generator to focus on scene-specific interaction patterns instead of broad image semantics. Additionally, concept calibration via language model guidance and a negative sampling strategy enhances differentiation of interaction concepts.

Result: INP-CC achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets, demonstrating superior capabilities compared to existing models in detecting HOI and generalizing to novel classes.

Conclusion: By addressing critical challenges like region-level interaction detection and semantic differentiation, INP-CC enhances the effectiveness and robustness of open-vocabulary HOI detection, showcasing significant advancements over prior methods.

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastInit to improve video generation efficiency and temporal consistency by eliminating iterative noise refinement during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency and temporal consistency issues in video generation using diffusion models.

Method: Developed FastInit with a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) for refined noise generation in a single forward pass using text prompts and noise input.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved video quality and temporal consistency across multiple text-to-video models.

Conclusion: FastInit enhances efficiency and consistency in video generation, with practical inference applicability and planned public code/data release.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

*Xinwei Liu,Xiaojun Jia,Yuan Xun,Simeng Qin,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield is a framework designed to protect geoprivacy by defending against geolocation inference from images shared publicly, using advanced Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the significant risk posed by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that infer users' location from shared images and aims to overcome limitations in current adversarial defense methods.

Method: GeoShield consists of three modules: feature disentanglement, exposure element identification for pinpointing geo-revealing regions, and scale-adaptive enhancement to optimize perturbations globally and locally.

Result: GeoShield outperformed existing approaches in experiments, offering robust privacy protection while maintaining the visual and semantic quality of images.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the exploration of adversarial defenses against VLM-generated geolocation inference, providing a groundbreaking and effective geoprivacy solution.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

*Wang Yu-Hang,Shiwei Li,Jianxiang Liao,Li Bohan,Jian Liu,Wenfei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA), an efficient method for adversarial defense by leveraging pre-computed universal perturbations offline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial perturbations threaten deep learning models, and existing defense strategies like Adversarial Training face drawbacks such as high computational demands and performance degradation. Efficient, robust defense mechanisms are urgently needed.

Method: The UAA framework works by pre-computing universal transformations offline to avoid expensive online adversarial example generation. It combines diverse augmentation strategies to apply unique perturbations efficiently during training.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that UAA achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness for data-augmentation-based adversarial defenses without requiring online perturbation generation.

Conclusion: UAA is a practical and efficient solution for adversarial defense, making robust model training both computationally viable and impactful.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ActionSink, a framework for enhancing precision in robot manipulation actions by leveraging self-supervised action-caused optical flows ('action flow').


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing precise low-level action estimations, a key limiting factor in learning-based robot manipulation, despite advancements in high-level perception and planning.

Method: ActionSink reformulates actions as self-supervised 'action flows' derived from optical flows in videos. It includes: a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher for iterative refinement and a dynamic action flow integrator with a working memory and multi-layer fusion module for accurate action estimation.

Result: ActionSink showed a 7.9% success rate improvement on the LIBERO benchmark and gained nearly 8% accuracy on the long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long, outperforming prior SOTA.

Conclusion: ActionSink provides an accurate and innovative approach for enhancing robot manipulation by addressing low-level action estimation challenges.

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method, Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), to improve 3D segmentation by addressing inconsistencies in 2D segmentation using a novel weight matrix and adaptive density control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the challenge of achieving consistent and accurate 3D visual segmentation starting from noisy and inconsistent 2D segmentation masks.

Method: The proposed method, GIT, enhances the Gaussian representation by incorporating an instance weight matrix to correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. It also introduces an adaptive density control mechanism to refine Gaussians during training, improving boundary clarity.

Result: The method delivers cleaner 3D assets and improves segmentation accuracy in both online (e.g., self-prompting) and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) scenarios.

Conclusion: GIT enables more detailed and coherent segmentation across applications like hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing, overcoming prior limitations in 3D segmentation workflows.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Result: The proposed method achieved high-precision shape classification, performed better than fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high, and proved robust against small datasets, morphological variations, and domain shifts.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the efficacy of vision foundation models like SAM and DINOv2 as efficient, accessible alternatives to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle research.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive

combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle

TL;DR: This study introduces FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic dataset containing paired bare and makeup facial images for beauty-related tasks. It emphasizes preserving facial identity and consistency while offering realism through improved makeup transfer methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of obtaining high-quality paired bare and makeup facial images, which are rarely available due to difficulties in real-world data collection and limitations of existing synthetic methods that compromise realism and consistency.

Method: This research uses the FFHQ dataset as a foundation and employs an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. It generates 90K paired bare-makeup images with 18K identities, each paired with five distinct makeup styles.

Result: The FFHQ-Makeup dataset is created, offering a collection of 90K high-quality, identity-preserving paired images that fulfill the need for realism and consistency in paired facial data for beauty-focused applications.

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup bridges the gap in high-quality paired bare-makeup datasets, providing a crucial resource for advancing beauty-related research tasks, such as virtual try-on and facial aesthetics analysis.

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP is a transformer-based approach for multi-view rigid object pose estimation that outperforms existing methods, particularly in cases of pose ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-view and existing multi-view methods face limitations in resolving rigid object pose ambiguities when using only visual data.

Method: MVTOP uses early fusion of view-specific features and leverages multi-view geometry via lines of sight from camera centers to predict rigid object poses without requiring depth information.

Result: MVTOP outperforms other single-view and multi-view methods on a synthetic dataset designed to highlight pose ambiguities, as well as achieving competitive results on the YCB-V dataset.

Conclusion: MVTOP offers a reliable, end-to-end trainable solution for holistic multi-view pose estimation, overcoming limitations in existing approaches and adapting flexibly to varying camera setups.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Motivation: To address the challenge of limited spatial resolution in event cameras for fine-grained perception tasks.

Method: The method involves a stream-based event-to-event super-resolution approach using SNNs, along with a novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy and Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss).

Result: The approach achieves competitive super-resolution performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing both model size and inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices and use as a preprocessing module for downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of multi-step inference in existing 3D object detection methods using DDPMs while achieving robust and reliable detection under perturbations.

Method: RSDNet learns through latent space denoising using multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs), reformulated noising-denoising mechanisms, and semantic-geometric conditional guidance to enhance robustness and precision. It also implements a detachable design for single-step inference.

Result: RSDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection on public benchmarks, surpassing existing methods in robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RSDNet improves both robustness to perturbations and inference efficiency in 3D object detection, marking a significant advancement with its innovative single-stage sparse detection pipeline and detachable latent framework.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

TL;DR: ReDPO is a new distillation method that combines DPO and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to improve efficiency and effectiveness of text-to-video models, accompanied by a data filtering framework V.I.P., achieving reduced parameters while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational cost of text-to-video models and their quality degradation after applying existing pruning and distillation methods.

Method: Developed ReDPO that integrates DPO and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), alongside introducing V.I.P. for dataset curation and step-by-step training.

Result: Validated on VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving 36.2% and 67.5% parameter reduction while maintaining or surpassing original model performance.

Conclusion: ReDPO and V.I.P enable efficient and high-quality video generation for resource-constrained environments, surpassing prior distillation techniques.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

### [175] [Beyond Isolated Words: Diffusion Brush for Handwritten Text-Line Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03256)
*Gang Dai,Yifan Zhang,Yutao Qin,Qiangya Guo,Shuangping Huang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for generating handwritten text lines, tackling challenges in style imitation and content accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on isolated word generation which doesn’t address the need for coherent handwritten text lines with proper alignment and spacing.

Method: DiffBrush employs content-decoupled style learning via masking and multi-scale content learning using discriminators for better intra- and inter-word style and content coherence.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DiffBrush’s superior ability to generate realistic and coherent handwritten text lines in terms of style and content accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffBrush establishes itself as a promising solution for comprehensive handwritten text-line generation, overcoming limitations of past approaches.

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

### [176] [EgoPrompt: Prompt Pool Learning for Egocentric Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03266)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Yuheng Ji,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Egocentric action recognition involves identifying actions and objects in first-person videos, but current methods treat these tasks separately. EgoPrompt bridges this gap using a prompt learning framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric action recognition is split into recognizing actions and objects. Existing approaches treat these as independent tasks, failing to capture their semantic relationship, resulting in sub-optimal generalization.

Method: EgoPrompt introduces a unified prompt pool to link action (verb) and object (noun) components. It uses pattern decomposition and an attention mechanism for better cross-component representation, supported by a novel training objective for diverse learning.

Result: Experiments on three datasets (Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA) demonstrate EgoPrompt's superior performance in multiple benchmarks, including generalization tasks.

Conclusion: EgoPrompt addresses fragmentation in egocentric action recognition by emphasizing cross-component interaction and representation diversity, setting a new standard for performance.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

*Hang Guo,Qing Zhang,Zixuan Gao,Siyuan Yang,Shulin Peng,Xiang Tao,Ting Yu,Yan Wang,Qingli Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmmPD, a multimodal framework for diagnosing placental diseases, focusing on efficient data processing and integrating global histological context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis of placental diseases is essential to reduce severe maternal and fetal complications, yet challenges in computational and contextual processing in current methods hinder optimal results.

Method: The proposed EmmPD framework uses a two-stage patch selection method for computational efficiency and critical feature preservation, combined with adaptive graph learning and the integration of textual medical reports.

Result: Extensive experiments on a custom placental dataset and public datasets reveal that EmmPD outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: EmmPD successfully addresses computational and contextual challenges in WSI analysis, achieving superior diagnostic performance for placental diseases.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

### [178] [Zero Shot Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03300)
*Jun Luo,Zijing Zhao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDGPA introduces a method for zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation using synthetic training images generated from text-to-image models, tackling distribution shifts between domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in semantic segmentation where there are distribution mismatches between training and test data, especially when no target domain images are available and only text descriptions exist.

Method: The approach uses a text-to-image diffusion model to generate training images in the target domain style, improves spatial precision by editing small image patches, and employs an augmented intermediate domain with progressive adaptation strategies for robust learning.

Result: Experiments reveal that the SDGPA method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles semantic segmentation in scenarios where no direct target domain images are available, showcasing robust adaptation and improved segmentation performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

### [179] [VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03351)
*Yufei Xue,Yushi Huang,Jiawei Shao,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method called VLMQ, tailored for vision-language models (VLMs), to address modality discrepancies and improve performance, especially at lower-bit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods for large language models (LLMs) fail to consider the unique modality discrepancy in VLMs—limited text tokens vs. numerous redundant vision tokens—resulting in performance drops. There is a need to develop a VLM-specific PTQ approach.

Method: The authors propose VLMQ, an importance-aware PTQ framework for VLMs. It optimizes a token-importance-aware objective using an enhanced Hessian matrix and computes token importance factors efficiently via a block-wise backward pass, enabling better treatment of vision token redundancy.

Result: VLMQ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 8 benchmarks for VLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 32B) and significantly improves performance in low-bit quantization settings, e.g., a 16.45% improvement on MME-RealWorld with 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed VLMQ technique successfully addresses modality discrepancies in VLMs and demonstrates its superiority by achieving SOTA performance, particularly in resource-constrained low-bit quantization scenarios.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

*Libo Zhang,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaroPoser combines IMU and barometric data from smartphones and smartwatches for real-time human pose estimation and global translation, even on uneven terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based methods struggle with sparse sensor data and lack datasets for motion capture on uneven terrain, reducing pose estimation accuracy.

Method: BaroPoser integrates IMU and barometric sensor data and introduces a local thigh coordinate frame for pose representation learning, effectively capturing height changes and improving pose accuracy.

Result: BaroPoser outperforms SOTA IMU-based methods, demonstrating superior accuracy in both public benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: BaroPoser advances human motion tracking by leveraging barometric data for global translation and pose estimation on non-flat terrains, expanding the capabilities of IMU-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a taxonomy for Knowledge Distillation (KD) in object detection, categorizing KD methods for both CNN- and Transformer-based detectors. It evaluates these methods and highlights challenges and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational constraints in deploying high-accuracy object detection models on resource-limited devices through the use of Knowledge Distillation.

Method: It presents a novel taxonomy, categorizing KD methods by architecture type (CNN or Transformer) and introduces evaluation metrics using MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets to compare effectiveness.

Result: Representative KD methods were analyzed and compared based on their performance in object detection tasks using mAP@0.5.

Conclusion: The paper provides clarity on the KD landscape for object detection, identifying current challenges and offering insights for developing efficient detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with personalization as they rely on prompt-level modeling, which suffers from token capacity issues, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: DrUM employs user profiling and integrates a transformer-based adapter into the latent space, achieving personalized generation without large-scale fine-tuning.

Result: DrUM exhibits strong performance on large-scale datasets and integrates seamlessly with open-source text encoders.

Conclusion: DrUM improves T2I model personalization by enabling condition-level modeling in latent space, ensuring both compatibility with widely used models and effective user preference incorporation.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of task-specific systems by creating a compact, unified architecture that excels in multimodal image tasks without extensive resource demands.

Method: Skywork UniPic employs a decoupled encoding strategy (masked autoregressive encoder and SigLIP2 encoder feeding shared decoders), progressive resolution-aware training, and curated datasets augmented with task-specific reward models.

Result: The model achieved top GenEval, DPG-Bench, and image editing benchmarks under low hardware requirements (e.g., RTX 4090 and <15 GB GPU memory).

Conclusion: Skywork UniPic demonstrates practical, deployable multimodal AI without prohibitive computational demands, establishing a scalable paradigm for high-fidelity integration in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model

a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on
GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x
1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled
encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis
and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in autoregressive diffusion models for long video synthesis using a novel framework to ensure temporal consistency and efficient parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive diffusion models face challenges like temporal drift and inefficiency when generating long videos.

Method: The authors propose a Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) framework to plan and populate videos in two hierarchical stages—Micro and Macro Planning—followed by parallelized content generation.

Result: MMPL achieved higher video quality and stability compared to existing models and optimized parallelization using adaptive GPU workload scheduling.

Conclusion: MMPL resolves issues in long video generation by enhancing consistency and efficiency, advancing the field of autoregressive video synthesis.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-stage method for recovering details in dark images, using innovative modules to enhance illumination and texture while preserving sharp edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with structural detail loss and noise in dark images, negatively affecting tasks like text and edge detection.

Method: The dual-stage method utilizes Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) for illumination recovery in the frequency domain and Mamba modules for texture refinement, focusing on pixel-level and gradient-based detail enhancement.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in detail recovery across various datasets while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The lightweight modules improve image recovery performance and can integrate seamlessly into other Fourier-based systems.

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

*Muzhaffar Hazman,Susan McKeever,Josephine Griffith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the limitations of current meme analysis methods by proposing broader meme matching approaches beyond template-based matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current meme analysis methods, which focus solely on comparing background templates and exclude non-template-based memes.

Method: The study introduces and compares new similarity computation approaches, including a novel segment-wise similarity method and a prompting-based technique using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model.

Result: Segment-wise similarity measures outperform whole-image methods for non-template-based memes, and the use of pretrained models reveals the complexity of the challenge.

Conclusion: Accurate meme matching across various formats requires advanced techniques, highlighting the need for further research in visual and multimodal matching approaches.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

### [187] [Less is More: Token-Efficient Video-QA via Adaptive Frame-Pruning and Semantic Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03337)
*Shaoguang Wang,Jianxiang He,Yijie Xu,Ziyang Chen,Weiyu Guo,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a method for reducing redundancy and improving efficiency in Video Question Answering (Video-QA) by selecting fewer high-quality video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-QA performance is hampered by high token costs and context dilution when using excessive video frames, and current keyframe selection methods still suffer from temporal redundancy ('visual echoes').

Method: The authors propose AFP, which uses hierarchical clustering on ResNet-50 and CLIP feature spaces to prune redundant keyframes and complements the visual information loss with a semantic graph.

Result: Experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks show AFP reduces required frames by up to 86.9% and token count by 83.2%, while often improving accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: AFP enhances efficiency and often boosts the accuracy of MLLMs applied to Video-QA, highlighting its potential as a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIVQLLIE, a novel low-light image enhancement framework utilizing causal reasoning and vector quantization to address challenges in visibility improvement under nighttime conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing LLIE methods, which either lack interpretability or fail under extreme dark conditions using unreliable priors or physics-based methodologies.

Method: The framework uses a codebook of visual tokens from high-quality images and employs multi-level causal interventions (PCI, FCI, HDRM) to address distribution shifts, enhance degraded channels, and reconstruct fine details.

Result: CIVQLLIE effectively enhances low-light images by leveraging causal interventions and structural information, resulting in improved brightness, color patterns, and detail reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust solution to LLIE challenges by combining discrete representation learning with causal reasoning, showing promise for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

### [189] [WaMo: Wavelet-Enhanced Multi-Frequency Trajectory Analysis for Fine-Grained Text-Motion Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03343)
*Junlong Ren,Gangjian Zhang,Honghao Fu,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaMo, a wavelet-based methodology to improve text-to-motion retrieval tasks by combining multi-frequency motion feature extraction, reconstruction, and disordered sequence prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMR methods struggle with accurately aligning text with 3D motion due to the complexity of human body dynamics, and they often treat body parts uniformly while ignoring their intricate structures.

Method: The proposed WaMo framework consists of three primary components: wavelet decomposition for capturing detailed motion dynamics, wavelet reconstruction to maintain spatial-temporal coherence, and sequence reordering to boost temporal alignment with text.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement, achieving 17.0% and 18.2% gains in Rsum scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach achieves a more nuanced and precise text-motion alignment, demonstrating the effectiveness of wavelet-based feature extraction and learning in improving retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPromo introduces a method to adapt large-scale models to decentralized settings efficiently, by using lightweight proxy models and federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of adapting large-scale foundation models to decentralized client data with limited computational resources.

Method: FedPromo uses a two-stage process involving server-side knowledge distillation and client-side lightweight adaptation, leveraging proxy models and federated learning.

Result: FedPromo achieves improved performance while balancing privacy, computational efficiency, and decentralized adaptation, as shown in experiments on five image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedPromo offers a novel framework for efficient decentralized learning that outperforms existing methods without requiring direct access to user data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

*Ni Tang,Xiaotong Luo,Zihan Cheng,Liangtai Zhou,Dongxiao Zhang,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), an efficient one-step image restoration method leveraging Stable Diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: All-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) using diffusion models is powerful but often hindered by high computational costs and poor adaptability to various degradations.

Method: The method involves multi-degradation feature modulation, conditional low-rank adaptation for fine-tuning with degradation prompts, and a high-fidelity detail enhancement module integrated into Stable Diffusion.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance in image restoration, with better visual quality and inference efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion Once and Done (DOD) provides an effective and efficient solution for adapting Stable Diffusion to different image restoration tasks while overcoming existing limitations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

*Keyi Li,Alexander Jaus,Jens Kleesiek,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GRASP, a framework enhancing pathology segmentation by leveraging existing anatomy models, achieving top performance on PET/CT datasets using a modular and plug-and-play approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in deep learning pathology models which fail to consider anatomical context, crucial for accurate delineation by radiologists.

Method: The authors introduce GRASP, which integrates anatomical knowledge via pseudolabels and feature alignment into existing pathology segmentation models without retraining anatomical components.

Result: GRASP demonstrated strong performance across multiple metrics and architectures on PET/CT datasets, validated through systematic experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: GRASP effectively incorporates anatomical context into pathology segmentation, offering a robust and versatile framework for enhancing model performance without requiring additional anatomical training.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

*Jingjie Wang,Shunli Zhang,Xiang Wei,Senmao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitAdapt and GaitAdapter are introduced for continual gait recognition, allowing incremental learning while maintaining performance on old datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait recognition models fail to retain knowledge when retrained on new datasets, causing performance drops on older data.

Method: The authors introduce GaitAdapter, which uses a GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge module (leveraging graph neural networks) and a Euclidean Distance Stability Method to retain and enhance gait pattern recognition across tasks.

Result: Evaluations show that GaitAdapter significantly outperforms existing methods in retaining knowledge and discriminative capability across tasks.

Conclusion: GaitAdapter successfully addresses knowledge retention challenges in continual gait recognition, enabling stable and improved performance over time.

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAVIA, a novel method to enhance Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) with reduced computational cost in Vision Transformers (ViTs), achieving improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of TTA methods for Vision Transformers while maintaining performance in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The researchers provide a mutual information analysis to understand token aggregation's information loss and propose NAVIA. NAVIA uses information augmentation, augmenting the [CLS] token embedding and incorporating adaptive biases to mitigate performance degradation.

Result: NAVIA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5% in accuracy and reduces inference latency by more than 20% across out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: NAVIA successfully addresses the Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA) problem by balancing reduced computational demands with strong adaptation performance to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

*Xinzhu Li,Juepeng Zheng,Yikun Chen,Xudong Mao,Guanghui Yue,Wei Zhou,Chenlei Lv,Ruomei Wang,Fan Zhou,Baoquan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The "DepthGait" framework uses RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for gait recognition, outperforming other methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D gait representations, such as silhouettes and skeletons, fail to adequately handle challenges like viewpoint variations and finer gait detail.

Method: DepthGait combines RGB-derived depth maps and silhouette representations, incorporating a multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme to mitigate modality gaps.

Result: Extensive benchmarking reveals state-of-the-art accuracy and impressive mean rank-1 performance on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: DepthGait enhances gait recognition through innovative depth-based methodologies and fusion techniques, establishing superior discrimination and recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

*Pingchuan Ma,Xiaopei Yang,Yusong Li,Ming Gui,Felix Krause,Johannes Schusterbauer,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow proposes an invertible merging model for style and content that naturally achieves disentanglement and performs competitively on zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from the semantic overlap between style and content in vision models and the ambiguity in disentangling them explicitly.

Method: The paper introduces SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that employs bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. They utilize systematic style-content pairing in a curated dataset for model training.

Result: SCFlow showcases its ability to generalize in zero-shot settings (e.g., ImageNet-1k, WikiArt) and achieve competitive performance, with disentanglement emerging naturally from the model's structure.

Conclusion: Invertible merging of style and content avoids the need for explicit disentanglement, providing a robust framework for general and natural separations.

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STVMLU, a hyperspectral unmixing method incorporating sparsity and spatial similarity constraints for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate hyperspectral unmixing is crucial to extract material signatures and proportions for various imagery applications.

Method: The STVMLU model uses a multilayer matrix factorization approach with TV and L1/2-norm sparse constraints, optimized using ADMM.

Result: Experiments demonstrate STVMLU outperforms existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms in terms of accuracy.

Conclusion: The STVMLU method is effective and promising for improving hyperspectral unmixing performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper presents MACT, a framework for visual document understanding and visual question answering, which combines multiple small agents to address VLM limitations and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with long visual contexts, complex reasoning, and self-correction, leading to suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.

Method: The authors propose MACT, a framework with four distinct agents (planning, execution, judgment, and answer) that collaborate effectively. It includes mixed reward modeling and agent-specific hybrid test-time scaling for improved capabilities.

Result: MACT outperforms benchmark models across both document and non-document-based tasks, achieving leading scores in 13 of 15 benchmarks while maintaining a smaller parameter scale.

Conclusion: MACT demonstrates the potential for improved performance in VLMs through multi-agent collaboration and smarter scaling techniques, excelling in tasks requiring long visual context and complex reasoning.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlotMatch, a knowledge distillation framework for unsupervised video segmentation that transfers object-centric representations to lightweight models, outperforming previous methods while using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised video segmentation is difficult due to a lack of supervisory signals and the visual complexity of scenes, driving a need for efficient models.

Method: The SlotMatch framework aligns teacher and student slots through cosine similarity without additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision.

Result: SlotMatch produces a student model that matches or outperforms state-of-the-art SlotContrast, using 3.6x fewer parameters and running 1.9x faster, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: SlotMatch provides a streamlined and effective approach for unsupervised video segmentation, demonstrating comparable or superior performance with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in image-to-image translation such as achieving realistic distributions, fine-grained semantic accuracy, and structural coherence, especially under limited data conditions.

Method: The methodology integrates CycleGAN with Local Neighborhood Encoding, frequency-aware supervision, and distribution-based loss metrics (KL/JS divergence and log-based measures) to align generated images with real data distributions.

Result: Experimental validation on datasets like Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and synthetic datasets demonstrates superior visual quality, faster convergence, and enhanced diversity compared to CycleGAN and diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: The approach successfully improves image translation generalization and applicability in domains like artistic style transfer, medical imaging, and document restoration, offering lightweight and efficient training advantages.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Motivation: To address challenges like hallucination and weak diagnostic capabilities in automated medical report generation despite advancements in AI.

Method: Constructed a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (M3KG), employed an R-GCN encoder and Swin-Transformer for feature extraction, and utilized cross-attention mechanisms and large language models to generate medical reports.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework for improving the quality of X-ray report generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates vision and semantic knowledge to enhance medical report generation. The source code is available for future use.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in EEG signal classification caused by data distribution shifts arising from differences in electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware across domains.

Result: IMAC was evaluated on 10 EEG datasets and demonstrated state-of-the-art classification accuracy in diverse scenarios. It showed robustness to simulated and real-world distribution shifts, outperforming baselines by up to 35% in integrity scores.

Conclusion: IMAC effectively aligns cross-domain EEG data shifts, displaying significant robustness and adaptability while maintaining high classification accuracy in various conditions.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode

domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

### [203] [MedCAL-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark on Cold-Start Active Learning with Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03441)
*Ning Zhu,Xiaochuan Ma,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic benchmark to evaluate pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) for Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) in medical image analysis, comparing 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across diverse tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve annotation efficiency and model performance for medical image analysis under limited annotation budgets, addressing inefficiencies and limited feature representation in existing CSAL methods.

Method: The authors developed MedCAL-Bench, a benchmark comparing 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 medical image datasets, assessing both classification and segmentation tasks while evaluating both feature extraction and sample selection stages.

Result: The study found that most FMs are effective for CSAL, with DINO excelling in segmentation tasks. Performance variation is larger for segmentation than classification. ALPS performed best in segmentation sample selection, while RepDiv excelled in classification.

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench highlights the potential of FMs in CSAL tasks, showing the need to tailor sample selection strategies for different datasets and tasks. The benchmark lays a foundation for further research in FM-based CSAL strategies.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

### [204] [RAAG: Ratio Aware Adaptive Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03442)
*Shangwen Zhu,Qianyu Peng,Yuting Hu,Zhantao Yang,Han Zhang,Zhao Pu,Ruili Feng,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an instability in flow-based generative models caused by early-stage sensitivity to guidance scales, proposing an adaptive schedule that improves sampling speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate and address the instability in classifier-free guidance observed during early sampling steps in flow-based generative models, which hinders fast and high-quality image and video generation.

Method: The authors uncover an intrinsic instability caused by the RATIO spike during early reverse steps. They propose a RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule, employing a closed-form exponential decay model for automatic adjustment of the guidance scale.

Result: Their adaptive guidance schedule achieves up to a 3x faster sampling speed while maintaining or improving the quality, robustness, and semantic alignment of images and videos across models like SD3.5, Lumina, and WAN2.1.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of stepwise guidance adaptation to fully exploit the capabilities of fast flow-based generative models, demonstrating the generality, stability, and efficiency of the proposed adjustment technique.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

### [205] [CoPS: Conditional Prompt Synthesis for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03447)
*Qiyu Chen,Zhen Qu,Wei Luo,Haiming Yao,Yunkang Cao,Yuxin Jiang,Yinan Duan,Huiyuan Luo,Chengkan Lv,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework, Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), to improve zero-shot anomaly detection by dynamically generating prompts conditioned on visual features. It outperforms existing methods on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of vision-language models in zero-shot anomaly detection, challenges remain due to static learnable tokens and fixed labels, which limit generalization and make the models prone to overfitting.

Method: The paper proposes CoPS, which uses dynamic visual-feature-conditioned prompts. It incorporates normal and anomaly prototypes, fine-grained features, and a variational autoencoder for semantic modeling, along with spatial alignment mechanisms.

Result: CoPS demonstrates a 2.5% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art methods across 13 datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical lesions.

Conclusion: Dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features offer significant improvements for zero-shot anomaly detection, eliminating static and sparse modeling issues in prior methods.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

### [206] [Video Demoireing using Focused-Defocused Dual-Camera System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03449)
*Xuan Dong,Xiangyuan Sun,Xia Wang,Jian Song,Ya Li,Weixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses moire pattern removal in images and videos by introducing a dual-camera framework utilizing one focused and one defocused camera for improved demoireing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moire patterns disrupt image and video quality, and current methods struggle to differentiate these artifacts from real textures while maintaining tonal and temporal consistency.

Method: A dual-camera system is proposed, capturing one focused and one defocused video. Optical flow alignment aligns these frames, a multi-scale CNN aids demoireing, and a joint bilateral filter preserves consistency.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing demoireing techniques in removal quality and consistency.

Conclusion: The dual-camera approach effectively removes moire patterns, advancing video and image demoireing beyond current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

### [207] [AVPDN: Learning Motion-Robust and Scale-Adaptive Representations for Video-Based Polyp Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03458)
*Zilin Chen,Shengnan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AVPDN, a multi-scale polyp detection framework for colonoscopy videos, addressing challenges like rapid camera movement and background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate polyp detection in colonoscopy videos is crucial for diagnosing colorectal cancer, but rapid camera movements introduce noise and risk false positives.

Method: AVPDN includes the AFIA module for enhanced feature representation using dense and sparse self-attention, and the SACI module for multi-scale feature integration via dilated convolutions.

Result: AVPDN demonstrates high effectiveness in video-based polyp detection tasks across multiple public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AVPDN framework significantly improves video-based polyp detection, showcasing robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

### [208] [IKOD: Mitigating Visual Attention Degradation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03469)
*Jiabing Yang,Chenhang Cui,Yiyang Zhou,Yixiang Chen,Peng Xia,Ying Wei,Tao Yu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by proposing a lightweight strategy called IKOD that mitigates attention degradation during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the challenge of hallucinations in LVLMs, a result of diminishing visual attention as sequence length grows, without requiring costly computational or annotation resources.

Method: The authors propose IKOD (Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding), which improves image-focused sequence generation by merging key-value pairs from shorter, high-attention sequences with the original decoding process.

Result: IKOD is shown to effectively mitigate hallucinations while enhancing the overall performance of LVLMs on various benchmarks, all without incurring significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: IKOD offers a lightweight, training-free, and efficient framework for improving LVLMs by addressing visual attention degradation, thus benefiting a wide range of vision-language applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

### [209] [VideoGuard: Protecting Video Content from Unauthorized Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03480)
*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "VideoGuard," a method to protect videos from malicious editing by generative models, using subtle perturbations that disrupt the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the risk of misuse of generative technology to maliciously edit videos, coupled with the lack of effective protection mechanisms for video content compared to images.

Method: VideoGuard employs joint frame optimization, leveraging video motion information, and perturbation strategies to disrupt generative diffusion models. These perturbations make unauthorized edits implausible and inconsistent.

Result: The experimental results, assessed with objective and subjective metrics, demonstrate that VideoGuard outperforms existing baseline methods in protecting videos from unauthorized editing.

Conclusion: VideoGuard successfully safeguards video content against malicious editing by generative models, addressing a critical gap in protection mechanisms.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

### [210] [When Cars Have Stereotypes: Auditing Demographic Bias in Objects from Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03483)
*Dasol Choi Jihwan Lee,Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SODA, a framework to analyze demographic biases in text-to-image generation for objects, finding recurring stereotypes and disparities in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and address subtle demographic biases in generated object images that have been overlooked compared to biases in human depictions.

Method: Developed SODA framework to systematically measure biases by comparing visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues to neutral prompts, analyzing outputs from three state-of-the-art models across five object categories.

Result: Finds strong connections between demographic cues and visual attributes, revealing both traditional stereotypes and unintuitive biases, along with diversity reduction in certain model outputs.

Conclusion: SODA highlights embedded stereotypes in generative models and offers a practical auditing tool for mitigating biases in AI development.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LRQ-DiT, an efficient framework for low-bit post-training quantization of Diffusion Transformers, addressing distribution and activation challenges, and achieves high image quality with reduced computation demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers offer strong text-to-image generation capabilities but are challenged by high computational and memory costs, requiring efficient methods for resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ) for weight distribution alignment and Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) to mitigate activation outliers, enabling effective low-bit PTQ for DiT models.

Result: LRQ-DiT successfully preserves image quality while achieving superior low-bit quantization compared to existing methods across datasets like COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI.

Conclusion: The proposed LRQ-DiT framework is effective in reducing computation and memory demands for DiT models through innovative quantization techniques, resolving key obstacles and outperforming previous PTQ methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ParticleSAM, an adaptation of SAM for dense images to facilitate quality control of recycled construction materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality monitoring of recycled construction aggregates is slow and inefficient. The paper aims to leverage machine learning for automated segmentation of small, dense objects.

Method: The authors developed ParticleSAM by modifying SAM for better segmentation of dense, small objects and created a benchmark dataset using an automated pipeline.

Result: Experimental findings showed ParticleSAM outperformed the original SAM in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: ParticleSAM and its associated dataset present a promising solution for automating visual quality control in construction and other domains requiring small particle segmentation.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Mohammadsadegh Khoshghiaferezaee,Moritz Krauth,Shima Shabani,Michael Breuß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDL is used for image recovery, demonstrating that high sparsity in solutions does not compromise recovery quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the degree of sparsity to enforce in SDL without compromising image recovery quality.

Method: Comparative analysis of sparsity regimes using different optimization methods in SDL.

Result: High sparsity in SDL solutions does not negatively impact recovery quality, even when the recovered image differs from the learning database.

Conclusion: Maintaining high sparsity in SDL is beneficial for efficient processing and storage, without degrading recovery quality.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PECM framework to improve medical cross-modal retrieval tasks by addressing data ambiguity using multi-level prototypes and confidence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with capturing semantic relationships in medical images and text due to variability and ambiguity.

Method: The PECM framework utilizes multi-level prototypes and dual-stream confidence estimation to enhance semantic representation and adjust for uncertain data.

Result: PECM achieves significant accuracy improvements, up to 10.17%, across various datasets and retrieval tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The PECM framework effectively enhances retrieval robustness and precision in medical cross-modal tasks, tackling challenges of data ambiguity in clinical contexts.

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EditGarment, a dataset for instruction-based garment image editing for fashion, addressing the challenges of limited data and semantic dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of manual annotation costs and the lack of fashion-specific data needed for garment image editing systems, and to advance the application of natural language to precise clothing customization and design.

Method: The authors created a pipeline defining six instruction categories relevant to fashion workflows, and used a new evaluation metric called Fashion Edit Score for semantic-aware supervision. This enabled the automated generation and filtering of instruction-image triplets.

Result: A total of 52,257 candidate triplets were generated, with 20,596 high-quality triplets curated to form EditGarment, the first dataset specifically designed for instruction-based garment editing.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset serves as the first benchmark for standalone garment editing, offering a significant stepping stone for enabling high-quality, natural-language-driven fashion design and editing workflows.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free approach for segmenting medical images using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) adapted by Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of existing models on extensive training over other medical domains makes cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation less universal and harder to deploy.

Method: This method employs a prompting strategy (MAUP) that includes multi-center prompts generation using K-means clustering, uncertainty-aware selection focusing on challenging regions, and adaptive optimization based on the complexity of the target area.

Result: Using SAM and a DINOv2 feature encoder, the model achieves precise segmentation across three medical datasets without any extra training, outperforming conventional CD-FSMIS and training-free FSMIS models.

Conclusion: MAUP demonstrates the potential of training-free adaptation of natural image foundation models for medical image segmentation, simplifying deployment and maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

### [217] [Distribution-aware Knowledge Unification and Association for Non-exemplar Lifelong Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03516)
*Shiben Liu,Mingyue Xu,Huijie Fan,Qiang Wang,Yandong Tang,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for lifelong person re-identification (LReID) focusing on balancing knowledge preservation and adaptability across different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations in existing LReID methods, which fail to address distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning—critical aspects for better anti-forgetting and generalization.

Method: The proposed Distribution-aware Knowledge Unification and Association (DKUA) framework integrates domain-style modeling for instance-level representations, adaptive knowledge consolidation for unified cross-domain representation, unified knowledge association for inter-domain linkage, and distribution-based knowledge transfer to stabilize domain representations.

Result: Experiments indicate significant improvements, with DKUA achieving 7.6% higher anti-forgetting and 5.3% better generalization average mAP/R@1 scores compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: DKUA effectively addresses anti-forgetting and generalization challenges in LReID by leveraging distribution-aware modeling and unified cross-domain learning, marking advancements in lifelong learning paradigms.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticStitcher improves automated stitching of histopathology tissue sample fragments by using latent features from a visual foundation model, achieving robust mosaicing and surpassing current boundary shape-matching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating whole mount slides (WMS) due to issues like tissue distortion, staining inconsistencies, and misalignment, which hinder scalability and accuracy of automated stitching methods.

Method: SemanticStitcher utilizes latent feature representations from a histopathology foundation visual model and robust pose estimation to identify and stitch neighboring areas of tissue fragments.

Result: Controlled experiments across three histopathology datasets reveal that SemanticStitcher provides robust mosaicing of fragmented tissue samples and outperforms existing methods in boundary matching accuracy.

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher offers a more reliable and effective solution to histopathology tissue mosaicing, enabling scaled-up analysis of larger structures like tumors through improved stitching technology.

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

*Kaishen Yuan,Yuting Zhang,Shang Gao,Yijie Zhu,Wenshuo Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CoEmoGen, a model for generating emotionally faithful and semantically coherent images using advanced techniques and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to generate abstract emotional images clearly and coherently, relying excessively on problematic word-level attribute labels.

Method: They use multimodal large language models for better captions and a Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation module inspired by psychology to integrate low-level and high-level features.

Result: CoEmoGen exhibits superior emotional fidelity and semantic coherence across various evaluations and introduces the EmoArt dataset to showcase scalability.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen effectively addresses limitations in emotional image generation, offering scalable solutions and new resources for emotion-driven artistic creation.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

### [220] [Retinal Lipidomics Associations as Candidate Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03538)
*Inamullah,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how lipidomic subclasses relate to retinal microvascular characteristics, highlighting retinal imaging as a potential non-invasive marker for systemic health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited understanding of the relationship between lipidomics and retinal vasculature, despite the recognition of retinal imaging as a method to evaluate systemic vascular and metabolic health.

Method: The authors used Spearman correlation analysis and the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) adjustment to examine links between serum lipid subclasses and retinal microvascular traits in a large population-based cohort.

Result: Fatty acids (FA) were associated with retinal vessel twistiness, cholesteryl esters (CE) with average artery and vein widths, and diacylglycerols (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG) were negatively correlated with arteriolar and venular width and complexity.

Conclusion: Retinal microvascular structure reflects distinct lipid profiles, reinforcing the prospect of using retinal imaging as a non-invasive indicator of systemic metabolic health, independent of disease conditions or treatments.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

*Long Qian,Bingke Zhu,Yingying Chen,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARAS is a novel auto-regressive anomaly synthesis framework that overcomes existing deficiencies via text-conditioned latent editing and integrates into a Quality-Aware anomaly detection system (QARAD) for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly synthesis methods face challenges like micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic control, and inefficiencies, necessitating improved techniques.

Method: This paper introduces ARAS, a language-conditioned anomaly synthesis approach using token-anchored latent editing, a hard-gated auto-regressive operator, and a training-free masked sampling kernel. Additionally, QARAD integrates image-text similarity scores for quality-aware anomaly detection.

Result: ARAS demonstrates superior defect realism, material texture preservation, and semantic control. It integrates into QARAD, achieving enhanced anomaly detection performance across benchmarks while being five times faster in synthesis compared to diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: The study presents ARAS and QARAD as effective methods for anomaly synthesis and detection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and efficiency with publicly available code and datasets forthcoming.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of converting spoken mathematical expressions into LaTeX, introducing a large-scale dataset and showing significant improvements over existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited exploration, datasets, and performance in converting spoken mathematical expressions into LaTeX, which is essential for educational and research applications.

Method: The authors present a large-scale open-source dataset of 66,000 annotated audio samples in English and Russian, and employ ASR post-correction models, few-shot prompting, and audio language models to improve accuracy.

Result: Their models achieve better performance on new benchmarks for equations and sentences, significantly improving character error rates compared to prior work.

Conclusion: This study introduces innovative datasets and techniques that advance the field of spoken mathematical content recognition, unlocking new multimodal AI applications.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

*Stephanie Wohlfahrt,Christoph Praschl,Horst Leitner,Wolfram Jantsch,Julia Konic,Silvio Schueler,Andreas Stöckl,David C. Schedl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unmanned aerial drones were used to estimate wildlife density in southeastern Austria, showing promising and scalable results when compared to traditional camera trap methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife density estimation methods like camera traps are labor-intensive or spatially constrained, necessitating efficient alternatives like drones.

Method: Drones equipped with IR and RGB cameras surveyed three areas during leafless periods, utilizing predefined flight paths and altitude to minimize disturbance, then manually annotated imagery was analyzed using three extrapolation methods.

Result: Drone-based density estimates were generally higher than camera trap-based estimates (REM), suggesting different perspectives on wildlife presence.

Conclusion: Drones prove to be an effective, scalable solution for wildlife density estimation, with distinct advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

### [224] [A Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline for Building Footprint Detection in Historical Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03564)
*Annemarie McCarthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable approach using hierarchical machine learning to efficiently analyze rural historical maps for sparse building distributions, aiding historical and archaeological discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods for extracting building footprints have limitations, particularly in computational efficiency and focus on urban areas, making them unsuitable for extensive rural analyses.

Method: The pipeline uses a hierarchical machine learning approach, employing CNN classifiers to filter unlikely map sections, followed by CNN segmentation algorithms to process high-probability sections for building feature extraction.

Result: The method demonstrated high performance and efficiency on the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical map series, uncovering settlements and providing insights into historical events like the Great Famine.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is effective for scalable analysis of rural historical maps, paving the way for broader applications in historical and archaeological research.

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Motivation: To address the challenge of developing a powerful and generalizable encoder for improved segmentation performance across various tasks.

Method: The authors enhance SAM2 by incorporating DINOv2 as an auxiliary encoder, using a dual-resolution strategy and dense glue layer to provide more accurate segmentation while simplifying architecture design.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse benchmarks showed superior segmentation performance using SAM2-UNeXT compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT demonstrates that integrating an advanced encoder setup can provide efficient and high-performing segmentation capabilities without the need for complex architectural designs.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadProPoser, a novel probabilistic architecture for radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) that provides accurate joint position predictions along with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based HPE faces challenges such as noisy and multipath-affected measurements. The authors aim to develop a reliable and privacy-preserving system that incorporates uncertainty quantification.

Method: RadProPoser is a probabilistic encoder-decoder model utilizing complex radar tensors. It employs variational inference for keypoint regression, predicting 3D joint locations and uncertainties using probabilistic distributions like Gaussian and Laplace.

Result: The proposed system achieved a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with calibrated uncertainties and strong alignment between predicted and actual errors. It also showed success in activity classification with an F1 score of 0.870.

Conclusion: RadProPoser establishes a robust foundation for reliable and explainable human motion analysis using radar data. The integration of uncertainty modeling enhances its applicability for various radar-based applications.

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetaScope, a neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy, addressing optical challenges like intensity decay and chromatic aberrations. It improves segmentation and restoration performance in biomedical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional millimeter-scale lenses in miniaturized endoscopy and the need to overcome the lack of data and algorithms for the emerging metalens technologies.

Method: The approach involves creating datasets for metalens endoscopy, identifying optical issues, and developing MetaScope, which integrates optics-informed neural designs for intensity and chromatic correction.

Result: MetaScope outperforms existing methods in segmentation and restoration tasks while exhibiting strong generalization in real-world biomedical scenarios.

Conclusion: MetaScope bridges the gap between metalens physics and algorithm research, contributing to the advancement of metalens endoscopy and its practical applications in medicine.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyCAF-Net enhances object detection with dynamic multi-scale fusion and class-aware adaptations, achieving notable improvements across challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection methods face limitations in dynamic scenes due to occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance, requiring innovations in feature fusion and attention mechanisms.

Method: Design of DyCAF-Net includes equilibrium-based neck for feature refinement, dual dynamic attention for class-dependent cues, and class-aware feature adaptation to focus on rare classes.

Result: DyCAF-Net demonstrates improved precision and mAP metrics across 13 diverse benchmarks, surpassing nine state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficiency with 11.1M parameters.

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net proves to be an efficient and adaptable solution for object detection in complex real-world scenarios like medical imaging and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

*Saleh Sakib Ahmed,Sara Nowreen,M. Sohel Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CloudBreaker, a framework that uses radar data from Sentinel-1 to generate high-quality multi-spectral imagery typically acquired by Sentinel-2, mitigating cloud and nighttime limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based remote sensing faces challenges like cloud cover and night conditions that restrict the usability of multi-spectral imagery. Sentinel-1 radar data offers an alternative unaffected by these limitations, but a bridging framework is needed to recreate Sentinel-2 data.

Method: CloudBreaker uses a multi-stage training approach based on conditional latent flow matching and incorporates cosine scheduling into flow matching to generate multi-spectral signals, including optical images and indices like NDVI and NDWI.

Result: CloudBreaker achieves a high performance with a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 0.7432 and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) scores of 0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, showing realism and structural similarity.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker is a promising solution that enhances remote sensing applications by generating reliable multi-spectral imagery from radar data, circumventing challenges posed by clouds and nighttime conditions.

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach

are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural

### [230] [evTransFER: A Transfer Learning Framework for Event-based Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03609)
*Rodrigo Verschae,Ignacio Bugueno-Cordova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework for face expression recognition using event-based cameras, achieving superior results over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras offer advantages in capturing spatio-temporal dynamics with high temporal resolution and microsecond latency. The research aims to leverage this capability for improved facial expression recognition.

Method: The authors proposed evTransFER utilizing transfer learning. They trained a feature extractor on facial reconstruction tasks, then transferred its weights to a facial expression recognition system. An architecture combining LSTM with a novel event-based representation 'TIE' was also developed.

Result: evTransFER demonstrated a 93.6% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database, improving accuracy by at least 25.9 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances facial expression recognition using event-based cameras, showcasing the effectiveness of transfer learning and novel representation techniques.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Uni3R, a framework for reconstructing 3D scenes enriched with semantic understanding from sparse 2D views, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from sparse, unposed 2D images without relying on costly or scene-specific methods.

Method: Uni3R employs a Cross-View Transformer to integrate multi-view data, reconstructing a set of 3D Gaussian primitives with semantic feature fields for unified scene representation.

Result: Uni3R delivers state-of-the-art performance with metrics like 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet, demonstrating its efficacy in novel view synthesis, semantic segmentation, and depth prediction.

Conclusion: Uni3R represents a significant advancement in scalable, generalizable 3D scene reconstruction and semantic understanding without per-scene optimization.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongVie, a framework for generating ultra-long videos with improved temporal consistency and visual quality, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to overcome challenges such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation in ultra-long video generation, which current methods struggle to solve for extended video durations.

Method: The authors propose LongVie, which includes: 1) a unified noise initialization strategy for temporal consistency, 2) global control signal normalization, 3) a multi-modal control framework combining dense and sparse signals, and 4) a degradation-aware training strategy to mitigate visual issues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LongVie achieves superior performance in generating consistent, high-quality, and controllable long videos, validated on the LongVGenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: LongVie sets a new benchmark in controllable long video generation by addressing temporal and visual quality issues, supported by a newly introduced comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Trokens," which enhances few-shot action recognition via a novel method of converting trajectory points into relational tokens for combining motion and appearance features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two key challenges in few-shot action recognition: how to select informative trajectory points for tracking and how to effectively model their motion dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a semantic-aware sampling strategy for adaptive point selection and a motion modeling framework that uses Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) for intra-trajectory dynamics. They also model inter-trajectory relationships to capture complex actions and integrate these with semantic features.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on six few-shot action recognition benchmarks, including Something-Something-V2, Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Conclusion: Trokens effectively combines motion modeling with semantic understanding to overcome limitations in few-shot action recognition, demonstrating strong adaptability and improved performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

*Wei Li,Limei Hu,Feng Chen,Ye Yao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a resilient distributed estimation algorithm to improve parameter accuracy in multi-task adversarial networks, addressing challenges from attacked nodes or links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve distributed parameter estimation in multi-task adversarial networks, which is compromised by attacks on nodes or links.

Method: The algorithm incorporates a node selection strategy using reputations, employs the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model for trust evaluation, and utilizes an event-triggered mechanism to reduce model updates.

Result: Simulation results show that the algorithm performs better with fewer communication costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm enhances resilience and efficiency in distributed estimation for adversarial environments.

Abstract: In multi-task adversarial networks, the accurate estimation of unknown
parameters in a distributed algorithm is hindered by attacked nodes or links.
To tackle this challenge, this brief proposes a low-communication resilient
distributed estimation algorithm. First, a node selection strategy based on
reputation is introduced that allows nodes to communicate with more reliable
subset of neighbors. Subsequently, to discern trustworthy intermediate
estimates, the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model is
employed to train the memory data. This trained model contributes to reinforce
the resilience of the distributed estimation process against the impact of
attacked nodes or links. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is
introduced to minimize ineffective updates to the W-SVDD model, and a suitable
threshold is derived based on assumptions. The convergence of the algorithm is
analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
achieves superior performance with less communication cost compared to other
algorithms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PROV-AGENT, a provenance model designed to improve transparency, traceability, and reproducibility in workflows involving autonomous AI agents, addressing challenges like error propagation when agents interact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous AI agents play a central role in complex workflows, but there are challenges in ensuring reliability due to errors or incorrect reasoning. Existing provenance techniques fail to properly integrate agent-specific metadata into the workflow.

Method: The authors extend the W3C PROV standard using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a real-time system capable of capturing interactions and context for agent decision-making within workflows.

Result: The proposed system provides provenance capture across diverse environments (edge, cloud, HPC), enabling critical queries and analyses that reveal agent reliability and support reproducibility.

Conclusion: PROV-AGENT bridges the gap in current provenance techniques by providing a model specifically tailored for agent-driven workflows, enhancing the reliability and transparency of scientific outcomes.

Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly
used as core components of AI agents in complex, large-scale workflows across
federated and heterogeneous environments. In agentic workflows, autonomous
agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and shape scientific
outcomes. This makes transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and
reliability essential. However, AI-based agents can hallucinate or reason
incorrectly, and their decisions may propagate errors through the workflow,
especially when one agent's output feeds into another's input. Therefore,
fine-grained provenance is essential to link agent decisions, their end-to-end
context, and downstream impacts. While provenance techniques have long
supported reproducibility and workflow data understanding, they fail to capture
and relate agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, and decisions) with the
rest of the workflow. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance
model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to
integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our
contributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows,
(2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and
(3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments,
demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability
analysis.

TL;DR: The paper revisits epistemic logic analyses for Simultaneous Byzantine Agreement by exploring more practical, less resource-demanding information exchange protocols, and provides insights into optimality conditions for such protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epistemic logic analyses of distributed algorithms often depend on full information protocols, which are inefficient in terms of space and computation. This study aims to explore more practical and efficient protocols.

Method: The paper examines the problem of Simultaneous Byzantine Agreement under weaker information-exchange protocols. It clarifies foundational issues, implements a knowledge-based solution for specific failure models, and identifies conditions for optimality.

Result: The knowledge-based program leads to an optimal protocol relative to given information exchange conditions. However, it demonstrates that these results don't universally apply through a counter-example.

Conclusion: While practical protocols can achieve optimality under specific conditions, generalizations are limited. The paper contributes clarifications and identifies scenarios of optimality and non-optimality.

Abstract: In order to develop solutions that perform actions as early as possible,
analysis of distributed algorithms using epistemic logic has generally
concentrated on ``full information protocols'', which may be inefficient with
respect to space and computation time. The paper reconsiders the epistemic
analysis of the problem of Simultaneous Byzantine Agreement with respect to
weaker, but more practical, exchanges of information. The paper first clarifies
some issues concerning both the specification of this problem and the knowledge
based program characterizing its solution, concerning the distinction between
the notions of ``nonfaulty'' and ``not yet failed'', on which there are
variances in the literature. It is then shown that, when implemented relative
to a given failure model and an information exchange protocol satisfying
certain conditions, this knowledge based program yields a protocol that is
optimal relative to solutions using the same information exchange. Conditions
are also identified under which this implementation is also an optimum, but an
example is provided that shows this does not hold in general.

Motivation: The paper addresses the computational inefficiency and memory bottlenecks in parallel processing systems, particularly for LDPC codes used in error correction.

Method: The authors leverage the processing-in-memory (PiM) paradigm by designing compute units near memory within the UPMEM system for efficient LDPC decoding.

Result: The proposed PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoders achieve a throughput of 76 Mbit/s and are competitive with optimized low-power GPU solutions.

Conclusion: Using a PiM-based approach for non-binary LDPC decoding can effectively compete with traditional GPU implementations, offering an efficient solution to data movement bottlenecks and parallel processing constraints.

Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are an important feature of several
communication and storage applications, offering a flexible and effective
method for error correction. These codes are computationally complex and
require the exploitation of parallel processing to meet real-time constraints.
As advancements in arithmetic and logic unit technology allowed for higher
performance of computing systems, memory technology has not kept the same pace
of development, creating a data movement bottleneck and affecting parallel
processing systems more dramatically. To alleviate the severity of this
bottleneck, several solutions have been proposed, namely the processing
in-memory (PiM) paradigm that involves the design of compute units to where (or
near) the data is stored, utilizing thousands of low-complexity processing
units to perform out bit-wise and simple arithmetic operations. This paper
presents a novel efficient solution for near-memory non-binary LDPC decoders in
the UPMEM system, for the best of our knowledge the first real hardware
PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoder that is benchmarked against low-power GPU
parallel solutions highly optimized for throughput performance. PiM-based
non-binary LDPC decoders can achieve 76 Mbit/s of decoding throughput, which is
even competitive when compared against implementations running in edge GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems rely on monolithic and heuristic schedulers, leading to inefficiencies in scalability, reliability, and predictive performance.

Method: Block uses a distributed, stateless, predictive scheduling approach leveraging deterministic LLM inference characteristics to achieve efficient task management.

Result: Block improves serving capacity by up to 16.7% and reduces P99 tail latency by up to 49.5% in a 12 GPU cluster.

Conclusion: Block enhances scalability, reliability, and scheduling efficiency in LLM serving environments, with demonstrated performance benefits across variable configurations.

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to
optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large
language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from
incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic
and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,
stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,
reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable
characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response
lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on
accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block
significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up
to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance
gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need fine-tuning to optimize their performance in specialized applications. Existing hybrid PEFT methods lack uncertainty quantification and adaptability to new data.

Method: BH-PEFT integrates Bayesian learning with Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning. It enables uncertainty quantification by modeling parameters as distributions and proposes a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach.

Result: The method outperformed current PEFT baselines in tasks like sentiment analysis and news categorization while offering better adaptability and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: BH-PEFT enhances decision-making in dynamic and real-world scenarios by offering a novel uncertainty-aware and adaptive fine-tuning method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Conclusion: ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust alternative to Adam, excelling in noisy or high-granularity classification scenarios.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam

*Yongfan Lai,Bo Liu,Xinyan Guan,Qinghao Zhao,Hongyan Li,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECGTwin is a framework for personalized ECG generation using individual features and cardiac conditions to create accurate digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in personalized ECG generation, which involves simulating patient-specific scenarios without ground truth data.

Method: A two-stage framework: contrastive learning for extracting features and diffusion-based generation with AdaX condition injection.

Result: ECGTwin effectively generates diverse, high-fidelity ECG signals tailored to individuals and improves auto-diagnosis performance.

Conclusion: ECGTwin advances personalized healthcare by enabling precise individual ECG synthesis and enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: The study aims to utilize advanced AI and statistical models to improve forecasting in NCAA basketball tournaments, addressing the challenges of predictive accuracy and probability calibration.

Method: The research employs LSTM and Transformer models, enhanced with features like GLM metrics, Elo ratings, seed differences, and box-score stats. Models are evaluated using both BCE and Brier loss functions.

(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU as novel spatiotemporal models that enhance both efficiency and performance in tasks like Navier-Stokes dynamics and geopotential forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the inefficiency of traditional ConvRNN models due to sequential hidden state updates while maintaining localized spatiotemporal modeling capabilities.

Method: The paper implements a log-domain prefix-sum formulation for convolutional architectures and an exponential gating mechanism inspired by xLSTM, reducing computational rigidity and improving parallelizability.

Result: MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU outperform standard ConvLSTM and ConvGRU in both training speed and prediction accuracy across spatiotemporal forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that structurally minimal recurrent networks combined with convolutional input aggregation provide an efficient and effective solution for spatiotemporal sequence modeling.

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced probabilistic model for FeFETs to address randomness from operational cycling and fabrication variability, achieving high accuracy and variability-aware simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFETs promise significant advancements in memory and logic technologies but face challenges from inherent randomness and variability, which existing models fail to capture accurately or stably.

Method: The study develops a probabilistic modeling framework based on a Mixture Density Network (MDN) with C-infinity activation functions for smooth learning and device-specific embedding layers for capturing physical variability.

Result: The model achieves a high accuracy with an R2 of 0.92 in capturing the variability of FeFET current behavior and enables synthetic device generation for variability-aware simulation.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable solution for modeling FeFET behavior, paving the way for robust compact model development and circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of least-squares regression techniques in handling asymmetric structured noise, particularly for scenarios involving wearable synthetic data.

Method: Employing a transformer encoder for numerical sequence processing, coupled with a compression neural network predicting symbolic parameters, and reconstructing sequences through a fixed symbolic equation. Synthetic data is used for training.

Result: Achieves regression mean square error (MSE) between 6e-6 and 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data—a significant 10-300x improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid neural-symbolic architecture outperforms traditional regression techniques, offering a highly effective solution for handling asymmetric structured noise.

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement

*Sukruta Prakash Midigeshi,Tanmay Goyal,Gaurav Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two algorithms for multinomial logistic bandits with limited policy updates, achieving competitive results compared to frequent-update baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world constraints where algorithms need limited adaptivity in updating policies, while maintaining computational efficiency and optimal regret.

Method: Two algorithms are developed: B-MNL-CB for batched policy updates, assuming stochastic contexts, and RS-MNL for rarely-switching updates, handling adversarial contexts.

Result: B-MNL-CB achieves \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\) regret with \(\Omega(\log \log T)\) updates, and RS-MNL achieves \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\) regret with \(\tilde{O}(\log T)\) updates. Experimental results show these outperform frequent-update baselines in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms demonstrate that even with a fixed, limited number of updates, competitive performance is achievable, showcasing real-world applicability.

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly
sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an

Motivation: There is a need to better understand and improve the theoretical properties (e.g., Wasserstein distance convergence) of diffusion-based generative models, including initialization, discretization, and score estimation errors.

Method: The paper develops a general analytical framework for understanding errors due to discretization, initialization, and score estimation, including examining the spatial regularity of the learned score function and leveraging smoothed Wasserstein distances.

Result: The authors derive Wasserstein convergence bounds for the Heun sampler, improve bounds for the Euler sampler, and provide sharper initialization error analyses using recent developments in smoothed Wasserstein distances.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the critical role of spatial regularity of the score function and call for controlling score estimation errors relative to the true reverse process in diffusion-based generative modeling.

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmallKV, a method that uses a small model to address issues in KV cache eviction for LLMs, improving efficiency and performance in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current token-level KV cache eviction methods, which fail to adapt to dynamic attention patterns and disregard the importance of marginal tokens.

Method: SmallKV uses a small model to compensate for KV cache compression by learning attention patterns that preserve globally important information and approximate marginal token significance of larger models.

Result: SmallKV demonstrates improved performance in various benchmarks and achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: SmallKV successfully enhances the efficiency and performance of LLM inference by addressing KV cache eviction challenges, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over data privacy and compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA necessitate effective means to remove specific training data from machine learning models without affecting performance.

Method: The authors propose a conformal prediction-based framework with well-defined statistical guarantees and introduce metrics (ECF and EuCF) to quantify the unlearning effectiveness.

Result: The proposed method shows strong empirical performance in removing targeted data while maintaining uncertainty-aware guarantees across different datasets and models.

Conclusion: The approach improves upon existing MU techniques by offering rigorous unlearning metrics and enhanced practical applicability without requiring computationally intensive retraining.

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in current TSF methods, such as static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, to enhance intricate temporal dependency modeling.

Method: The paper proposes a novel framework that includes three key blocks: Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition (EMPD) for dynamic segmentation, Triad Interaction Block (TIB) for dependency modeling, and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE (ASR-MoE) for dynamic fusion, integrated into a multi-layer cascade architecture.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate the framework's consistent state-of-the-art performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the DMSC framework effectively addresses persistent challenges in TSF by integrating adaptive, dynamic, and multi-scale modeling techniques, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing divergences are primarily tailored for non-negative data, and the authors aim to generalize these divergences to complex data for broader applicability in signal processing.

Method: The authors propose an extended definition of alpha-beta divergences that accommodates complex vectors and derives closed-form expressions for optimizing an alpha-beta mean distortion.

Result: The framework reveals distinct roles of divergence hyperparameters and offers practical extensions of classical divergences while maintaining their separability.

Conclusion: The contributions of this novel formulation open up potential applications in signal processing domains involving complex data.

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

### [262] [Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt LLM Embedding for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02762)
*Dahun Kim,Anelia Angelova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach named Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding for vision-language contrastive learning to enhance semantic richness in text-visual alignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard models like CLIP that rely on a single text embedding for semantic representation, which may overlook diverse semantic aspects.

Method: The paper proposes the use of multiple structured prompts with adaptive tokens, processed together to form a unified text representation. It also introduces diversity regularization and negation-aware loss to encourage semantic specialization and contrastive discrimination.

Result: The proposed method shows consistent improvements on image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in enhancing semantic alignments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that employing multi-prompt embeddings and regularization techniques can significantly improve the semantic richness and alignment quality in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

### [263] [On the (In)Significance of Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03593)
*Bhavesh Neekhra,Debayan Gupta,Partha Pratim Chakravarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares performance of feature selection (FS) algorithms with randomly selected features in high-dimensional datasets and finds FS often unnecessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the widely-held belief that FS algorithms improve classification tasks in high-dimensional datasets, particularly in computational genomics.

Method: Testing the null hypothesis by comparing models trained on small random subsets of features with models trained on features selected via FS algorithms.

Result: Models trained on randomly selected small subsets of features perform similarly or better compared to those trained on features selected by FS algorithms.

Conclusion: This work questions current FS practices, especially in computational genomics, and highlights the need for further validation beyond purely computational methods, such as laboratory experiments.

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

*Farzad Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new geometric quantity, the Pair Correlation Factor (PCF), as a better indicator for learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) compared to the traditional minimum pairwise separation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work linked the sample complexity of learning GMMs to the minimum pairwise separation between components, but this perspective was found incomplete. The paper introduces PCF to better capture the clustering of component means.

Method: The authors analyzed the role of PCF in dictating the difficulty of parameter recovery for GMMs. They focused on the uniform spherical case to improve sample complexity bounds using PCF.

Result: Using PCF, the authors provided improved sample complexity bounds for learning GMMs, showing cases where more than $
\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are required.

Conclusion: The PCF is a more accurate indicator of sample complexity for learning GMMs than minimum pairwise separation, especially in cases of uniform spherical setups.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

### [266] [Uncertainty Sets for Distributionally Robust Bandits Using Structural Equation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02812)
*Katherine Avery,Chinmay Pendse,David Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for more accurate distributionally robust evaluation and learning using structural equation models (SEMs) and conditional independence testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for distributionally robust evaluation and learning are overly conservative, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications.

Method: The authors propose a bandit evaluation and learning algorithm that uses structural equation models to tailor uncertainty sets and applies conditional independence testing to detect shifted variables.

Result: The SEM-based approach provides more accurate evaluations, learns lower-variance policies, and performs well under large shifts, achieving optimal policy learning when the model is well-specified.

Conclusion: Structural equation models offer a promising alternative for distributionally robust evaluations and learning, addressing the conservatism of existing methods and enabling effective policy optimization.

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

### [267] [On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833)
*Lei Pang,Ruinan Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes and builds upon the GRPO algorithm, proposing a new TIC GRPO method that offers better policy gradient estimation and includes theoretical convergence proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve and address the limitations in the GRPO algorithm by refining its estimation of policy gradients and ensuring better theoretical underpinnings.

Method: The researchers study GRPO's update rules, propose TIC GRPO which uses trajectory-level probability ratios, and analyze its theoretical convergence alongside the original GRPO.

Result: The ablation study demonstrated that importance sampling removal had minimal performance impact. TIC GRPO simplified the update process while yielding unbiased policy gradient estimates comparable with GRPO.

Conclusion: TIC GRPO is a robust extension of GRPO, improving gradient estimation and retaining critic-free benefits while being supported by theoretical analysis of convergence.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

*Zewen Yang,Dongfa Zhang,Xiaobing Dai,Fengyi Yu,Chi Zhang,Bingkun Huang,Hamid Sadeghian,Sami Haddadin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SkyGP, a framework to improve Gaussian Processes for streaming data by overcoming computational and memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability challenge of Gaussian Processes in real-time applications requiring rapid adaptation and calibrated uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors develop SkyGP, a bounded expert framework with two variants (SkyGP-Dense for prediction accuracy and SkyGP-Fast for computational efficiency).

Result: SkyGP delivers improved performance, validated through benchmarks and real-time control experiments, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SkyGP represents an efficient solution for Gaussian Processes in dynamic and safety-critical systems, balancing scalability and prediction quality.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically-inspired framework leveraging adaptive, physics-based meta-learning with specialized experts for personalized antibody design, showing significant results in multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for adaptive antibody design strategies that cater to the unique requirements of different antigens, inspired by natural B cell affinity maturation.

Method: The method introduces a biologically-motivated system using physics-based expert modules (e.g., van der Waals, molecular recognition) with adaptive parameter evolution and SE(3)-equivariant guidance for iterative refinement.

Result: The approach enhances hotspot coverage, interface quality, and adapts optimization strategies for varying antigen classes, without pre-training, while preserving molecular symmetries.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential for advancing therapeutic antibody design by providing a generalized yet precise system for optimizing antibody-antigen interactions through iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

*Kennedy Edemacu,Vinay M. Shashidhar,Micheal Tuape,Dan Abudu,Beakcheol Jang,Jong Wook Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to knowledge poisoning attacks by proposing novel defense methods that effectively mitigate such threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of RAG systems to adversarial attacks, particularly PoisonedRAG, and ensure reliable model outputs when external knowledge is incorporated.

Method: The authors introduce two defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, designed to differentiate and filter adversarial texts from clean texts in the external knowledge source by leveraging a newly defined property.

Result: Evaluation using benchmark datasets highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving performance nearly equivalent to that of unaltered RAG systems.

Conclusion: FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG serve as robust defenses against knowledge poisoning attacks in RAG systems without significant performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a resource-efficient framework for cybersecurity vulnerability assessment combining particle swarm optimization for model architecture design and knowledge distillation for training, yielding a more compact and performant model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of software systems is creating more cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While large pre-trained models can address these issues, their high computational demands limit their real-world applications.

Method: The framework employs particle swarm optimization to design a compact student model's architecture and uses knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to the student model.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. It also outperforms baselines by 1.7% accuracy with 60% fewer parameters, and reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by 34.88%.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency and performance, making it scalable and viable for real-world cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tasks.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are explored for unsupervised fault detection in industrial processes, revealing high data efficiency and strong performance compared to Orthogonal Autoencoders (OAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in unsupervised fault detection, specifically in data-constrained industrial processes.

Method: KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) were tested with four variants and benchmarked against an Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) on synthetic fault detection tasks in chemical processes. Fault Detection Rate (FDR) was used as a metric.

Result: WavKAN-AE and EfficientKAN-AE demonstrated high fault detection rates ($\geq$92% and $\geq$90%, respectively) with minimal training samples. FastKAN-AE required larger datasets, while FourierKAN-AE performed poorly.

Conclusion: KAN-AEs outperform traditional models, offering efficiency and transparency for unsupervised fault detection in industrial settings with limited data.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

TL;DR: CauKer algorithm generates synthetic time series data using Gaussian Process (GP) and Structural Causal Models (SCM) for efficient pretraining of time series foundation models, overcoming computational limitations of real-world dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series foundation models require costly pretraining with large, real-world datasets; CauKer aims to address this by creating synthetic, diverse, realistic time series data efficiently.

Method: CauKer combines GP kernel composition with Structural Causal Models to generate causally coherent synthetic time series data with trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions for pretraining classification models.

Result: Synthetic datasets generated by CauKer exhibit consistent scaling laws across dataset sizes (10K to 10M samples) and model parameters (1M to 783M), offering reliable scaling behavior compared to irregularities in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CauKer provides a computationally efficient and effective approach to generating synthetic training data for time series models, addressing limitations in real-world data scaling and enabling better insights into dataset scaling laws.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

*Alex Massucco,Davide Murari,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified mathematical framework ensuring Jacobian matrices of neural networks are orthogonal almost everywhere, achieving stable training for very deep models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in training very deep neural networks and aim to improve stability and efficiency without relying solely on conventional architectures like skip connections.

Method: They propose a mathematical framework enforcing Jacobian orthogonality in nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, allowing for efficient training. They extend the analysis to generalized models with partial isometry properties.

Result: Perfect Jacobian orthogonality at initialization was shown experimentally to stabilize training and produce competitive performance. Regularization to maintain Jacobian orthogonality gave comparable results, and generalized models also retained favorable properties.

Conclusion: Prescribing Jacobian orthogonality or its approximations enables efficient training of deep networks, opening pathways to new architectures without the necessity for skip connections.

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs (PENODE) for improving Edge Digital Twins in Power Electronics Systems, achieving better accuracy and efficiency for edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for Power Electronics Systems struggle with capturing complex hybrid dynamics, leading to poor generalization and inefficiency, especially on edge devices.

Method: PENODE incorporates a hybrid event automaton and governing ODE components into a neural architecture for end-to-end training while ensuring physical interpretability and efficient FPGA deployment.

Result: Experimental benchmarks show PENODE improves accuracy and reduces neuron count by 75%, establishing better edge deployment and control performance across various modeling scenarios.

Conclusion: PENODE successfully offers a physically interpretable, efficient edge-deployable model that enhances real-time control and addresses existing modeling challenges for Power Electronics Systems.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

*Aakash Gore,Prasanna Chaporkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Clus-UCB, an algorithm for stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with known clustering, improving regret bounds and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model scenarios where outcomes depend on multiple factors with varied significance (e.g., advertising, trials, communications) using known clustering in multi-armed bandit problems.

Method: The paper develops the Clus-UCB algorithm, leveraging clustering information to allow arms within the same cluster to share information using a novel arm index.

Result: Clus-UCB achieves asymptotically close performance to the derived regret lower bounds and outperforms existing bandit algorithms in simulations.

Conclusion: The clustering structure enables improved regret bounds and efficient strategies, though limitations are acknowledged, and future research directions are proposed.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general-purpose pretrained neural network model for predicting fuel consumption and trajectory reachability in low-thrust space missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability to predict fuel consumption and trajectory reachability in low-thrust missions by addressing limitations in generalization, scalability, and computational efficiency.

Method: Constructed the largest dataset using the proposed homotopy ray method aligned with mission requirements, transformed data into a self-similar space, and trained neural networks capable of generalizing across diverse mission scenarios.

Result: Achieved high predictive accuracy with a relative error of 0.78% for velocity increments and 0.63% for minimum transfer time, validated across various datasets and scenarios.

Conclusion: The developed pretrained neural networks serve as the most general and accurate approximator for low-thrust trajectory design, offering broad applicability and high efficiency for mission analysis.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

### [278] [Training Long-Context, Multi-Turn Software Engineering Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03501)
*Alexander Golubev,Maria Trofimova,Sergei Polezhaev,Ibragim Badertdinov,Maksim Nekrashevich,Anton Shevtsov,Simon Karasik,Sergey Abramov,Andrei Andriushchenko,Filipp Fisin,Sergei Skvortsov,Boris Yangel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a modified algorithm to improve the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn software engineering tasks, achieving significant success improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL has been applied to LLMs for single-turn tasks, real-world challenges like software engineering require multi-turn interaction with stateful feedback environments. The paper seeks to address this deficiency.

Method: A modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm was employed to train a Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-based agent for solving software engineering problems.

Result: The proposed model elevated the success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from 20% to 39%, surpassing other leading open-weight models on SWE-rebench.

Conclusion: The research presents a promising approach for solving complex real-world problems using RL-enhanced LLMs, particularly in multi-turn applications within software engineering domains.

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

*Arthur Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GrandJury, a protocol for evaluating generative models through pluralistic, dynamic, and traceable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for generative machine learning models focus on static benchmarks, neglecting dynamic, user-centered needs and evolving content.

Method: The proposed GrandJury protocol incorporates time-decayed aggregation, transparent task rubrics, traceability of outputs, and multi-rater human judgment.

Result: GrandJury demonstrates how pluralistic and accountable evaluation can capture evolving consensus and highlight disagreements in generative model outputs.

Conclusion: GrandJury shifts the paradigm in generative model evaluation, emphasizing dynamic and context-sensitive methods over static benchmarks for more effective alignment with real-world use cases.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

### [280] [PLoRA: Efficient LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02932)
*Minghao Yan,Zhuang Wang,Zhen Jia,Shivaram Venkataraman,Yida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLoRA, a method that optimizes and accelerates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly reducing training time and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA fine-tuning methods for LLMs suffer from inefficiencies, such as hardware underutilization and high overhead, prompting the need for a solution that improves resource usage and performance.

Method: The authors propose PLoRA, which systematically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs while optimizing hardware usage. They also design efficient computational kernels tailored to these processes.

Result: PLoRA achieves up to 7.52x reduction in fine-tuning makespan and enhances training throughput by up to 12.8x across various state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: PLoRA effectively addresses existing inefficiencies in LoRA fine-tuning by optimizing concurrent training processes, achieving significant gains in both time and performance.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

*Zain Ulabedeen Farhat,Debamita Ghosh,George K. Atia,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online learning method for Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs), aiming to enhance resilience in multi-agent systems by optimizing worst-case performance against environmental uncertainties, without relying on prior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems often fail in real-world scenarios due to mismatches between training and deployment environments caused by uncertainties like noise or adversarial attacks. Current methods requiring simulators or offline datasets are impractical in many cases.

Method: The study introduces the "Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration" (RONAVI) algorithm, which allows agents to learn directly from environmental interactions. It incorporates theoretical guarantees to ensure low regret and efficient discovery of robust policies under specific uncertainty measures.

Result: The theoretical analysis shows that the RONAVI algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently determines robust optimal policies for uncertainty sets based on Total Variation and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Conclusion: This work sets a practical foundation for developing truly robust multi-agent systems by enabling direct interaction-based learning under environmental uncertainties without dependence on prior data.

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

*Jonathan Patsenker,Henry Li,Myeongseob Ko,Ruoxi Jia,Yuval Kluger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight method to improve diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers by estimating the conditional posterior mean, resulting in faster and more memory-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for inverse problems rely heavily on Tweedie's formula, which does not integrate measurement data effectively during the sampling process, limiting their robustness and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose estimating the conditional posterior mean by solving a single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation problem, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing sampling algorithms.

Result: The proposed method yields results that are comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art inverse solvers across diverse datasets and tasks, with added benefits of speed and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the capabilities of diffusion models in solving inverse problems by effectively incorporating measurement information and provides a robust solution for noise-affected data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable clustering method for high-dimensional data using label propagation in density-adaptive neighborhood graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering high-dimensional data with varied density is computationally intensive and requires effective methods to handle such challenges.

Method: The authors propose a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm combined with random projection techniques to build approximate neighborhood graphs more efficiently.

Result: Their approach scales to datasets with millions of data points within minutes and matches the accuracy of existing clustering methods.

Conclusion: The method bridges density-based clustering with graph connectivity, offering a scalable and accurate clustering solution for high-dimensional data.

Abstract: We propose a novel perspective on varied-density clustering for
high-dimensional data by framing it as a label propagation process in
neighborhood graphs that adapt to local density variations. Our method formally
connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of
efficient graph propagation techniques developed in network science. To ensure
scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to
existing baselines.

*Jiahui Bai,Hai Dong,A. K. Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFedCAD introduces a centroid-aligned distillation method to tackle issues in decentralized federated learning (DFL), achieving high accuracy and substantial reduction in communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limiting factors in DFL include the slow performance of late-joining clients and high communication costs in asynchronous setups, which impact scalability and efficiency.

Method: DFedCAD compresses model data through Weighted Cluster Pruning (WCP) and uses a k-means distillation mechanism guided by structural metrics to allow delayed clients to align and integrate knowledge efficiently.

Result: In experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, DFedCAD demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and reduced communication overhead by over 86%.

Conclusion: DFedCAD offers a practical, scalable framework for decentralized learning, excelling in dynamic environments with improved efficiency and reduced communication demands.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

### [285] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Shapley-based Mixed Precision Quantization (SMPQ), addressing the shortcomings of gradient-based methods for bit-width selection in neural networks and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume that gradient-based bit-width selection reflects their contribution to task accuracy. The authors identify that this assumption is flawed.

Method: SMPQ measures the direct contribution of each bit-width using Shapley values, coupled with Monte Carlo approximation to improve efficiency.

Result: SMPQ outperforms gradient-based mixed precision quantization methods consistently across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more accurate and computationally efficient way to optimize bit-width allocation, setting a new standard in MPQ performance.

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

*Ruixing Zhang,Bo Wang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a one-stage approach to urban profiling by unifying pretraining and inference through a masked autoencoding process, outperforming traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban profiling methods rely on a two-stage process (representation learning followed by prediction) and are limited by task-specific fine-tuning requirements.

Method: The authors propose Urban In-Context Learning, combining pretraining and inference via masked autoencoding, supported by the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer and Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism.

Result: Experiments across multiple indicators in two cities show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness via ablation and case studies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the advantages of unifying pretraining and inference in urban profiling, particularly through the use of diffusion modeling, enabling broader applications and eliminating fine-tuning.

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

*Tatwadarshi P Nagarhalli,Sanket Patil,Vishal Pande,Uday Aswalekar,Prafulla Patil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal framework for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers combined with deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-modality diagnostic methods fail to capture the multifaceted complexity of Alzheimer's Disease, leading to delays in treatment and poorer outcomes.

Method: The framework integrates data from MRI, cognitive tests, and biomarkers, analyzed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for MRI and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for other modalities, with weighted averaging for data aggregation.

Result: The multimodal system shows enhanced diagnostic accuracy and reliability, even with incomplete datasets, enabling early identification and intervention for AD.

Conclusion: This study highlights the framework's potential to improve robustness in AD detection, allowing for earlier diagnosis and intervention, which could significantly impact disease management.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: This work introduces VRPO, a value-focused framework, to address noisy supervision challenges in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by enhancing the reliability of advantage estimations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of noisy reward supervision in RLHF, which undermines policy stability and accurate generalization, emphasizing the importance of improving the value model.

Method: The proposed VRPO framework includes a value model enhanced through two mechanisms: an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and a variational information bottleneck aimed at mitigating noise.

Result: Experiments on tasks like math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue under noisy rewards show that VRPO outperforms existing baselines such as PPO and GRPO consistently.

Conclusion: The study highlights the often-overlooked critical role of the value model in RLHF and demonstrates that VRPO provides a practical and principled method for robust policy optimization in noisy environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

### [289] [HiTeC: Hierarchical Contrastive Learning on Text-Attributed Hypergraph with Semantic-Aware Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03104)
*Mengting Pan,Fan Li,Xiaoyang Wang,Wenjie Zhang,Xuemin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework, designed to address limitations in self-supervised learning of text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs). It focuses on improving scalability and representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing contrastive learning methods for TAHGs, which neglect textual information, rely on noisy augmentations, and fail to capture long-range dependencies effectively.

Method: HiTeC utilizes a two-stage approach: first, it pre-trains a text encoder with structure-aware contrastive objectives. Second, it applies semantic-aware augmentations, such as prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, complemented by a multi-scale contrastive loss.

Result: The proposed framework effectively addresses the key limitations of existing approaches and enhances both scalability and representation quality. Experimental results validate its performance.

Conclusion: HiTeC demonstrates a scalable and effective solution for self-supervised learning on TAHGs, offering improved node representation and long-range dependency modeling.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

*Yuichi Kondo,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Lyapunov function to analyze and optimize stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules. It identifies strategies (constant/increasing batch size with decaying/increasing learning rates) and ranks their convergence efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenging convergence analysis of SGDM used in deep learning and to provide unified insights and guidance on dynamic learning rate and batch size scheduling strategies.

Method: The authors developed a simplified Lyapunov function for analyzing SGDM under three dynamic scheduling frameworks. They theoretically and empirically evaluated the efficiency and convergence behavior of these strategies.

Result: The findings show that increasing batch size with an increasing learning rate achieves faster convergence compared to other strategies. Empirical results validate the theoretical acceleration and demonstrate that dynamic scheduling outperforms static approaches.

Conclusion: The study offers unified theoretical insights and practical recommendations for designing efficient SGDM training schedules, proving their superiority over fixed hyperparameter methods in terms of convergence and stability.

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

*Tarhib Al Azad,Faizul Rakib Sayem,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses OOD detection using a pseudo-label-induced subspace representation, introducing a novel learning criterion to enhance separability between ID and OOD samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely on restrictive assumptions that limit separability between ID and OOD samples in feature spaces.

Method: The authors propose a framework using pseudo-label-induced subspace representation with a learning criterion combining cross-entropy-based classification and subspace distance regularization.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving better ID-OOD separability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework leverages relaxed assumptions to improve OOD detection, offering a more robust solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

### [292] [GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111)
*Francesco Leonardi,Markus Orsi,Jean-Louis Reymond,Kaspar Riesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for approximating Graph Edit Distance (GED) that incorporates both supervised and unsupervised training while using a flexible, interpretable cost model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the limitations of existing methods for GED computation, specifically the assumption of unit-cost edit operations, which is unrealistic for real-world problems.

Method: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network framework leveraging supervised and unsupervised training. It incorporates a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism for unsupervised optimization without ground-truth distances, and employs a Generalized Additive Model for learning context-aware edit costs.

Result: The proposed method performs comparably to state-of-the-art models but offers improved adaptability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach enhances understanding of complex graph structures and is beneficial in applications like molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

### [293] [RegMean++: Enhancing Effectiveness and Generalization of Regression Mean for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03121)
*The-Hai Nguyen,Dang Huu-Tien,Takeshi Suzuki,Le-Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegMean++ improves on the RegMean model merging method by considering both intra- and cross-layer dependencies, resulting in better prediction performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RegMean provides a computationally efficient and explainable model merging technique, its limitation lies in treating each layer independently, thereby ignoring dependencies across layers that affect the merged model's predictions.

Method: RegMean++ modifies the RegMean approach by incorporating intra- and cross-layer dependencies in the objective function, aiming for a more comprehensive modeling of interactions within the merged model.

Result: RegMean++ delivers consistent improvements over RegMean and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results in ID/OOD generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness against distribution shifts.

Conclusion: By addressing the layer dependency limitations in RegMean, RegMean++ achieves a more accurate and robust model merging solution, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of scenarios.

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

### [294] [Estimating Worst-Case Frontier Risks of Open-Weight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03153)
*Eric Wallace,Olivia Watkins,Miles Wang,Kai Chen,Chris Koch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines worst-case risks of releasing gpt-oss by maliciously fine-tuning it for high-risk tasks in biology and cybersecurity. Results show limited additional risk, leading to the release of the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess the potential risks associated with the release of open-source large language models (LLMs) by simulating maximum harm scenarios in critical domains.

Method: They employ malicious fine-tuning (MFT) to enhance GPT-OSS's capabilities in biology (biorisk tasks in an RL environment) and cybersecurity (CTF problem-solving in agentic coding). Both frontier open- and closed-weight LLMs serve as comparisons.

Result: MFT GPT-OSS underperformed compared to frontier closed-weight LLMs (OpenAI o3) and showed only marginal improvements over other open-weight models in terms of risk amplification.

Conclusion: The findings suggest limited risk elevation, justifying the release of GPT-OSS. Furthermore, their methods highlight a framework to estimate harms in future open-weight LLMs releases.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

*Paul Gümmer,Julian Rosenberger,Mathias Kraus,Patrick Zschech,Nico Hambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method employing two-stage clustering to enhance house price valuation, demonstrating significant accuracy and interpretability improvements over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: House price valuation poses challenges due to market heterogeneity and limited interpretability in existing models.

Method: The approach applies two-stage clustering based on geographical features, followed by modeling clusters with either linear regression or generalized additive models to balance accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Using a dataset of 43,309 German property listings, the models showed a 36% improvement (GAM) and 58% improvement (LR) in mean absolute error compared to unclustered models.

Conclusion: The paper showcases the value of cluster-specific modeling, improving property valuations through enhanced accuracy and interpretability, with practical benefits for market stakeholders.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

### [296] [Rethinking Selectivity in State Space Models: A Minimal Predictive Sufficiency Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03158)
*Yiyi Wang,Jian'an Zhang,Hongyi Duan,Haoyang Liu,Qingyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), which uses an information-theoretic principle for sequence modeling to improve performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State Space Models often rely on heuristically designed mechanisms without theoretical grounding, risking suboptimality and robustness issues.

Method: The authors develop the MPS-SSM framework guided by the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, which uses an objective function to optimize minimal sufficient statistics of past data for future prediction.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets reveal that MPS-SSM achieves superior performance and robustness in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The MPS principle not only enhances the performance of SSMs but also serves as a general regularization framework applicable to other architectures, demonstrating its versatility.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

### [297] [CoTox: Chain-of-Thought-Based Molecular Toxicity Reasoning and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03159)
*Jueon Park,Yein Park,Minju Song,Soyon Park,Donghyeon Lee,Seungheun Baek,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoTox, a framework combining large language models (LLMs) and chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable, multi-toxicity prediction in drug development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many machine learning models for drug toxicity prediction are hindered by their reliance on annotated data, lack of biological interpretability, and inability to handle organ-specific toxicities.

Method: CoTox integrates LLMs with chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology terms to predict toxicity through a reasoning-based framework. It leverages GPT-4o and represents chemical structures using IUPAC names for enhanced comprehension.

Result: CoTox outperformed traditional machine learning and deep learning methods, demonstrated superior multi-toxicity prediction, and aligned its outputs with physiological responses in case studies.

Conclusion: LLM-based frameworks like CoTox show promise in improving drug safety assessment by increasing interpretability and predictive accuracy. Its practical utility is demonstrated through simulated biological contexts, and its resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

*Lasse Bohlen,Sven Kruschel,Julian Rosenberger,Patrick Zschech,Mathias Kraus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study replicates prior research on reducing aversion to algorithmic decisions via user-adjustable predictions and extends it by integrating interpretability in ML models. Transparency's role was less impactful than anticipated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how allowing users to adjust ML predictions and introducing interpretable decision logic can address aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.

Method: A pre-registered user study with 280 participants was conducted, replicating prior studies on adjustability and extending them with ML model transparency.

Result: Replicated previous findings that adjustable predictions reduce algorithmic aversion. Transparency had a smaller-than-expected effect and appeared independent from adjustability's impact.

Conclusion: Adjustability remains effective at reducing algorithm aversion. Transparency alone showed limited impact, and its effects were more independent than synergistic with adjustability.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning architecture using quantum spectral methods for interpretable signal analysis and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional neural networks and create an interpretable, data-efficient, and physically informed model.

Method: Uses quantum spectral methods like Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm for sparse spectral representations, combined with a kernel projection for rule-based reasoning.

Result: Demonstrated competitive accuracy on tasks like anomaly detection and symbolic classification, with higher interpretability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture offers a viable alternative to black-box models by blending mathematical physics, sparse approximation, and symbolic AI, paving the way for reasoning-capable, interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

### [300] [Adaptive Sparse Softmax: An Effective and Efficient Softmax Variant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03175)
*Qi Lv,Lei Geng,Ziqiang Cao,Min Cao,Sujian Li,Wenjie Li,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Sparse Softmax (AS-Softmax), a method that addresses inefficiencies in standard softmax with cross-entropy loss by focusing learning on harder classification challenges and speeding up training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax with cross-entropy loss leads to inefficiencies such as unnecessary prolonged training and overfitting, as it continuously trains on all samples, even easy ones, while never reaching a perfect target score of 1.

Method: The authors propose AS-Softmax, which selectively discards far smaller scores during training to focus on distinguishing the target class from strong opponents, and introduces an adaptive gradient accumulation strategy to speed up training by reducing the impact of easy samples.

Result: AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants across multiple classification tasks with varying class sizes, and improves training speed by about 1.2 times while maintaining classification effectiveness.

Conclusion: AS-Softmax offers a more efficient and effective alternative to standard softmax by addressing its limitations through targeted learning and adaptive gradient accumulation, proving its capability in a wide range of classification tasks.

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

*Yi Ma,Hongyao Tang,Chenjun Xiao,Yaodong Yang,Wei Wei,Jianye Hao,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews how scaling laws can enhance deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by analyzing strategies in data, networks, and training budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in deep learning, especially in computer vision and NLP, have been facilitated by scaling laws. However, the application of these laws in DRL remains underutilized despite its potential.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes scaling strategies across three dimensions: data, networks, and training budget, assessing their effects on DRL performance.

Result: The systematic analysis highlights how these scaling strategies can synergistically improve DRL, offering insights for future research and development.

Conclusion: Balancing scalability with computational efficiency is key to realizing DRL's potential, and the roadmap provided emphasizes scalability in tasks like robotics, autonomous driving, and LLM training.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

TL;DR: The paper examines how correlations evolve across layers in finite-width neural networks, finding a fractal structure at the boundary of ordered and chaotic regimes, applicable to both MLPs and CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between infinite-width theoretical models and practical finite-size networks in understanding neural network dynamics.

Method: The authors use an analysis of information propagation in randomly initialized finite-width neural networks and extend this study to CNNs using Fourier-based structured transforms.

Result: Revealed a fractal structure in the ordered-chaotic boundary, showing it applies to both fully connected and convolutional neural networks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the complexity of finite-width networks and stresses the crucial role of depth in balancing separation and robustness in network behavior.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALO introduces a bidding system leveraging hindsight learning and B-spline representation to handle diverse advertiser constraints and improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advertisers in real-time bidding systems have varied budgets and ROI targets, creating challenges for multi-constraint bidding systems. Traditional methods lack sample efficiency and fail to generalize effectively.

Method: HALO incorporates hindsight learning to repurpose explorations into usable training data, coupled with B-spline representation for continuous and derivative-aware bid mapping.

Result: Evaluations on industrial datasets show that HALO effectively reduces constraint violations and increases Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).

Conclusion: HALO is a robust, adaptive solution for addressing the operational challenges of diverse constraints in real-time auto-bidding systems.

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic framework for time series classification that emphasizes both accuracy and interpretability by embedding raw time series data into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study addresses the problem of interpretability in time series classification, which is critical in safety-related applications, as current deep learning methods lack transparent explanations.

Method: A neuro-symbolic model is proposed that incorporates a novel STL-inspired kernel to map raw time series into STL formulae, facilitating joint optimization for both classification accuracy and interpretability.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive classification performance while providing robust, high-quality logical explanations for model predictions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability in time series classification, offering human-understandable explanations for both local and global predictions.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether the performance of Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph Embedding (HKGE) models stems from their core model or additional modules, proposes decomposition methods, identifies shortcomings in HKGE models, and introduces the FormerGNN framework to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the key factors driving the performance of HKGE models compared to classical KGE models and address their limitations in capturing graph dependencies and integrating information effectively.

Method: The study converts HKGs to KGs for performance evaluation, analyzes decomposition effects on topology and information preservation, and introduces FormerGNN with a qualifier integrator and GNN-based graph encoder for better performance.

Result: Findings show classical KGE models can sometimes match HKGE models' performance, decomposition methods degrade HKG topology, and the proposed FormerGNN framework significantly outperforms existing HKGE models.

Conclusion: HKGE models have limitations in dependency capture and information integration. The FormerGNN framework addresses these challenges effectively, offering a promising direction for future HKGE research.

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on Continual Learning for graphs often neglects the streaming setting required for real-world evolving graphs, where online and timely predictions are crucial.

Method: The paper provides a general formulation for OCL on graphs, emphasizes efficiency in batch processing over graph topology, and introduces benchmarks for model evaluation.

Result: The authors report the performance of several Continual Learning methods adapted to their proposed OCL-on-graphs setting.

Conclusion: This work establishes a clearer definition and practical framework for Online Continual Learning on graphs, enabling systematic research and comparison in this area.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

### [307] [Strategic Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03289)
*Safwan Hossain,Yatong Chen,Yiling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to explore hypothesis testing in a principal-agent framework and provides empirical validation using drug approval data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic interactions impact hypothesis testing and decision-making in a principal-agent context, especially in scenarios like drug approvals.

Method: Developing a game-theoretic model to analyze interactions and optimize the principal's p-value threshold for hypothesis testing.

Result: Identified a critical p-value threshold with monotonicity in the principal's errors, validated with publicly available drug approval data.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making and highlights optimal mechanisms for balancing errors in hypothesis testing.

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

*Svenja Ehlers,Merten Stender,Norbert Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework is developed for reconstructing nonlinear ocean wave fields in real-time from sparse data, without relying on ground truth datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields, which is obstructed by the lack of practical data assimilation methods and large labeled datasets in real-world scenarios.

Method: The study uses a PINO framework that incorporates physical constraints, by embedding residuals of free surface boundary conditions into its loss function. This approach does not need ground truth data for training.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs realistic nonlinear wave fields from sparse measurements like buoy time series and radar snapshots, while showing robust generalization across various wave conditions.

Conclusion: PINO-based frameworks offer a promising solution for real-time, data-driven wave reconstruction and prediction in realistic marine settings, eliminating the dependency on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

### [309] [Software Fairness Dilemma: Is Bias Mitigation a Zero-Sum Game?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03323)
*Zhenpeng Chen,Xinyue Li,Jie M. Zhang,Weisong Sun,Ying Xiao,Tianlin Li,Yiling Lou,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores fairness in ML for tabular data by analyzing bias mitigation methods. Contrary to prior findings, fairness here operates as a zero-sum trade-off, with benefits for unprivileged groups coming at the expense of privileged groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's confusion over whether bias mitigation for tabular data mirrors leveling-down effects observed in other domains like vision and NLP.

Method: Evaluating eight bias mitigation methods across 44 tasks, five datasets, and four ML models, with an additional focus on applying methods exclusively to unprivileged groups.

Result: Bias mitigation for tabular tasks generally operates as zero-sum: improving unprivileged group fairness correlates with less benefits for privileged groups.

Conclusion: A new approach targeting only unprivileged groups shows promise to achieve fairness without harm to privileged groups or overall ML performance, advancing fairness in tabular data.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

*He Xiao,Qingyao Yang,Dirui Xie,Wendong Xu,Wenyong Zhou,Haobo Liu,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LieQ is a post-training quantization framework for sub-7B language models that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under extreme low-bit compression, significantly outperforming competing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address memory and energy inefficiency of large language models during inference, especially under extreme compression, without compromising accuracy.

Method: Developed LieQ, a post-training quantization method relying on three layer-wise diagnostics: Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain, to allocate bit-width without requiring gradient updates.

Result: LieQ recovers 95.9% of FP16 performance at 2.05-bit quantization in Qwen3-4B and achieves 98.2% of baseline accuracy on LLaMA3.2-3B with 4x memory reduction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy-compression trade-offs.

Conclusion: LieQ sets a new standard for deploying small language models efficiently on resource-constrained devices through its innovative metric-driven quantization techniques.

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

*N. Marrani,T. Hageman,E. Martínez-Pañeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using multi-Neural Networks is proposed to predict hydrogen trapping parameters directly from TDS spectra, overcoming traditional limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting trap binding energies and densities from TDS spectra using an indirect method.

Method: The authors developed a machine learning model consisting of two neural networks: one for predicting the number of trap types and another for estimating densities and binding energies. The model was trained on synthetic data and optimized for limited training data.

Result: The model showed strong predictive performance when applied to experimental data from tempered martensitic steels.

Conclusion: The developed machine learning scheme offers an effective tool for extracting hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS spectra, and the code is freely available for further use.

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI on the Pulse integrates wearable sensors and advanced AI models to autonomously detect health risks in real-time, achieving robust performance across devices and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Build a practical, real-world anomaly detection system for personalized health monitoring using non-invasive devices.

Method: Convergence of wearable sensors, ambient intelligence, and the UniTS universal time-series model for anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods.

Result: Higher robustness in anomaly detection across devices with a 22% improvement in F1 score compared to 12 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The system successfully monitors patients in real-world contexts with non-invasive devices, providing meaningful clinical insights via LLM integration.

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

*Atabey Ünlü,Phil Rohr,Ahmet Celebi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses a multi-agent framework for automating molecular optimization in drug discovery, assessed using AKT1 protein binding. Results highlight trade-offs between optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug discovery is hindered by scattered data and tools, leading to slow molecular design cycles. The paper seeks to accelerate this process with automation and transparent reasoning paths.

Method: The framework uses agents (Principal Researcher, Database agent, AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking agent, Scientific Critic) to optimize molecules based on AKT1 protein and test different LLM-based configurations.

Result: Multi-agent setups improve binding affinity by 31%, while single-agent runs produce molecules with better drug-likeness. Unguided LLMs operate faster but lack reasoning transparency.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling, feedback loops, and provenance improve LLM-based molecular designs for drug discovery. Expanding toolsets could enhance workflows towards ADMET and selectivity predictions.

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

*Seraj Al Mahmud Mostafa,Aravind Mohan,Jianwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA-MORL is a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for adaptive GPU/CPU allocation in cloud ML workloads, optimizing for training time, cost, and SLA compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic resource allocation for ML workloads in cloud environments faces challenges in balancing training time, cost, and SLA compliance, which static or single-objective methods fail to adequately address.

Method: SLA-MORL incorporates intelligent initialization through historical learning or baselines to reduce cold starts and employs dynamic weight adaptation to prioritize SLA compliance in real time. It uses a 21-dimensional state representation and an actor-critic network for resource allocation across 9 action options.

Result: The evaluation on 13 ML workloads showed that SLA-MORL reduced training time by 67.2% for deadline-critical jobs, costs by 68.8% for budget-constrained jobs, and SLA violations by 73.4% compared to static baselines.

Conclusion: SLA-MORL provides an effective and adaptive resource management framework for ML operations in the cloud, optimizing performance, cost, and SLA compliance while overcoming cold-start inefficiencies and dynamic adaptation issues.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

*Mohammadreza Sadeghi,Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad,MirHamed Jafarzadeh Asl,Yu Gu,Yuanhao Yu,Masoud Asgharian,Vahid Partovi Nia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoKA, a novel fine-tuning method for reducing computational overhead in large language models (LLMs) while improving performance by employing a mixture of Kronecker adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods using low-rank adapters suffer from performance limitations on complex tasks due to rank constraints.

Method: Proposed a MoKA mechanism using a mixture of Kronecker products and gating functions for expressive and efficient adaptation. Reformulated computations for GPU compatibility.

Result: MoKA reduced trainable parameters by up to 27x and outperformed existing PEFT baselines in instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MoKA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between parameter efficiency and model performance, bringing significant advancement in PEFT for LLMs.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

### [316] [VRPRM: Process Reward Modeling via Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03556)
*Xinquan Chen,Bangwei Liu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes VRPRM, a visual reasoning-based process reward model, to improve reasoning in Large Language Models with lower data annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most process reward models (PRMs) lack long-term reasoning and deep thinking capabilities, and data annotation costs for advanced models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities are prohibitive.

Method: The authors introduced VRPRM, a visual reasoning approach, and employed a two-stage training strategy leveraging 3.6K CoT-PRM supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data and 50K non-CoT PRM reinforcement learning (RL) data.

Result: VRPRM outperformed a non-thinking PRM trained on 400K data, achieving a relative performance improvement of up to 118% in the BoN experiment.

Conclusion: Combining visual reasoning with a two-stage training strategy leads to enhanced reasoning capabilities and more efficient data utilization for process reward models.

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

*Weiyao Zhang,Jinyang Li,Qi Song,Miao Wang,Chungang Lin,Haitong Luo,Xuying Meng,Yujun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Horus, a Federated Learning (FL) framework using low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to combat poisoning attacks in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces significant vulnerability to poisoning attacks, especially in real-world scenarios with high heterogeneity in data distributions, communication, and models, which complicates attack detection and mitigation.

Method: The method involves using low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) on stable layers of models and aggregating only LoRAs instead of full models. A heterogeneity-oblivious poisoning score is proposed, leveraging stable features of input projections to filter poisoned clients. For benign updates, a projection-aware mechanism reweights updates for global consistency.

Result: The approach, Horus, achieves superior robustness and accuracy against poisoning attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, as validated across diverse datasets, models, and attack types.

Conclusion: Horus demonstrates a robust and accurate solution for tackling poisoning attacks in highly heterogeneous Federated Learning settings, effectively mitigating key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

*Yuhan Guo,Lizhong Ding,Shihan Jia,Yanyu Ren,Pengqi Li,Jiarun Fu,Changsheng Li,Ye yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepFaith, a unified explanation framework for Explainable AI (XAI) that ensures optimal faithfulness in model explanations across multiple metrics and demonstrates high performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the absence of a ground truth for evaluating and optimizing explainability methods in XAI, which hampers trust and usability in complex systems.

Method: The authors propose the DeepFaith framework, which unifies multiple faithfulness metrics, derives an optimal explanation objective, and uses a learning framework optimizing pattern consistency and local correlation. The explainer is trained with high-quality signals filtered for redundancy and generates explanations without accessing the model being explained.

Result: On 12 diverse tasks across 6 models and datasets, DeepFaith achieved the highest faithfulness among 10 metrics, outperforming baseline methods and proving its efficacy and generalizability.

Conclusion: DeepFaith provides a theoretical ground truth to explanation methods in XAI, achieving notable cross-domain effectiveness and improving trust in complex systems through optimal faithfulness in model explanation.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

### [319] [Zero-Variance Gradients for Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03587)
*Zilei Shao,Anji Liu,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Silent Gradients,' a new training approach for Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that bypasses stochastic gradient estimation to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training VAEs often suffers from the high estimation variance introduced by stochastic gradient computation, slowing convergence and degrading model performance.

Method: The paper proposes using an architecture-specific decoder design to analytically compute the ELBO expected gradient, yielding zero variance, and introduces a dynamic training strategy combining this analytical approach with traditional stochastic methods.

Result: Experiments show that 'Silent Gradients' consistently enhance VAE training performance compared to standard methods like reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising new way to train generative models, merging the stability of analytical computation with the complexity of deep, expressive architectures.

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

*Adib Hasan,Mardavij Roozbehani,Munther Dahleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VITA, a novel AI framework that improves crop yield predictions, especially under extreme weather conditions, by addressing asymmetric data issues through domain-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle to accurately forecast crop yields, particularly when yields deviate from historical trends due to limited fine-tuning data and data asymmetry.

Method: VITA employs a variational pretraining approach using detailed weather variables as proxy targets and self-supervised feature masking. It allows effective fine-tuning with only basic weather statistics during deployment.

Result: VITA demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in forecasting corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. It showed statistically significant improvements particularly in extreme weather scenarios ($p \approx 0.01$).

Conclusion: VITA proves to be a practical and efficient solution for agricultural forecasting, outperforming prior models with less data and showcasing the importance of domain-aware AI to handle data limitations and climate challenges.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarSeer introduces a fast and accurate AI model for 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting, surpassing traditional models in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate solar irradiance forecasting to ensure efficient operation and support for net-zero energy systems, while addressing the limitations of computational cost and complexity in traditional NWP models.

Method: Developed an AI model that utilizes historical satellite observations to generate forecasts without the computational cost of data assimilation or solving complex PDEs.

Result: SolarSeer operates over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWPs, achieves 27.28% error reduction in reanalysis data, and 15.35% error reduction across 1,800 stations, outperforming HRRR.

Conclusion: By combining speed and accuracy, SolarSeer offers a transformative tool that supports sustainable energy transition through its enhanced solar irradiance forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

### [322] [Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03663)
*Deepak Pandita,Flip Korn,Chris Welty,Christopher M. Homan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the optimal balance between the number of data items and annotations per item needed for reliable machine learning evaluations, acknowledging human disagreement in annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validation in scientific research often hinges on reproducibility, which builds trust in results. In machine learning, human annotations often serve as ground truth, yet disagreement among annotators is often ignored, potentially skewing evaluations.

Method: The authors analyze multiple categorical datasets containing several annotations per item and conduct simulations to determine the ideal trade-offs in allocating budget across the number of items (N) and responses per item (K).

Result: The study finds that reliable evaluation can be achieved with total $N \times K$ values at or below 1000 across datasets. Metrics responsive to annotation disagreement perform better when $K > 10$, depending on the metrics used.

Conclusion: Ignoring human disagreement in ML evaluations can lead to flawed results. This paper provides methods to optimize the number of annotations and evaluation metrics to improve reliability within budget constraints.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of Goedel-Prover-V2 series of language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in automated theorem proving and outperforming previous models despite having a smaller size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a superior open-source language model for automated theorem proving that is efficient and delivers high accuracy, even with smaller model size and compute budget.

Method: Utilizes expert iteration and reinforcement learning with innovations in scaffolded data synthesis, verifier-guided self-correction, and model averaging.

Result: The smaller Goedel-Prover-V2-8B model achieved 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F, outperforming a much larger model, while the flagship Goedel-Prover-V2-32B model reached 88.1% pass@32 and solved 86 problems on PutnamBench, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2 establishes itself as the strongest open-source model for theorem proving, showcasing superior performance with minimal size and compute requirements while releasing models, data, and code for community use.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at
https://github.com/Goedel-LM/Goedel-Prover-V2.

### [324] [Cross-patient Seizure Onset Zone Classification by Patient-Dependent Weight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03635)
*Xuyang Zhao,Hidenori Sugano,Toshihisa Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the "cross-patient problem" in identifying seizure onset zones (SOZ) for focal epilepsy patients using machine learning by introducing a fine-tuning method based on patient-specific weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge in SOZ identification for focal epilepsy patients, as current methods rely heavily on expert judgment and machine learning models struggle with performance inconsistencies across patients due to data distribution differences.

Method: The proposed method involves pretraining a supervised machine learning model, determining patient-specific weights based on data similarity, and fine-tuning the model using these weights and training data. Performance is evaluated using a leave-one-patient-out approach.

Result: The experimental results indicate that the method improves classification accuracy by over 10% on average for every test patient.

Conclusion: The patient-specific fine-tuning approach effectively addresses the cross-patient variability in medical data, enhancing the model's diagnostic reliability for focal epilepsy patients.

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how structural constraints affect the compatibility of internal representations learned by deep neural networks across different architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address questions about the stability, alignment, and transferability of learned structures in deep neural networks despite architectural variations.

Method: The paper develops a framework employing structured transformations, corrective paths, and a combination of theoretical, empirical, and transfer experiments to analyze representational alignment.

Result: Structural regularities lead to internal representations that are more stable under architectural variations, enhancing interoperability of features across models.

Conclusion: Inductive biases not only aid generalization within models but also improve representation transferability, advancing robust learning systems, model distillation, and modular learning.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

*Michael Przystupa,Hongyao Tang,Martin Jagersand,Santiago Miret,Mariano Phielipp,Matthew E. Taylor,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores a combination of morphology-aware policy pretraining and parameter-efficient finetuning methods to enhance robotic policy performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in morphology-aware policies, specifically their sub-optimal zero-shot performance, which impacts efficiency and practicality in robotic applications.

Method: Combine morphology-aware policy pretraining with parameter-efficient finetuning approaches (e.g., subset weight tuning, learnable adapters, prefix tuning) and compare their effects.

Result: PEFT techniques used alongside policy pretraining showed significant sample efficiency improvement and required less than 1% of tunable parameters for performance enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed combination highlights a promising pathway to reduce learnable parameters and improve policy efficiency in adaptable robotic systems.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

*Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contract layer for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Design by Contract (DbC) and type theory to ensure compliance with semantic and type requirements in their inputs and outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate outputs that are fluent but often lack guarantees of correctness. This paper aims to enforce output validity and reliability using formal methods.

Method: A contract layer is designed to mediate LLM calls, imposing type and semantic requirements on inputs and outputs with probabilistic remediation to ensure compliance.

Result: The use of contracts provides a framework where semantic validation is operationally defined, enabling the probabilistic satisfaction of semantic and type requirements.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel approach to treat LLMs as semantic parsers and black-box components, highlighting functional equivalence between agents satisfying the same contracts.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

TL;DR: The study proposes a self-play framework where language models improve by generating and solving their own questions without needing external labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether pre-trained large language models can enhance their reasoning abilities without external data, leveraging self-generated questions and answers.

Method: Proposes the Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM) framework, in which a proposer generates questions or unit tests, and a solver addresses them, both being refined using reinforcement learning with rewards for appropriate problem difficulty and correctness.

Result: Demonstrates the SQLM framework's effectiveness on benchmarks like three-digit multiplication, the OMEGA algebra problems, and coding challenges, showing language models improve without curated datasets.

Conclusion: Language models can self-improve reasoning and problem-solving abilities through self-questioning and reinforcement learning, eliminating dependency on curated external data.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsolved problem by LLMs despite favorable conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception that LLMs excel at solving sophisticated mathematical problems.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on Yu Tsumura's 554th problem under controlled criteria.

Result: Existing LLMs failed to solve the problem despite it meeting favorable conditions for solvability.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in mathematical problem-solving, even under ideal conditions.

Abstract: We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities,
fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that a problem exists --
Yu Tsumura's 554th problem -- that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in
terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has
caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard
IMO problems, d) has a publicly available solution (likely in the training data
of LLMs), and e) that cannot be readily solved by any existing off-the-shelf
LLM (commercial or open-source).

*Ondrej Bajgar,Dewi S. W. Gould,Jonathon Liu,Alessandro Abate,Konstantinos Gatsis,Michael A. Osborne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAC-EIG, an active inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, that provides formal guarantees on policy reliability by strategically selecting human demonstrations, especially in safety-critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous AI systems must reliably align to human preferences, especially in high-stakes settings (e.g., robotics, autonomous driving). Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) helps infer human preferences, but it is costly to ensure reliability from human demonstrations.

Method: The authors propose PAC-EIG, a theoretical acquisition function that maximizes information gain about policy regret, enabling efficient selection of human demonstrations. They also introduce Reward-EIG as an alternative for reward-focused learning, proving convergence bounds and experimentally validating their approach.

Result: The PAC-EIG method shows superior performance in selecting critical states for demonstrations, avoids failure modes of heuristic methods, and provides probably-approximately-correct guarantees for learned policies in finite state-action spaces.

Conclusion: PAC-EIG advances reliable and efficient policy learning in active IRL by leveraging information-theoretic approaches. It is especially useful for safety-critical AI systems requiring formal performance guarantees.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a new neural architecture inspired by the primate visual system to address limitations of CNNs, achieving superior results on specialized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern CNNs face shortcomings such as inefficiency, limited out-of-distribution generalization, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. The primate visual system offers a model of higher efficiency and robustness.

Method: VCNet is designed based on the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex, emulating biological mechanisms like hierarchical processing, information segregation, and predictive feedback. Evaluations were conducted on Spots-10 and light field image classification benchmarks.

Result: VCNet achieved 92.1% classification accuracy on Spots-10 and 74.4% on the light field dataset, outperforming comparable models.

Conclusion: Integrating neuroscientific principles into artificial network design can enhance efficiency and robustness, offering solutions to persistent challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a next-generation communication system combining optical and simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), with novel models for signal relaying and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-terrestrial network (NTN) systems face challenges in achieving efficient signal transmission and coverage for indoor and outdoor users.

Method: The system integrates optical IRS on high-altitude platforms with STAR-IRS on buildings, includes amplify-and-forward relaying and novel modeling for both optical and radio-frequency links.

Result: Analytical expressions are derived for outage probability, ergodic capacity, and bit error rates using precise channel modeling and approximations.

Conclusion: The proposed system improves accuracy in performance evaluation, demonstrates advanced channel modeling, and addresses multi-environment signal transmission issues effectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) system that
integrates optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) and simultaneous
transmitting and reflecting Intelligent reflecting surfaces (STAR-IRS) to
address critical challenges in next-generation communication networks. The
proposed system model features a signal transmitted from the optical ground
station (OGS) to the earth station (ES) via an OIRS mounted horizontally on a
high altitude platform (HAP). The ES uses an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay
with fixed gain for signal relaying, which is then transmitted through a
STAR-IRS vertically installed on a building to facilitate communication with
both indoor and outdoor users. The FSO link incorporates (multiple-input
multiple-output) MIMO technology, and this paper develops a channel model
specifically designed for scenarios where the number of OIRS units exceeds one.
For the radio-frequency (RF) link, a novel and highly precise approximation
method is introduced, offering superior accuracy compared to traditional
approaches based on the central limit theorem (CLT). Closed-form analytical
expressions for key performance metrics, including outage probability (OP),
ergodic capacity and average bit error rate (BER) are derived in terms of the
bivariate Fox-H function for this novel five hops system. Asymptotic
expressions at high SNR are also presented, providing insights into system
diversity order.

*Mikhail Mints,Finn Voichick,Leonidas Lampropoulos,Robert Rand*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in compiling quantum control constructs from Qunity and proposes optimization techniques for improved implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum programming languages often struggle to implement high-level abstractions like quantum control flow efficiently, which limits practical applications.

Method: The authors introduce new abstractions for Qunity’s core language, develop optimization techniques for compilation, and create a functional Qunity compiler that outputs OpenQASM 3.

Result: The optimized compiler substantially reduces the usage of qubits and gates, making quantum control constructs more practical.

Conclusion: This work improves on previous limitations of Qunity by providing an efficient compilation framework with substantial performance optimizations for quantum programs.

Abstract: Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit
model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging
to implement - especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity
language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form
of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the
resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working
implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very
inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably
large circuits.
  In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum
control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a
wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer
compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a
complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity
code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization
techniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including
both low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the
high-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits
and gates used by the compiler.

Method: The paper outlines three advancements: Verilog-to-C/C++ code porting to create a dataset, fine-tuning the model using abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided instruction prompting, and developing a semi-automated evaluation framework (VerilogEval) to assess code functionality.

Result: SAGE-HLS achieves nearly 100% success in code synthesizability and 75% in functional correctness when fine-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model.

Conclusion: SAGE-HLS demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned large language models in addressing critical challenges in HLS code generation, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving field of electronic design automation (EDA), the
complexity of hardware designs is increasing, necessitating more sophisticated
automation solutions. High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,
automates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However,
it faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and
optimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable
capabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due
to the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in
this domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS
code generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement
Verilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes
into corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement
a fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code
generation guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a
semi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the
functionality of the generated HLS code. Our experiments show that SAGE-HLS,
fined-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model, achieves a near 100% success rate
in code synthesizability and a 75% success rate in functional correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often struggle to understand substitution-based computational models in functional programming, especially with concepts like recursion, algebraic data types, and higher-order functions.

Method: The authors used a step-by-step tracing interpreter for a Haskell subset in an introductory programming course and gathered feedback to analyze its effectiveness.

Result: The interpreter helped clarify misconceptions and improved student understanding, with insights captured from student feedback.

Conclusion: The step-by-step interpreter proved effective for teaching functional programming, and the paper provides lessons learned and suggestions for future improvements.

Abstract: Learning functional programming requires learning a substitution-based
computational model. While substitution should be a familiar concept from
high-school algebra, students often have difficulty applying it to new
settings, such as recursive definitions, algebraic data types and higher-order
functions. Step-by-step interpreters have been shown to help beginners by
clarifying misconceptions and improving understanding.
  This paper reports on the experience of using a step-by-step tracing
interpreter for a subset of Haskell while teaching an introductory functional
programming course at the University of Porto. We describe the use of the
interpreter, present some feedback obtained from students, reflect on the
lessons learned and point directions for further work.

*Mohamed Irfan Refai,Abdulaziz Y. Alkayas,Anup Teejo Mathew,Federico Renda,Thomas George Thuruthel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an image-based, learning framework to estimate contact forces in a finger-exosuit system. The approach generalizes well to unseen conditions and serves as a real-time alternative to physical force sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance wearable assistive devices which are becoming softer and require accurate modeling to capture interactions with human tissue.

Method: The researchers used the SoRoSim toolbox for dataset generation and developed a learning framework relying on low-resolution grayscale images for force estimation.

Result: Accurate estimation of interaction forces across multiple locations, generalization to unseen scenarios, and robustness under visual noise and contrast variations.

Conclusion: The vision-based estimator acts as a surrogate force sensor in feedback control systems, offering a non-intrusive real-time solution for exosuit force estimation.

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces HASTA, a robot with tunable leg stiffness to optimize energy efficiency during vertical hopping on various terrains, demonstrating improved performance depending on ground conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve energy-efficient vertical hopping on diverse ground profiles by adjusting leg stiffness, thereby addressing challenges in terrain adaptation.

Method: The researchers designed and implemented HASTA, a robot with adjustable leg stiffness, conducting experimental tests and simulations to evaluate the impact of stiffness on hopping height under different terrain conditions.

Result: The study identifies optimal leg stiffness configurations for various terrain types, confirming tunable stiffness enhances energy-efficient locomotion and achieves maximum hopping height.

Conclusion: Tunable leg stiffness is beneficial for energy efficiency and locomotion optimization; the findings also provide guidance for future controller development and robotic design improvements.

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

TL;DR: The study explores using zoomorphic robots for animal welfare education targeting children, identified via Participatory Design workshops with educators and children.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance animal welfare education by fostering positive and safe child-animal interactions using robots customized for the purpose.

Method: The researchers conducted Participatory Design workshops to gather insights on requirements for robot design from animal welfare educators and children.

Result: Insights included considerations for robot appearance, behavior, features, and narrative concepts, emphasizing cues signaling animal states, natural textures, and addressing undesirable child behavior.

Conclusion: Achieving consensus among groups presents challenges, but novel design activities can enrich the development process for robotic tools in animal welfare education.

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help
children learn about animals and their behavior, and thereby promote positive,
safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

### [339] [Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919)
*Boyang Tian,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a modular framework enhancing safety in autonomous driving by adaptively quantifying risks and modifying behavior in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of precise, interpretable, and integrable real-time risk assessment systems for autonomous driving across diverse scenarios.

Method: The method involves creating CRI, which quantifies risks using object kinematics and spatial relationships, applies Responsibility-Sensitive Safety principles for spatial partitioning, uses a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and adopts an adaptive control policy for behavioral adjustments.

Result: CRI was evaluated on 220 safety-critical scenarios using the Bench2Drive benchmark with a Transfuser++ model, leading to significant reductions in collision rates and penalty scores along with an increase in driving performance scores, all with very low runtime overhead.

Conclusion: CRI effectively improves the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles in complex scenarios while remaining modular and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel mechanism for robots to adapt dynamically using Hebbian learning integrated with Genetic Algorithms, verified in a T-maze navigation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable robots to handle unforeseen real-time challenges effectively by mimicking the dynamic adaptability of human synapses.

Method: A hybrid system combining Genetic Algorithm-based control with Hebbian plasticity, with fitness functions scaling Hebbian learning during runtime.

Result: The approach was tested on an e-puck robot with dynamic challenges like changing light and obstacles, showing promising adaptability.

Conclusion: The method successfully demonstrated real-time adaptation, preserving core knowledge while offering temporary adjustments during runtime, enabling robust performance in unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

*Zenan Zhu,Wenxi Chen,Pei-Chun Kao,Janelle Clark,Lily Behnke,Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio,Holly Yanco,Yan Gu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-agnostic meta-learning framework using fabric-based wearable sensors for accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain geometry, ensuring strong generalization across individuals and terrains with minimal calibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods using rigid sensors like inertial measurement units are less comfortable and suffer from challenges such as nonlinearities due to fabric properties, inter-subject variability, and limited real-world calibration data.

Method: The study integrates MAML within a deep learning architecture to find a generalizable model initialization, enabling efficient adaptation to new subjects using minimal calibration and fine-tuning, while maintaining high accuracy across various terrains.

Result: Experiments involving nine participants and five terrain types demonstrated improved performance in gait phase, locomotion mode, and incline angle estimation compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for wearable gait and terrain estimation, achieving superior accuracy, adaptability, and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air filters inadequately address respiratory aerosol concentration dynamics, especially those from coughs in healthcare or public spaces.

Method: The study uses a robotic cough emulator and a digital-twin model (combining a physics-based compartment approach and LSTM networks) for aerosol analysis.

Result: Experimental validation achieved mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds for aerosol concentration dynamics.

Conclusion: The system offers enhanced real-time air purification strategies, improving safety in environments prone to airborne diseases.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

*Hassan Iqbal,Kobiny Rex,Joseph Shirley,Carlos Baiz,Christian Claudel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a robotic platform for detecting and analyzing microplastics on beaches, using cameras and near-infrared spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting and mapping microplastics on beaches, which are environmental contaminants.

Method: A robotic manipulator with a mounted camera scans beaches for microplastics, segments candidates, and uses NIR spectroscopy for real-time analysis.

Result: The system demonstrated high positional precision in manipulation and accuracy in classifying microplastics in lab and beach tests.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in automating microplastic detection and analysis on beach environments.

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

*Adarsh Salagame,Eric Sihite,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses contact-rich problems in snake robot locomotion by presenting a reduced-order model for optimization and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Snake robot locomotion involves complex interactions, and existing research often oversimplifies or overcomplicates these dynamics without addressing simpler, practical frameworks.

Method: The authors developed a reduced-order model using Moreau's stepping-forward approach and verified it through simulations and experiments.

Result: The proposed model was validated for accuracy and experimentally demonstrated to work effectively.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical framework for addressing challenging contact and control allocation issues in snake locomotion.

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing the design, development, and validation of autonomous robots, removing dependence on human-coded architectures.

Method: The researchers used AI models to generate all code for a real-time drone command and control system, deploying it on both an actual drone and a simulated cloud-based drone.

Result: The AI-generated system demonstrated functionalities like real-time mapping, autonomous mission planning, and safety protocols with significantly faster development cycles, though limited by context window and reasoning capabilities of current AI models.

Conclusion: This work sets a groundbreaking precedent in AI-driven robotics, suggesting a future paradigm where robots and their systems may be primarily co-designed and developed by AI.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future

TL;DR: This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for efficient and multimodal object manipulation tasks in cluttered environments without requiring expert data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for object manipulation in robots are either inefficient, require expert demonstrations, or rely on trial-and-error learning, making them unsuitable for practical applications.

Method: The proposed method introduces a multimodal PINN that solves the Eikonal equation efficiently to find object manipulation trajectories. It includes reactive replanning of robot grasps to achieve desired object poses.

Result: The approach shows effectiveness across various objects, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training efficiency, planning time, trajectory length, and success rates, and is validated in both simulations and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed PINN is a robust and practical solution for object manipulation, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration

*Lucas Chen,Guna Avula,Hanwen Ren,Zixing Wang,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for human-robot object handover, emphasizing the robot's ability to interpret human preferences for smoother interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to human-robot object handover lack integration of human implicit and explicit preferences, leading to unnatural interactions.

Method: The framework combines human verbal and non-verbal commands for object selection and generates robot grasps and motion sequences contextualized to human preferences.

Result: Real-world experiments and user studies validate the framework's capability to interpret preferences and effectively perform object handovers.

Conclusion: Incorporating human preferences improves the naturalness and efficiency of human-robot handovers, making it viable for daily-life applications.

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our

*Bibek Gupta,Mintae Kim,Albert Park,Eric Sihite,Koushil Sreenath,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores two methods for estimating aerodynamic forces on a flapping-wing robot inspired by bat flight: a physics-based observer using Hamiltonian mechanics and a neural network model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots by accurately estimating aerodynamic forces, particularly for dynamic morphing capabilities.

Method: The paper compares a physics-based "conjugate momentum" observer using real-time sensor data with a neural network regression model trained on joint kinematics, frequency, and environmental parameters. Both methods are tested and validated with high-frequency force data from a 6-axis load cell.

Result: Both methods (physics-based and neural network) show strong agreement in estimating three force components (Fx, Fy, Fz) during periodic wingbeats.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of both methods for aerodynamic force estimation, marking progress toward real-time control and modeling of dynamic flight in robotic platforms.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework, Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning, that automates curriculum design for robotics tasks to reduce manual effort and improve performance. Tested on robot navigation and locomotion, it achieved notable improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for curriculum learning in robotics require manual design, which is effort-intensive and prone to human biases, while automated methods are limited to simpler domains. This paper aims to address the challenge of developing adaptive, automated curricula for complex robotics tasks.

Method: The proposed Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning framework includes three innovations: (1) task representation to support complex robot tasks, (2) adaptive curriculum generation using active performance tracking, and (3) grounding through alternating sampling between real and synthetic tasks to maintain relevance to target domains.

Result: GACL was validated on robotics challenges such as navigation in constrained spaces and locomotion in 3D environments, achieving 6.8% and 6.1% higher success rates when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that automated curriculum learning tailored for robotics can significantly outperform manually designed or previous automated curricula, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for training complex tasks.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

### [350] [Thruster-Enhanced Locomotion: A Decoupled Model Predictive Control with Learned Contact Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03003)
*Chenghao Wang,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, integrates posture manipulation and thrust vectoring using a decoupled control architecture featuring learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD), outperforming methods without CRD in push recovery and gait stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of controlling a quadrupedal robot with both thrusters and joint actuators, seeking to enhance locomotion capabilities such as thrust-assisted narrow-path walking in a way that compensates for system limitations like low torque-control bandwidth.

Method: A decoupled control architecture was proposed, separating legged locomotion control via a position-based Raibert-style controller from a Model Predictive Controller regulating thrusters. Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) were integrated with the thruster MPC to model leg-ground impact dynamics.

Result: Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrated that integrating CRD into the control framework resulted in more stable push recovery and a smoother cat-like walking gait compared to a similar control framework lacking CRD.

Conclusion: The decoupled control architecture with CRD effectively enhances robotic stability and locomotion by overcoming the system's torque-control limitations and optimizing ground impact handling through learned dynamics.

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

*Jie Lin,Hsun-Yu Lee,Ho-Ming Li,Fang-Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiGen, an indoor localization system using ambient light's spectral fingerprints, enhanced by GAN-based data augmentation, and achieves superior accuracy and robustness over Wi-Fi methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems often fail due to environmental factors, leading to a need for a more stable and infrastructure-free alternative.

Method: LiGen leverages ambient light spectral intensity as localization fingerprints, uses GANs (PointGAN and FreeGAN) for data augmentation, and applies an MLP model for achieving accurate submeter-level positioning.

Result: LiGen outperforms Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50% in accuracy and shows strong resilience in complex, cluttered environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel and effective use of spectral fingerprints combined with GAN-based data augmentation for robust, infrastructure-free indoor localization.

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

*Yizhuo Wang,Haodong He,Jingsong Liang,Yuhong Cao,Ritabrata Chakraborty,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CogniPlan is a novel path planning framework for robots that uses generative models for layout prediction to improve exploration and navigation in unknown environments, outperforming existing planners in various tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of autonomous path planning in unknown environments, enabling robots to explore and navigate more effectively by reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: CogniPlan incorporates predictions from a Conditional Generative Inpainting model to generate plausible layout maps, and combines them with a graph-attention-based path planner to improve scalability and fidelity.

Result: CogniPlan achieves significant performance improvements in robot exploration and navigation tasks, evaluated on large-scale datasets, a high-fidelity simulator, and real-world hardware testing.

Conclusion: CogniPlan offers a robust solution for efficient and reliable path planning in unknown environments, demonstrating both theoretical advancements and practical viability.

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

### [353] [Aerobatic maneuvers in insect-scale flapping-wing aerial robots via deep-learned robust tube model predictive control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03043)
*Yi-Hsuan Hsiao,Andrea Tagliabue,Owen Matteson,Suhan Kim,Tong Zhao,Jonathan P. How,YuFeng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces an advanced controller enabling insect-scale robots to achieve highly dynamic and agile flight maneuvers, overcoming key limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between aerial insects and insect-scale robots in terms of agility and robustness during flight maneuvers.

Method: The authors designed a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller combined with imitation learning for real-time feedback control in compute-constrained systems.

Result: The robot achieved significant improvements, including high-speed saccade movements, robustness to disturbances, and consecutive body flips.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates insect-like agility in sub-gram flyers, marking a breakthrough in robotic flight capabilities and paving the way for further advancements in autonomous sensing and computation.

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sketch map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), where an agent uses hand-drawn sketch maps to navigate unseen environments. It presents a dataset, SoR, and a new navigation framework, SkeNavigator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To draw inspiration from human strategies of using sketch maps for navigation and enable embodied AI agents to navigate environments using similar methods.

Method: Developed a dataset called SoR with 54k trajectory-sketch map pairs and proposed SkeNavigator, which uses a Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) and a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor (DAGP) for alignment and target estimation.

Result: SkeNavigator outperformed existing floor plan navigation methods, with a significant improvement in SPL (Success weighted by Path Length) on abstract validation sets by 105%.

Conclusion: Sketch map-based navigation is a promising direction, and their contributions in the form of the SoR dataset and SkeNavigator offer a strong foundation for future research in this domain.

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HEAD is a framework that enables humanoids to autonomously learn navigation, locomotion, and reaching using human motion capture data and ego-centric vision perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing humanoid robots that can effectively navigate, perceive, and interact within complex human environments by leveraging both motion and vision data.

Method: The framework employs a modular approach where a high-level planner commands hand and eye positions/orientations, and a low-level policy learns whole-body movements using human motion capture and vision data.

Result: HEAD performs successfully in both simulated and real-world environments, showcasing its ability to navigate and reach in environments designed for humans.

Conclusion: By decoupling vision perception from physical actions and utilizing human-centric data, HEAD enables scalable and efficient learning for humanoid robots.

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

*Devin Crowley,Jeremy Dao,Helei Duan,Kevin Green,Jonathan Hurst,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents optimized running gaits for the bipedal robot Cassie, compares them with human biomechanics, and uses them to achieve the fastest 100m dash by a bipedal robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop running gaits for the robot Cassie that enable high-speed and efficient running, and to understand how they compare to human running mechanics.

Method: The approach involved optimizing gait efficiency for various speeds, comparing the results with human biomechanical studies, and integrating the gaits into a controller capable of completing real-world tasks like the 100m dash.

Result: The gaits for Cassie showed similarities to human biomechanics despite morphological differences, and the optimized gaits were effective enough to set a world record for the fastest 100m dash by a bipedal robot.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that bipedal robot running gaits can achieve high efficiency and performance, rivaling human running mechanics in key aspects and setting new benchmarks for robotic speed.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

*Sang Min Kim,Hyeongjun Heo,Junho Kim,Yonghyeon Lee,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Point2Act is proposed to enable robots to perform zero-shot tasks by directly identifying precise 3D action points using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of identifying accurate 3D action points for contextually described tasks, which current models fail to achieve with clarity due to dimensional constraints and ambiguities.

Method: The method involves introducing 3D relevancy fields for lightweight 2D point-level guidance, multi-view aggregation to address geometric and semantic uncertainties, and a full pipeline that integrates steps from scene capture to grasp pose extraction.

Result: The method enables highly localized reasoning of 3D spatial contexts and generates spatially grounded responses in under 20 seconds, making it suitable for practical robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Point2Act effectively translates natural language task descriptions to precise 3D action points, demonstrating its utility for zero-shot task execution in unseen environments.

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: MPC-SafeGIL offers a robust imitation learning framework for robots, focusing on safer policies by incorporating adversarial disturbances during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in imitation learning for robots and prevent learned policies from making errors in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Adversarial disturbances are introduced during expert demonstrations using sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) to train safer imitation policies.

Result: Simulations and experiments showcase safer and more effective robot behaviors in quadruped locomotion, visuomotor navigation, and quadrotor operations.

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL improves both safety and task performance in imitation learning by integrating adversarial safety considerations directly into the training process.

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

*Mintaek Oh,Chan Kim,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel navigation framework that combines visual-language models and geometric maps for robots, enabling them to proactively anticipate and plan around hazards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in dynamic environments face challenges with traditional reactive systems, which rely on static maps and struggle to predict dynamic risks.

Method: The framework uses pre-trained vision-language models for zero-shot interpretation of visual scenes to assess potential risks and design cost maps based on these anticipations.

Result: Their experiments show significant improvement in navigation success rates and reduced hazard encounters compared to traditional reactive systems.

Conclusion: The integration of vision-language models with geometric maps effectively enables proactive hazard assessment and navigation in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing embodied planning benchmarks, which typically focus on short-horizon tasks and coarse-grained action primitives, by creating a setup that emphasizes long-horizon tasks in realistic settings.

Method: CookBench employs a two-stage task framework in a high-fidelity Unity-based simulation. The framework includes Intention Recognition and Embodied Interaction. Researchers can use a unified API for both macro-level and fine-grained actions.

Result: The paper highlights observable shortcomings of state-of-the-art AI models like Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models in handling long-horizon, complex tasks. CookBench offers tools to push research further.

Conclusion: CookBench defines new challenges in embodied planning by offering a realistic and detailed benchmark for long-horizon tasks. The open-sourced platform is expected to drive future advancements in AI planning and interaction.

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assist visually impaired users by enabling guide robots to navigate safely and effectively in dynamic, complex environments while incorporating real-time interaction.

Method: Developed a Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC) to adapt robot movements based on user-applied forces and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for safety. Introduced an Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN for obstacle clustering and Kalman filtering for trajectory prediction.

Result: The system, implemented on the HexGuide robot, successfully adapts to user force commands and ensures both user and robot safety during navigation in complex environments.

Conclusion: The integrated system offers an advanced solution for force-compliance, obstacle avoidance, and user interaction, demonstrating practical feasibility for guiding visually impaired users.

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous grasp datasets mainly prioritize grasp stability, overlooking functional grasps critical for real-world tasks such as handling objects effectively.

Method: The authors utilize a biomimicry-inspired approach to map natural human motions to various robotic hand designs. Geometry-based force closure is employed to ensure functional, stable, and human-like grasps for multiple hand types.

Result: The UniFucGrasp dataset successfully validates improved accuracy in functional manipulation, enhanced grasp stability, efficient generalization across robotic hands, and reduced annotation costs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that UniFucGrasp resolves challenges in dexterous grasping, enabling cost-effective annotation and better functional task performance for diverse robotic hands.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method optimized for turbid underwater environments, combining sonar and visual data. It avoids traditional point feature identification and compares favorably against existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust scene reconstruction method for underwater robots operating in turbid waters, addressing the challenges posed by low reliability of monocular vision and low resolution of sonar.

Method: The method combines visual and sonar data, matching regions of interest in images with corresponding sonar data, and utilizes range data from sonar and elevation data from camera images for reconstruction.

Result: Experimental comparisons show the proposed method performs effectively at varying turbidity levels, with field tests in marina environments validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in underwater turbid conditions. The authors provide their code as open-source to promote reproducibility and community use.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

*Bojan Derajić,Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi,Sebastian Bernhard,Wolfgang Hönig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid MPC local planner using a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set for real-time implementation, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe local planning in dynamic environments is challenging due to real-time constraints and the complexity of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis.

Method: A hybrid MPC local planner uses the signed distance function (SDF) and a neural residual modeled as a non-negative neural network, parametrized by a hypernetwork, to estimate the safe set value function in real-time.

Result: The new method achieves up to 30% higher success rates versus the best baseline, maintaining similar computational requirements and delivering low travel-time solutions.

Conclusion: This method offers a practical and efficient framework for real-time safe local planning in dynamic environments, combining theoretical rigour with practical performance advantages.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

*Pavlos Panagiotidis,Victor Zhi Heung Ngo,Sean Myatt,Roma Patel,Rachel Ramchurn,Alan Chamberlain,Ayse Kucukyilmaz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the 'theatre-in-the-loop' framework, which uses theatrical techniques to develop expressive robotic behaviors for artistic performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create expressive, emotionally engaging robotic gestures tailored for artistic performances, using human creative input during development.

Method: Using a director-guided workflow, puppeteers generate improvised robotic gestures driven by narrative objectives. These gestures are captured as templates for later autonomous performances.

Result: Initial trials showed the feasibility of crafting coherent emotional arcs in robotic gestures but also highlighted challenges stemming from robots' mechanical constraints.

Conclusion: The framework offers a model for interdisciplinary collaboration, blending theatre and robotics to enhance socially expressive robot behaviors and co-creation practices.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

### [366] [CollaBot: Vision-Language Guided Simultaneous Collaborative Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03526)
*Kun Song,Shentao Ma,Gaoming Chen,Ninglong Jin,Guangbao Zhao,Mingyu Ding,Zhenhua Xiong,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents CollaBot, a framework for multi-robot collaborative manipulation, achieving a 52% success rate across various tasks and robot configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for scalable and generalizable systems for interacting with large objects in robotics, particularly in collaborative multi-robot scenarios.

Method: CollaBot uses SEEM for scene segmentation and point cloud extraction, a collaborative grasping framework for task decomposition, and a 2-stage planning module for collision-free trajectory generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated a 52% success rate, validating CollaBot's effectiveness across diverse configurations of robots, objects, and tasks.

Conclusion: CollaBot offers a scalable, generalizable framework for effective multi-robot collaborative manipulation, addressing prior research gaps.

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [367] [Vision-based Perception System for Automated Delivery Robot-Pedestrians Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03541)
*Ergi Tushe,Bilal Farooq*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a vision-based system to improve pedestrian detection and tracking in urban spaces for Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs). It integrates pose estimation and depth cues, achieving significant advancements in tracking accuracy and social inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges faced by Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) in navigating crowded urban environments safely and efficiently while ensuring socially acceptable behavior.

Method: A vision sensor-based pipeline was developed that combines multi-pedestrian detection, tracking, pose estimation, and monocular depth perception, using the real-world MOT17 dataset.

Result: The study showed improvements in identity preservation (IDF1 by up to 10%), multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA by 7%), and detection precision consistently over 85% in dense and occluded environments.

Conclusion: The integration of pose estimation and depth cues enhances the pedestrian trajectory prediction and promotes socially aware robotic behavior, suggesting it can lead to safer and more inclusive urban navigation systems for ADRs.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware
and inclusive robot behaviour.

### [368] [Online Learning for Vibration Suppression in Physical Robot Interaction using Power Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03559)
*Gokhan Solak,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced algorithm, the damped BMFLC, for vibration suppression in collaborative robots exposed to external disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative robots on construction sites face challenges with vibration caused by external forces, hindering their efficiency and functionality.

Method: The authors extend the BMFLC algorithm by introducing a damped BMFLC with an adaptive step-size and logistic function-based damping for better noise resistance and faster convergence.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show improved suppression rates and efficiency compared to existing methods, including recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.

Conclusion: The damped BMFLC method is effective and efficient for vibration suppression, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods, and is validated through simulations and field experiments.

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

### [369] [DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645)
*Akshay L Chandra,Iman Nematollahi,Chenguang Huang,Tim Welschehold,Wolfram Burgard,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiWA fine-tunes robotic skills using a world model and reinforcement learning, achieving significant efficiency improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the practicality and safety of fine-tuning robotic skills using diffusion policies by addressing inefficiencies in reward propagation and reliance on environment interactions.

Method: DiWA employs an offline-trained world model with reinforcement learning instead of requiring millions of real-world interactions.

Result: DiWA achieves notable success in offline robotic skill adaptation with fewer physical interactions compared to model-free methods, validated on the CALVIN benchmark.

Conclusion: DiWA efficiently fine-tunes diffusion policies for robotics by leveraging offline models, presenting a safer and more practical approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

*Zhongbi Luo,Yunjia Wang,Jan Swevers,Peter Slaets,Herman Bruyninckx*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Inland-LOAM is a LiDAR SLAM framework tailored for safe and autonomous Inland Waterway Transport (IWT), addressing limitations in existing geospatial methods and charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve geospatial information necessary for safe IWT navigation, considering limitations in IENC charts and conventional LiDAR SLAM systems in waterway scenarios.

Method: Introduces improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint within the LiDAR SLAM framework. Employs a pipeline to convert 3D point clouds into 2D semantic maps, including navigation-critical data like bridge clearances and shorelines.

Result: Inland-LOAM demonstrated better localization accuracy against existing methods and produced real-world-aligned semantic maps and shorelines, proving effectiveness and reliability.

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM enhances geospatial data utility for IWT, supports real-time situational awareness, and solves challenges faced by existing solutions; code and datasets will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available

### [371] [Blueprint First, Model Second: A Framework for Deterministic LLM Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02721)
*Libin Qiu,Yuhang Ye,Zhirong Gao,Xide Zou,Junfu Chen,Ziming Gui,Weizhi Huang,Xiaobo Xue,Wenkai Qiu,Kun Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Source Code Agent framework to address non-determinism in large language model (LLM) agents by separating procedural logic from generative execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises to overcome the limitations of LLMs in scenarios requiring procedural fidelity and predictable execution, which their non-deterministic nature and conflated planning hinder.

Method: The proposed framework decouples workflow logic and uses an Execution Blueprint combined with a deterministic engine. LLMs are applied selectively for specific tasks without steering the workflow.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines by 10.1% on tau-bench benchmarks and increasing execution efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework allows reliable application of autonomous agents in environments demanding strict procedural adherence, offering improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM)
agents limits their application in structured operational environments where
procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This
limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,
high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative
process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new
paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework
decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined
operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution
Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is
strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex
sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,
designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the
Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the
strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while
dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable
and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict
procedural logic.

### [372] [Interpreting Performance Profiles with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02729)
*Zhuoran Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to combine performance profiling with program semantics using deep learning for better optimization insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software engineers find it challenging to interpret complex profiling data and relate inefficiencies to program semantics, especially for third-party code.

Method: An integration of Async Profiler for runtime data and a CodeBERT-based model for code summarization, presented via a graphic UI.

Result: The system enhanced performance analysis across various Java benchmarks and linked inefficiencies to actionable insights.

Conclusion: Combining profiling tools with code semantics bridges gaps in performance analysis, offering effective optimization support for engineers.

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in
understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks,
and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give
extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are
responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable
optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users
to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users
are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles
and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean
code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it
into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for
actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async
Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a
fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any
selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively
assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Code Quality Score (CQS) system, powered by fine-tuned Llama3 models, to detect code quality issues and provide actionable insights for large-scale software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems, especially where numerous engineers work concurrently.

Method: Utilizes two fine-tuned Llama3 models (SFT and offline RL) to identify code quality issues and provide critiques, combined with hand-crafted rules to filter incorrect responses.

Result: Shows a high precision rate for detecting valid issues and achieves a 60% week-over-week user helpfulness rate in industrial-scale implementation.

Conclusion: CQS system effectively aids developers in maintaining code quality, with promising results in real-world applications.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant
challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work
concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS)
system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide
actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3
models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common
code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good
``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user
experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect
responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able
to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This
system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting
and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate,
demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we
present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating
developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

*Rijul Jain,Shraddha Barke,Gabriel Ebner,Md Rakib Hossain Misu,Shan Lu,Sarah Fakhoury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes how expert developers interact with proof-oriented programming languages, revealing strategies and challenges in proof development, and provides design guidance for AI proof assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the proof-development process in proof-oriented programming languages to overcome challenges in broader adoption and aid in developing proof-synthesis tools.

Method: The authors conducted a user study collecting fine-grained telemetry data from eight experts using F* and Verus languages, analyzing their problem-solving strategies and practices.

Result: The study identified three distinct strategies, informal practices predictive of success, and key challenges; these findings were applied to guide AI proof assistant design and tested on an F* proof agent.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into the proof engineering process, proposing concrete recommendations for AI proof assistant development, which enhanced agent performance over baseline models.

Abstract: Proof-oriented programming languages (POPLs) empower developers to write code
alongside formal correctness proofs, providing formal guarantees that the code
adheres to specified requirements. Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs
present a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader
software community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development
process and how expert proof developers interact with POPLs has hindered the
advancement of effective proof engineering and the development of
proof-synthesis models/tools.
  In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis
of fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two
languages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about
how experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof
development process. We identify three distinct strategies and multiple
informal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are
predictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design
guidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting,
explicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined
verifier interaction. We also present a case study of an F* proof agent
grounded in these recommendations, and demonstrate improved performance over
baseline LLMs

### [375] [Automated Code Repair for C/C++ Static Analysis Alerts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02820)
*David Svoboda,Lori Flynn,William Klieber,Michael Duggan,Nicholas Reimer,Joseph Sible*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses a preprint describing the development and application of an automated program repair (APR) tool that fixes C/C++ code defects identified by static analysis tools, effectively reducing false positives in diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive process of manually identifying true-positive alerts and repairing defects in C/C++ code detected by static analysis tools, which often produce many false positive alerts.

Method: The authors developed an APR tool capable of repairing three categories of alerts in C/C++ code. The tool was extensively tested across multiple static analysis tools, codebases, and flaw categories.

Result: The APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts on one codebase and achieved an average repair or dismissal rate of over 80% across multiple flaw categories, tools, and codebases. Repairs did not significantly degrade code performance or introduce new alerts, except for one possible exception.

Conclusion: The APR tool successfully reduced false positives and manual effort in code analysis, provided lessons learned in tool development, prompted updates in CERT Coding Standards, and published a valuable repair dataset for open-source codebases.

Abstract: (Note: This work is a preprint.) Static analysis (SA) tools produce many
diagnostic alerts indicating that source code in C or C++ may be defective and
potentially vulnerable to security exploits. Many of these alerts are false
positives. Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in
the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools
can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA
alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code.
This engineering experience paper details the application of design,
development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++
code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its
repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the
maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics
used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We
discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and
acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts
produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2
flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as
false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not
appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear
(with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique
contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection
method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a
dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It
discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.

*Thomas S. Heinze,André Schäfer,Wolfram Amme*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces StoneDetector, a tool to identify code clones in Java source and Bytecode using dominator trees and textual path comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like bug propagation and software bloating caused by code clones in programming projects.

Method: StoneDetector uses textual comparisons of paths derived from dominator tree representations of code to detect various types of code clones.

Result: StoneDetector performs well in identifying code clones, including hard-to-detect ones, in Java source and Bytecode, as demonstrated using state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The StoneDetector platform is versatile, scalable, and effective in clone detection, offering multiple configuration options to improve performance.

Abstract: Copy & paste is a widespread practice when developing software and, thus,
duplicated and subsequently modified code occurs frequently in software
projects. Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code,
can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability
propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present
the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in
Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone
detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the
code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only
find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code
clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We
demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection
platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including
the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our
exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and
scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.

*Ora Nova Fandina,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Rami Katan,Alice Podolsky,Orna Raz,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: REFINE is a framework to benchmark and improve LLM-based evaluators in software engineering tasks by generating hierarchical datasets and aligning rankings to expected artifact quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators for code artifacts is challenging due to the limitations of human evaluations and existing automated methods.

Method: REFINE employs a Hierarchy Dataset Builder for artifacts with controlled degradation levels and an Evaluator Tester to rank LLMs based on alignment to expected quality orders.

Result: REFINE improved coding task alignment scores for COBOL-related tasks, achieving over 0.9 in some cases, and is now integrated into IBM's workflows.

Conclusion: REFINE successfully enables nuanced and scalable evaluation of LLMs in practical software engineering contexts such as enterprise-level coding tasks.

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language
models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However,
establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human
evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated
methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation),
an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software
engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder
applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with
progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate
evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with
expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of
degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse
filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the
practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's
internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and
summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using
industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that
lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.
These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams
to support model release decisions.

*Iti Shree,Karine Even-Mendoz,Tomasz Radzik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReFuzzer enhances LLM-generated compiler fuzzing by correcting syntax and runtime errors, improving test program validity and code coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compiler fuzzers often generate invalid test programs, reducing their effectiveness for robust testing of compiler components.

Method: ReFuzzer utilizes a feedback loop with a local LLM to detect and correct compilation and runtime violations, ensuring valid test programs.

Result: ReFuzzer boosted test program validity to over 96% and demonstrated significant improvements in code coverage, especially in critical optimization components.

Conclusion: ReFuzzer effectively refines LLM-generated tests, advancing compiler fuzzing effectiveness and aiding in comprehensive validation of compiler optimizations.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or
semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising
compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a
framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting
and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or
array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local
LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving
fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of
diverse yet valid test programs.
  We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box
fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs'
validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of
2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing
significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR
generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute
improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing,

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AdaptForge, a low-code engineering tool, to help software practitioners efficiently develop accessible and adaptive applications for older adults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ageing global population creates a need for technologies promoting seniors' independence while reducing accessibility barriers in conventional software.

Method: An empirical study was conducted involving 18 software practitioners to evaluate AdaptForge, a low-code tool for accessible and adaptive app development.

Result: AdaptForge mitigates development constraints using automated code generation, enabling efficient creation of applications tailored for older adults.

Conclusion: The paper offers recommendations for designing low-code tools compliant with developer expectations, aiming for industry-standard adoption in accessible software crafting.

Abstract: The global ageing population presents a growing societal challenge, creating
an urgent need for inclusive technologies that promote autonomy among older
adults. Software practitioners can address this by delivering digital services
that enhance seniors' independence and reduce reliance on routine support from
family members and healthcare infrastructure. However, traditional development
practices, constrained by time and resources, often result in applications with
major accessibility and personalisation barriers. Increasing pressure from
regulatory requirements, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), and the
personal empathy many developers feel toward supporting their older loved ones
and their own future selves have created a demand for tools that support the
development of accessible and adaptive software. To address this demand, this
paper presents an interview-based empirical study with 18 software
practitioners, evaluating AdaptForge: a low-code model-driven engineering (MDE)
tool that enables the efficient creation of accessible and adaptive
applications for senior users by mitigating development constraints through
automated code generation. Based on these insights, we identify developer
expectations for adopting such tools as industry-standard solutions and provide
empirically grounded recommendations for designing low-code tools that support
accessible and adaptive software development.

### [380] [MRG-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring the Requirements of Context for Repository-Level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02998)
*Haiyang Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MRG-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating code generation by LLMs, focusing on real-world repository-level tasks with multi-language support (Python, Java, Go). Evaluation reveals a widespread inability of current models to understand user requirements accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evaluation datasets for code generation by LLMs have significant flaws, such as limited programming language support, lack of runnable test cases, and deviation from real-world code distributions, leading to unreliable results.

Method: The authors developed MRG-Bench, a benchmark dataset featuring practical data from real-world repositories, multi-language support (Python, Java, Go), and project-level runnable test cases. They conducted experiments with LLMs, long-context models, and RAG approaches and offered a diagnostic analysis of errors.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that current models perform poorly in repository-level code generation, primarily struggling to understand user requirements and exhibiting disparities based on programming languages.

Conclusion: MRG-Bench enables a more credible evaluation of LLMs and reveals critical shortcomings, emphasizing the need for improved contextual design tailored to specific programming languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such
as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of
real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These
limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language
Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a
more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation
tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from
real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2)
multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3)
project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code.
  Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large
language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation
results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation
techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}. To further
investigate why models fail, we designed novel experiments to annotate the
underlying causes of generation errors. The results explicitly show that the
majority of methods suffer from "\textbf{difficulty in understanding user
requirements}," failing to comprehend their assigned tasks accurately.
Moreover, the impact of different repository-level contexts on this issue
exhibits significant disparities across different programming languages,
suggesting that, in practice, specialized contextual information needs to be
designed for different languages.

*Zexiong Ma,Chao Peng,Qunhong Zeng,Pengfei Gao,Yanzhen Zou,Bing Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolTrain, a training framework that enhances LLMs' abilities in issue localization by integrating repository retrieval tools and multi-step reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results on localization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of issue localization in software, where there is a semantic gap between natural language descriptions and faulty code, requiring complex multi-step reasoning through code dependencies.

Method: The method involves ToolTrain, a two-stage training framework with rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to improve LLMs' skills in using repository retrieval tools for issue localization.

Result: ToolTrain-trained models achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models like Claude-3.7 in function-level issue localization and enhancing end-to-end issue resolution.

Conclusion: The study concludes that training LLMs for issue localization improves software development automation, showing it as an effective strategy for advancing model performance in this domain.

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need
modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in
software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue
descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code
dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating
repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a
demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively
utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning
and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a
two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance
LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental
results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level
localization. The results also show that improved localization performance
translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further
demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective
strategy for improving automated software development.

### [382] [A System Model Generation Benchmark from Natural Language Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03215)
*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Zheng Fang,Jia Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate system models, introduces a novel benchmark dataset called SysMBench, provides an evaluation metric named SysMEval, and evaluates 17 LLMs to demonstrate their current performance gaps in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation originates from the challenges in developing system models due to the complexity of syntax in model description languages and the lack of accessible public model examples. The authors aim to explore whether LLMs can aid in generating system models and find no available benchmarks to evaluate this capability.

Method: The authors introduce SysMBench, a dataset with 151 scenarios containing natural language requirements, system models in a description language, and visualized diagrams. They also propose a semantic-aware evaluation metric, SysMEval, to assess the quality of models generated by LLMs.

Result: The evaluation of 17 popular LLMs shows poor performance in generating system models using SysMBench. The highest scores achieved were a BLEU score of 4% and a SysMEval-F1 score of 62%, revealing significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: The study highlights the current limitations of LLMs in generating high-quality system models and provides both SysMBench and SysMEval as tools to foster further research in this area.

Abstract: System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal
abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems,
which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design.
However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific
syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model
examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model
development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to
generate system models with specific description languages. We present
SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of
popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a
natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a
specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The
requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with
description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms
to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual
validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to
evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on
this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting
to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows
that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and
SysMEval-F1 of 62%. We release the SysMBench and its evaluation framework to
enable future research on LLM-based system model generation.

### [383] [SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03258)
*Yueyue Liu,Hongyu Zhang,Yuantian Miao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces "SmartLLMs Scheduler" (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective framework for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, achieving significant performance and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs for diverse tasks faces challenges such as financial costs, response time, and performance variability. Existing static scheduling methods lack flexibility and require extensive training data, increasing computational expense and limiting adaptability.

Method: The proposed SLS includes three main components: (1) Adaptive Cache Manager to reduce redundant computations, (2) Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler for dynamic allocation based on performance and cost prediction, and (3) Dynamic Update Manager for real-time feedback adaptation to refine strategies.

Result: SLS outperforms baseline methods in two software engineering tasks (log parsing and code generation) by achieving 198.82% average performance improvement and reducing processing time by 63.28%.

Conclusion: SmartLLMs Scheduler advances LLM deployment strategies with a dynamic, real-time feedback-based approach, demonstrating substantial superiority in efficiency and effectiveness over traditional static methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable
capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the
advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high
financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when
handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for
deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires
extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the
computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this
paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective
scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse
tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies
periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an
Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic
Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed
queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and
minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler
dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted
performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific
features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and
scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to
enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate
the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based
software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The
results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving
an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time
reduction of 63.28%.

*Kristian Kolthoff,Felix Kretzer,Christian Bartelt,Alexander Maedche,Simone Paolo Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GUI-ReRank utilizes embedding-based constrained retrieval and MLLM-based reranking to improve GUI prototype retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art models and enhancing generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the resource-intensive process of GUI prototyping by improving retrieval performance for GUI repositories.

Method: Introduced GUI-ReRank, combining embedding-based models for rapid retrieval and multi-lingual language model (MLLM) reranking, along with a customizable pipeline for GUI repository annotation and embedding.

Result: GUI-ReRank surpassed tailored learning-to-rank (LTR) models in both accuracy and generalizability in NL-based GUI retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: GUI-ReRank is an effective and efficient solution for improving GUI retrieval, balancing computational cost with performance gains.

Abstract: GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern
interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application
domains. GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by
enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts
collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early
testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end
users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of
constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming,
frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has
sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches,
which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models
for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited
retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.
In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid
embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based
reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI
repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly
make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of
relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based
RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI
retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms
SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.
Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of
employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the
trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources. Video:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach to code optimization using multiple LLMs, achieving significant cost and time savings in regulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulated industries are constrained in their use of commercial LLMs due to data privacy and compliance regulations, presenting challenges in leveraging LLMs for efficient and high-quality code optimization.

Method: The study employs a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach, synthesizing code from multiple specialized LLMs, and evaluates it against TurinTech AI's Genetic Algorithm-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using a real-world dataset.

Result: The MoA approach achieves 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times with open-source models, validated across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations.

Conclusion: The MoA approach, along with deployment guidelines, provides a viable solution for regulated industries to optimize code efficiently and cost-effectively, outperforming individual LLMs and addressing compliance requirements in production.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization
have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering
at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries
face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize
commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements,
creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a
Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple
specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world
industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application
to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical
evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost
savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated
environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with
commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4)
Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations,
generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble
evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing
regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

*Alex Wolf,Marco Edoardo Palma,Pooja Rani,Harald C. Gall*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KANT is a solution for repository-level code comprehension addressing semantic fragmentation, retrieval inefficiencies, and privacy limitations, using knowledge anchors for efficient training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of repository-level code comprehension, including semantic fragmentation, inefficiency in retrieval mechanisms, scarcity of specific training data, and constraints of proprietary LLMs.

Method: Proposes Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT) that embed knowledge anchors into training and inference, localizing context, synthesizing specialized training data, and replacing verbose context for efficient deployment.

Result: KANT demonstrated over 60% human preference, 79% expert preference, reduced inference latency by up to 85%, and showed scalability for on-premise deployments.

Conclusion: KANT provides a robust approach for scalable, low-latency code comprehension, enhancing LLM implementation for industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core
challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However,
these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is
distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic
fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade
performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm
attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often
outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy
and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented
Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into
both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access
to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding
inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data
directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context,
reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise
deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the
synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions;
compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference
speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability.
Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking
needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack
expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to
85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency,
on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.

well-being and performance, particularly in collaborative and dynamic domains
such as software development. Despite its acknowledged significance, research
on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The
socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development
present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no
systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the
context of software engineering.
  Objective: This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the
existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it
seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with
the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software
development process.

software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson's
framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team,
and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and
leadership behaviors.
  Conclusion: PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within
software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the
contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective
strategies for its enhancement. Future research should address these gaps by
investigating the practical applications of PS within diverse organizational
settings in the software engineering domain.

Method: The authors conducted a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning to identify and categorize 29 motivators and 27 demotivators into high-level themes.

Result: The study categorized motivators and demotivators into five overarching thematic groups, providing a structured overview of factors influencing adoption.

Conclusion: The research offers an initial framework to aid organizations in preparing for an agent-first approach, laying the groundwork for a broader maturity model tailored for 6G software systems.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both
strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise
increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across

immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and
performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic
mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within
the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted
scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further
categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping
offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping
organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a
feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader
research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model
grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance of automated vulnerability repair using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4o, across multiple programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated vulnerability repair methods are restricted to specific programming languages like C/C++. Advances in LLMs provide language-agnostic capabilities, but work on their repair performance is still unsatisfactory.

Method: They conducted a large-scale empirical study evaluating automated vulnerability repair techniques and LLMs, specifically GPT-4o, across seven programming languages using few-shot prompting and instruction tuning.

Result: GPT-4o performs competitively against VulMaster, excels in repairing unique and dangerous vulnerabilities, and generalizes well to unseen programming languages. Go achieves the best effectiveness, while C/C++ lags across all models.

Conclusion: LLMs, with their multilingual and semantic capabilities, show significant promise in automated vulnerability repair, though challenges and limitations still exist.

Abstract: Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have
been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However,
these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities
and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome
multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore
LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address
these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate
the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and
state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o,
instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the
leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows
superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to
repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o
demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen
language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently
achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs
the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual
vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes
the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages,
highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual
vulnerability repair.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for resolving technical debt in enterprise codebases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise codebases face challenges due to growing complexity and the overwhelming volume of lint errors, which manual efforts cannot address efficiently.

Method: BitsAI-Fix uses tree-sitter for context expansion, generates patches with specialized LLMs, employs reinforcement learning for iterative training, and applies a rule-based reward mechanism to refine outputs. Its methodology tracks effectiveness with "code diff matching."

Result: In production deployment at ByteDance, BitsAI-Fix supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved over 12,000 issues, achieved 85% remediation accuracy, and had 1,000 weekly active users.

Conclusion: BitsAI-Fix demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-driven automated code remediation for industrial-scale use cases, offering a model for addressing technical debt efficiently in enterprises.

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume
of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to
continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency.
This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow
based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical
challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for
context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through
specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final
remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative
progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can
automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start
phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through
feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted
rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness
rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff
matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production
deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,
resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%
remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions
in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaTCoder is a novel approach for improving layout fidelity in design-to-code tasks using Chain-of-Thought reasoning and image block segmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models often fail to accurately preserve website layout during design-to-code processes.

Method: LaTCoder segments the webpage into image blocks, leverages a Chain-of-Thought-based prompting for code generation, and uses a combination of assembly strategies to ensure layout alignment.

Result: The approach achieved significant performance enhancements in metrics like TreeBLEU (+66.67%) and lower MAE (-38%) on complex benchmarks, with over 60% human preference for the generated webpages.

Conclusion: LaTCoder effectively bridges the gap in design-to-code tasks, ensuring better layout preservation and usability.

Abstract: Converting webpage designs into code (design-to-code) plays a vital role in
User Interface (UI) development for front-end developers, bridging the gap
between visual design and functional implementation. While recent Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in
design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during
code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that
enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with
Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet
efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we
prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block.
Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an
MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal
output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs
(i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly
introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts.
The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant
improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE
decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting.
Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators
favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong

### [392] [Intent Preserving Generation of Diverse and Idiomatic (Code-)Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03642)
*Oliver Westphal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficiently generating programming exercise tasks and their associated artifacts using abstract building blocks to streamline the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity in generating varied yet idiomatic programs and associated artifacts for programming exercises, such as behavior specifications and textual descriptions, demands a better, more adaptable design approach.

Method: The authors propose using a modular method where abstract building blocks are defined, each with multiple concrete realizations. These are then composed to automatically derive multiple related artifacts.

Result: This generic and adaptable approach enables efficient generation of varied artifacts suited for programming exercises, reducing complexity compared to manual generation.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies the creation of programming exercise tasks and compatible artifacts, offering a systematic and scalable solution adaptable across diverse contexts.

Abstract: When automatically generating programming exercise tasks one often also needs
to automatically generate programs. At the very least when providing sample
solutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part
of the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements.
  Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while
being easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are
intensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more
general behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions.
Manually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related
artifacts gets complicated quickly.
  We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for
multiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building
blocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations
for various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting
artifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks.
This abstract description then serves as the common source from which related
artifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of
artifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of
contexts.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores using path signatures for exotic derivatives hedging under non-Markovian models, demonstrating clear advantages over LSTMs and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the hedging of exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models by leveraging path signatures in machine learning.

Method: The study evaluates path signatures as features in feedforward neural networks and compares two regression approaches: direct learning of strategies and modeling volatility dynamics using a signature volatility model.

Result: Path signatures outperform LSTMs in deep learning with less computation. Using a calibrated signature volatility model achieves more accurate and robust hedging results.

Conclusion: Path signatures are effective and computationally efficient features for improving hedging strategies, surpassing traditional models in accuracy and stability.

Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for
hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In
a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural
networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of
magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two
regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the
expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of
volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected
signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated
signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across
different payoffs and volatility dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance empirical risk minimization performance by incorporating f-divergence regularization and improving computational methods for solving optimization problems.

Method: The paper leverages dual formulation, Legendre-Fenchel transform, and implicit function theorem to derive a nonlinear ODE for the normalization function.

Result: The nonlinear ODE expression offers a computationally efficient approach to calculate the normalization function under mild conditions.

Conclusion: The dual formulation and derived ODE provide an effective and computationally efficient framework for solving ERM-fDR problems.

Abstract: The dual formulation of empirical risk minimization with f-divergence
regularization (ERM-fDR) is introduced. The solution of the dual optimization
problem to the ERM-fDR is connected to the notion of normalization function
introduced as an implicit function. This dual approach leverages the
Legendre-Fenchel transform and the implicit function theorem to provide a
nonlinear ODE expression to the normalization function. Furthermore, the
nonlinear ODE expression and its properties provide a computationally efficient
method to calculate the normalization function of the ERM-fDR solution under a

*Zhanye Luo,Yuefeng Han,Xiufan Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (SDDP) to improve forecasting with high-dimensional predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance forecasting accuracy with high-dimensional data using dimension reduction techniques tailored for time series predictors.

Method: SDDP incorporates target variables and lag observations into factor extraction, leverages temporal neural networks for supervised factor scaling, and performs principal component analysis for prediction refinement.

Result: Empirical tests yield superior forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.

Conclusion: The SDDP method efficiently captures interpretable, target-specific factors, supports nonlinear dynamic forecasting, and performs well even with partially observable predictors.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving
time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel
Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that
incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor
extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct
target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised
manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting
power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware
predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor
extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting
task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors.
Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting
model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches.
To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies
to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially
observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on
several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm
achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

### [397] [Likelihood Matching for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03636)
*Lei Qian,Wu Su,Yanqi Huang,Song Xi Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Likelihood Matching approach to train diffusion models efficiently, leveraging quasi-likelihood estimations and stochastic sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency in calculating reverse sample likelihoods in diffusion models and improving model training.

Method: A quasi-likelihood approach approximates reverse transition densities with matched conditional mean and covariance using score and Hessian functions. A stochastic sampler aids computation.

Result: The method achieves consistency in quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and provides convergence guarantees with quantified approximation errors. Experiments validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Likelihood Matching improves diffusion model training by efficiently computing reverse sample likelihoods with strong theoretical backing.

Abstract: We propose a Likelihood Matching approach for training diffusion models by
first establishing an equivalence between the likelihood of the target data
distribution and a likelihood along the sample path of the reverse diffusion.
To efficiently compute the reverse sample likelihood, a quasi-likelihood is
considered to approximate each reverse transition density by a Gaussian
distribution with matched conditional mean and covariance, respectively. The
score and Hessian functions for the diffusion generation are estimated by
maximizing the quasi-likelihood, ensuring a consistent matching of both the
first two transitional moments between every two time points. A stochastic
sampler is introduced to facilitate computation that leverages on both the
estimated score and Hessian information. We establish consistency of the
quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and provide non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for the proposed sampler, quantifying the rates of the approximation
errors due to the score and Hessian estimation, dimensionality, and the number
of diffusion steps. Empirical and simulation evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed Likelihood Matching and validate the theoretical
results.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the optimization dynamics and sample complexity of gradient-based training for a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation, providing scaling laws for prediction risk in high-dimensional regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and characterize the behavior and performance of gradient-based training for high-dimensional two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations, under various data and model assumptions.

Method: The method involves analyzing the gradient-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics, utilizing matrix Riccati differential equations and matrix monotonicity arguments, along with considerations of both population limits and finite-sample effects.

Result: The paper derives scaling laws for prediction risk, showing power-law dependencies on factors such as optimization time, sample size, and model width, providing sharp results on SGD behavior in this regime.

Conclusion: The study establishes convergence guarantees and offers a rigorous framework to understand feature learning via SGD training for specific neural network architectures in the high-dimensional setting.

Abstract: We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of
a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the
high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $y \propto
\sum_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_j \sigma\left(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta_j},
\boldsymbol{x}\rangle\right), \boldsymbol{x} \sim N(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$,
$\sigma$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\lbrace\boldsymbol{\theta}_j
\rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We
consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$,
and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients
$\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis
of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population
limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws
for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the
optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a
precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation
with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees
for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.

*Ivan Yevenko,Hiroki Kojima,Chrystopher L. Nehaniv*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: The paper bridges analytical approaches with emergent complexity phenomena in continuous cellular automata (CCAs), employing dynamical systems theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between advancements in qualitative behavior of CCAs and the lack of rigorous analytical methods for understanding their complexity.

Method: Utilizing the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia and tools from dynamical systems theory, such as attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions, to mathematically characterize CCAs.

Result: Introduced mathematical explanations for solution classes in CCAs, identified conditions for fractal dimension attractors, validated Kaplan-Yorke dimension as a complexity measure, and provided a computational tool for Lyapunov exponents and vectors.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework to measure and understand complexity in CCAs, identifying key properties essential for artificial life systems.

Abstract: Continuous cellular automata (CCAs) have evolved from discrete lookup tables
to continuous partial differential equation (PDE) formulations in the search
for novel forms of complexity. Despite innovations in qualitative behavior,
analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent
complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical
systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov
exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors
mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for
the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic
patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal
dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective
complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation
for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs.
We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex
behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for
understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.

*Kisu Yang,Yoonna Jang,Hwanseok Jang,Kenneth Choi,Isabelle Augenstein,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of spurious ties in low-precision retrieval systems by proposing High-Precision Scoring (HPS) and Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM) to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the reliability of retrieval system evaluations, which is compromised by spurious ties caused by reduced granularity in low-precision relevance scoring.

Method: The authors propose two strategies: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS) to upcast final scoring to higher precision, and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM) to measure expected scores and biases in tied rankings.

Result: Experiments across models and datasets show that HPS substantially reduces instability from ties, while TRM effectively quantifies order uncertainty, improving evaluation robustness.

Conclusion: By combining HPS and TRM, the paper provides a framework that mitigates tie-induced variability in low-precision retrieval systems, enabling more reliable evaluation processes.

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiRAG, a framework to reduce hallucinations in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation by constructing logical relationships and assessing information reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address hallucination issues in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) when integrating information from multiple sources, which can exacerbate inaccuracies and conflicts in information.

Method: MultiRAG employs a knowledge construction module using line graphs to aggregate logical relationships and a retrieval module with multi-level confidence calculations to eliminate unreliable information nodes.

Result: Experiments on various query and QA datasets show that MultiRAG improves the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: MultiRAG effectively mitigates hallucination issues in multi-source RAG by introducing advanced graph-based aggregation and confidence assessment mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

TL;DR: The paper discusses PyLate, a library that simplifies working with multi-vector neural ranking architectures like ColBERT, addressing the challenges faced by single-vector representations in retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ranking systems, while effective, suffer from compression issues in single-vector representations, particularly in complex or out-of-domain tasks. The authors aim to address the underutilization of multi-vector methods due to a lack of practical tools.

Method: The authors introduced PyLate, a library built on Sentence Transformers, to provide a modular and accessible framework for multi-vector modeling. It integrates features like efficient training, logging, model card generation, and multi-vector-specific indexing.

Result: PyLate was successfully used to develop state-of-the-art models like GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, showcasing its utility in both research and production contexts.

Conclusion: PyLate bridges the gap in practical tools for late interaction models, facilitating their adoption and advancing the field of information retrieval.

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Foundation-Expert Paradigm to overcome scaling challenges in hyperscale recommendation models. It demonstrates improved system efficiency and performance via a production-grade infrastructure called HyperCast, deployed at Meta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unique challenges of hyperscale recommender systems, including shifting data distributions, diversity in tasks, stringent latency, and computational constraints, to benefit from scaling laws as seen in other fields like NLP and CV.

Method: Develop the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: train a central FM on diverse, lifelong user data to generalize knowledge and transfer it to lightweight, surface-specific expert models through target-aware embeddings. Create and deploy HyperCast infrastructure to support this framework.

Result: The deployment of this approach at Meta serves tens of billions of user requests daily. It improves online metrics compared to Meta's prior one-stage production system, enhances developer velocity, and maintains infrastructure efficiency.

Conclusion: The Foundation-Expert Paradigm demonstrates a scalable, compute-efficient method for implementing hyperscale recommendation models. Its successful deployment provides a blueprint for enabling scaling laws in this domain.

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

Motivation: Bank supervisors need tools to draft measures that align with historical precedents, ensuring consistency and effectiveness in regulatory practices.

Method: The system combines lexical, semantic, and CRR fuzzy set matching techniques. Validation is performed using Monte Carlo methods and optimized through a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder.

Result: The system achieves high performance metrics, with Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92, outperforming standalone lexical and semantic models like BM25 and BERT.

Conclusion: The IR system demonstrates robustness and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for drafting consistent and informed measures in the banking sector.

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recommender systems by reducing model complexity and optimizing beyond-accuracy aspects like efficiency, inspired by multimodal learning methodologies.

Method: The study proposes CoBraR, a system using weight sharing between neural networks of user and item representations in a joint embedding space.

Result: Experiments in e-commerce and movie recommendation demonstrate CoBraR reduces parameters and enhances beyond-accuracy metrics while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework CoBraR is effective and extensible for real-world recommendation scenarios, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide sellers at eBay with relevant keyphrase recommendations that align with seller and search judgments, avoiding irrelevant results in advertising campaigns.

Method: A novel two-step LLM distillation process, using a cross-encoder assistant and multi-task training, is introduced to train a bi-encoder student for relevant keyphrase retrieval.

Result: The incorporation of LLM-based knowledge distillation in the training framework improved the performance of bi-encoders for retrieving relevant keyphrases for eBay advertisers.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-assisted distillation approach effectively debiases retrieval models and enhances the relevance of keyphrase recommendations for eBay sellers.

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Method: The approach uses LightGBM ensemble model trained on three types of features: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and contextual data. Monotonicity constraints and content-based item embeddings address cold-start problems. Techniques for unbiased sampling and bootstrapping handle data scarcity and visibility bias.

Result: A/B testing involving 5-10% of iFood user base showed 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based methods.

Conclusion: RED system is a novel and impactful solution for recommending curated food collections, showcasing effectiveness through real-world metrics and deployment. Its methodologies are highly scalable and transferable to similar dynamic environments.

Abstract: Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast
catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper
presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin
America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the
selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our
approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three
feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

### [408] [SecoustiCodec: Cross-Modal Aligned Streaming Single-Codecbook Speech Codec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02849)
*Chunyu Qiang,Haoyu Wang,Cheng Gong,Tianrui Wang,Ruibo Fu,Tao Wang,Ruilong Chen,Jiangyan Yi,Zhengqi Wen,Chen Zhang,Longbiao Wang,Jianwu Dang,Jianhua Tao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SecoustiCodec is a low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information, boasting SOTA reconstruction quality (PESQ scores at 0.27/1 kbps).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech codecs struggle with semantic encoding challenges such as residual paralinguistic information, insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of streaming support.

Method: SecoustiCodec employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) with finite scalar quantization (FSQ) for efficient quantization, contrastive learning for semantic disentanglement, and an acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization for model convergence.

Result: SecoustiCodec separates semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space, achieving superior semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity with SOTA PESQ scores of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.

Conclusion: SecoustiCodec addresses key limitations of prior codecs and provides a robust, streaming-compatible solution for unifying speech and text language models. Code and model weights are open-sourced.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language
models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding,
such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion),
insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack
of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose
SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that
disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook
space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity,
paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between
semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method
based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is
proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens
while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method
based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a
joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic
information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage
optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.
Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA
(state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.
The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the
completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo,
code, and model weights.

### [409] [PatchDSU: Uncertainty Modeling for Out of Distribution Generalization in Keyword Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03190)
*Bronya Roni Chernyak,Yael Segal,Yosi Shrem,Joseph Keshet*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces PatchDSU, an extension of DSU, to address distribution shifts in speech data for keyword spotting tasks. It outperforms other methods in multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech systems often face distribution shifts due to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker variability, yet deep learning models assume consistent data distribution.

Method: PatchDSU splits input spectrograms into patches and applies separate DSU-based augmentations to address out-of-domain generalization issues effectively.

Result: Evaluations on datasets like Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM, under different noise conditions, showed that PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods with PatchDSU being more consistent.

Conclusion: PatchDSU effectively tackles out-of-distribution challenges in speech keyword spotting tasks and demonstrates consistent improvements across various test scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel at many tasks but rely on the assumption that
training and test data follow the same distribution. This assumption often does
not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due
to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.
  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each
neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the
problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled
features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying
DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static
visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram
- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a
simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics
when applied to the entire input.
  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose
PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and
independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside
other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.
Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music
noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing
model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,
both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods. Notably, PatchDSU demonstrates
more consistent improvements across the evaluated scenarios compared to other
approaches.

*Vinil Polepalli*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework using class-conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) to generate synthetic RNA-Seq data for pan-cancer classification, significantly improving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pan-cancer transcriptomic classification faces challenges due to high dimensionality and limited data, crucial for tumor subtyping and therapy selection.

Method: The study uses feature selection to reduce genes, trains a cVAE for generating synthetic gene expression data, and augments the dataset to train a multilayer perceptron classifier.

Result: The augmented model achieved high classification accuracy (~98%) on test data, outperforming models trained on the original dataset alone, especially for underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: cVAE-based data augmentation significantly enhances pan-cancer classification accuracy, offering potential for better tumor subtyping and handling class imbalance issues effectively.

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform
tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high
dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)
to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using
801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression
features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on
this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on
cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for
each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples
(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A
two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the
augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high
classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially
outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present
detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier
performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture
diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based
synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction
performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered system to evaluate teaching effectiveness at scale using large language models (LLMs) for qualitative student feedback analysis, emphasizing ethical safeguards and transparent governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in evaluating teaching effectiveness in large universities, particularly in engineering programs with massive student enrollment, where traditional methods are unscalable and inconsistent.

Method: A scalable framework uses LLMs for hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling in processing qualitative feedback. It incorporates visual analytics for contextualizing numeric data and involves diverse inputs from students, peers, and self-reflective evaluations.

Result: The system was successfully deployed in a large college of engineering, with preliminary validation showing that LLM-generated summaries align well with human reviewers and support professional development.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI systems, designed with transparency and ethical governance, can effectively enhance teaching evaluation and foster continuous improvement at scale.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the transformation of residential property valuation due to the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6 regulation and AI advancement, proposing human-AI collaborative frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies, biases, and inconsistencies in residential property valuation by leveraging regulatory standardization and advancements in AI technologies.

Method: The paper develops a three-layer framework integrating AI for physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning, while addressing regulatory and trust requirements.

Result: The study shows that combining AI capabilities with regulatory standardization can restructure the market, enhancing professional efficiency and reducing systemic risks.

Conclusion: Successful transformation in real estate valuation requires collaboration between humans and AI, augmenting professional expertise while correcting biases and ensuring fairness.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

*Yonathan A. Arbel*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can predict human reasonableness judgments in legal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if AI systems can align with human intuitions and reasonableness judgments in legal decision-making.

Method: Randomized controlled trials were conducted, comparing human judgments and LLM predictions across over 10,000 simulated legal scenarios.

Result: Certain LLMs captured patterns resembling human decisional frameworks and prioritized social cues over economic efficiency, similar to human behaviors.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for practical applications in law, policy testing, and improving decision-making systems, especially as AI becomes more autonomous in ethical judgments.

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that
determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments
challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader
societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs)
can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across
multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate
that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially
their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize
social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring
human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate
intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy
interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument
reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions,
understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks
becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Motivation: To understand how AI agents can transform decentralized ecosystems by integrating into various aspects of Web3 technologies.

Method: The authors analyze 133 projects and categorize them into a taxonomy, then explore four key integrations related to decentralized finance, governance, security, and reliability using Web3 infrastructure.

Result: Identified distinct market patterns, key integration frameworks between Web3 and AI agents, and foundational challenges such as scalability, security, and ethics.

Conclusion: Future research should address scalability, security, and ethical issues to enable robust and trustworthy AI-augmented decentralized systems.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly
evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper
presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between
Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics,
governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing
projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market
landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and
capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key
integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing
decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3
governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via
intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing
(RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent
operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By
synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight
foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and
outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust,

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing AI's societal impact through the lens of freedom, complementing current risk-focused approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI regulation predominantly focuses on mitigating risks, but lacks systematic frameworks to assess AI's broader societal impact.

Method: The paper introduces a proto-framework based on Kantian philosophy, focusing on two dimensions of freedom: capability and opportunity, mapped against the Sustainable Development Goals.

Result: The framework provides a systematic approach to examine AI's societal impact, integrating considerations of freedom with current AI risk assessment paradigms.

Conclusion: By operationalising the concept of freedom in AI regulation, the framework offers a complementary perspective to existing risk-based regulatory approaches, enhancing policymaking tools.

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm,
with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus
is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration
of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing
the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom.
This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised
framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy
and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the
counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are
developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.
These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that
systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable
Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based
approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept
of freedom in AI regulation.

### [417] [Quantum Neural Network applications to Protein Binding Affinity Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03446)
*Erico Souza Teixeira,Lucas Barros Fernandes,Yara Rodrigues Inácio*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This study explores predicting protein binding energy using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and finds they can achieve higher accuracy on one unseen dataset while being significantly faster to train compared to classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting protein binding energy is essential for applications in fields like drug development and vaccine design. The study seeks to evaluate Quantum Neural Networks as an alternative to traditional machine learning methods that rely on classical computing.

Method: The study proposed 30 variations of QNNs based on multilayer perceptron architecture, using 3 distinct architectures and 10 quantum circuits per architecture. Their performance was compared to a classical artificial neural network using accuracy and training time as benchmarks. Testing involved one primary training dataset and two unseen datasets for validation.

Result: QNNs achieved ~20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset but underperformed on others. However, their training times were notably faster by several orders of magnitude compared to classical models.

Conclusion: While QNNs demonstrate potential with faster training and accuracy gains on some datasets, their inconsistent performance across datasets suggests the need for further optimization and research to fully realize their benefits in protein binding energy prediction.

Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular
interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the
natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine
design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have
been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental
techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making
significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has
demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of
quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,
raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding
energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of
QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer
perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct
architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure
their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with
that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial
neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset
was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen
samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models
achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although
their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models
exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their
classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein
binding energy prediction.

*Hengxin Ruan,Qiufan Lin,Shupei Chen,Yang Wang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capability of generative models to preserve detailed physical information, like spectroscopic redshift, in galaxy image translation, using various deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance galaxy image translation by preserving complex high-order physical information, which goes beyond conventional pixel-level and morphology-level statistics.

Method: Testing four generative models (Swin Transformer, SRGAN, capsule network, diffusion model) on SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images to assess their ability to retain redshift information.

Result: The models perform differently in retaining high-order redshift information while roughly reproducing morphology-level statistics, but they exhibit uncertainties in preserving cross-band peak flux data.

Conclusion: Though imperfect, the translated images hold substantial promise for applications where extreme image fidelity is not critical, and the study offers insights for improving image translation models for scientific research.

Abstract: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and
cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has
been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information
extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly
detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the
pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack
of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical
information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely
on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the
effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical
information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and
morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin
Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS
and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of
incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures
of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In
particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain
meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable
uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to
the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images
may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise
for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly
required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical
information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the
development of image translation models for scientific use.

*Junle Liu,Chang Liu,Yanyu Ke,Wenliang Chen,Kihing Shum,K. T. Tse,Gang Hu*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper presents a "DeepUFNet" model for accurately forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure on a rectangular cylinder, combining UNet and Fourier neural networks with a high-frequency physical loss control parameter ($\beta$). The model achieved high prediction accuracy and is validated using wind tunnel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spatiotemporal wall pressure is crucial for analyzing forces and structural response in fluid mechanics. However, existing deep learning models are insufficient for this due to limitations in handling spatiotemporal predictions.

Method: Proposes a "DeepUFNet" model integrating UNet and Fourier neural networks. The model includes high-frequency loss control during training, with parameter $\beta$ dynamically adjusted. Winds tunnel tests provide training and testing data.

Result: DeepUFNet accurately forecasts spatiotemporal wall pressure. Forecast results align with experimental data across statistical, temporal, spectral, and spatial metrics. The high-frequency loss control substantially enhances performance.

Conclusion: DeepUFNet is effective for spatiotemporal wall pressure forecasting, particularly at high-frequency variations. It also demonstrates strong extrapolation ability with limited spatial data.

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and
structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the
potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients
and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning
frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial
information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a
rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural
Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure
and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control
embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the
parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind
tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional
rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero
using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for
DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast
spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison
between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in
statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,
spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that
embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the
DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting
spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting
high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the
DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information
input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Tong Yu,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: AgentSight is an open-source observability framework that bridges the semantic gap in LLM agents by correlating their high-level intents with low-level actions using boundary tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on LLM agents for software development and maintenance presents challenges in monitoring and debugging these fundamentally non-deterministic systems.

Method: AgentSight uses boundary tracing with eBPF to intercept and analyze LLM traffic and kernel events while causally correlating these data streams without modifying application code.

Result: AgentSight effectively detects issues like prompt injection attacks, resource-intensive loops, and coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems with minimal performance overhead.

Conclusion: AgentSight provides a framework-agnostic solution that enhances observability in LLM-based software, addressing critical semantic gaps for improved debugging and monitoring.

Abstract: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for
development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these
AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing
a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates
a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level
intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but
cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to
distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.
We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this
semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors
agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using
eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic

### [421] [MaLV-OS: Rethinking the Operating System Architecture for Machine Learning in Virtualized Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03676)
*Stella Bitchebe,Oana Balmau*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper proposes using the operating system (OS) to improve machine learning (ML) performance, introducing a specialized OS architecture called MaLV-OS tailored for virtualized ML workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many studies have used ML to enhance OS and kernel decision-making, the reverse approach—leveraging OS to optimize ML—has not been explored. The authors aim to fill this gap and create an ML-specialized operating system.

Method: The authors propose MaLV-OS, an OS architecture featuring a micro-kernel, Micro-LAKE, for GPU and system optimization, an MLaaS subsystem for memory management and CPU scheduling, and GPU virtualization integrated into the hypervisor. It allows dynamic policy selection and modular kernel expansion.

Result: MaLV-OS offloads complexity from ML models to the OS, enables faster execution, streamlines programming, and provides flexible, dynamic improvements tailored to specific ML workloads, especially in virtualized clouds.

Conclusion: MaLV-OS innovates by redesigning the OS to adapt and optimize for ML workloads, offering a promising avenue to enhance ML execution environments in virtualized settings.

Abstract: A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop
learned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to
the job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network
bandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has
in common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and
to the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,
using OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level
optimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML
context. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this
paper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and
algorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS
rethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,
especially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML
applications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,
Micro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an
MLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE
with memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads
system-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity
and programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an
open-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.
For more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to
dynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model
the user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the
MaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the
MLaaS subsystem.

### [422] [Who Gets Cited? Gender- and Majority-Bias in LLM-Driven Reference Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02740)
*Jiangen He*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: This study explores gender bias in reference selection by large language models (LLMs) and identifies persistent male preference and majority-group bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs introduce gender bias in citation workflows, particularly as they are increasingly adopted for academic purposes.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments using pseudonymous author names across different LLMs and evaluated bias patterns in varying gender composition and scientific fields.

Result: LLMs showed a male-authored reference preference and majority-group bias, amplified in large candidate pools, and inconsistencies across scientific domains.

Conclusion: LLMs may reinforce gender disparities in scholarly recognition, highlighting the need for effective mitigation strategies before widespread academic implementation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research
assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,
yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation
workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven
reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author
names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude
Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and
analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of
bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group
bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.
These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly
attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis
indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social
sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce
or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective
mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender
disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into
high-stakes academic workflows.

*Yu Shi,Zongliang Fu,Shuo Chen,Bohan Zhao,Wei Xu,Changshui Zhang,Jian Li*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: Kronos is a pre-training framework for financial time-series data (K-line), demonstrating significant improvements in downstream tasks like volatility prediction and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) struggle with financial candlestick (K-line) data and neglect critical tasks such as volatility prediction, prompting the need for a specialized model.

Method: The paper introduces Kronos, a framework using a customized tokenizer to encode market dynamics and train with an autoregressive objective on a multi-market dataset of over 12 billion K-line records.

Result: Kronos improves forecasting accuracy by 93% against top TSFMs and 87% over traditional models, reduces volatility prediction errors by 9%, and enhances synthetic data generation fidelity by 22%.

Conclusion: Kronos establishes itself as a powerful and versatile model for financial time-series analysis with superior zero-shot performance in key financial tasks.

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large
Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation
Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line)
data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures.
Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as
volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these
limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework
tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized
tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,
preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos
using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12
billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced
temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting
across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts
price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the
best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility
forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line
sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation
model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is
publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: CTBench is the first benchmark designed to assess time series generation methods specifically for the cryptocurrency market, addressing gaps in forecasting accuracy, trading performance, and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSG methods struggle to address the unique challenges of cryptocurrency markets, such as high volatility and regime shifts, which limits their effectiveness in crypto-specific applications.

Method: CTBench evaluates TSG models using 452 crypto tokens across 13 metrics in forecasting accuracy, trading performance, and more. It introduces dual evaluation tasks for predictive utility and statistical arbitrage.

Result: CTBench benchmarks eight models, revealing trade-offs between statistical accuracy and real-world profitability under different cryptocurrency market regimes.

Conclusion: CTBench provides critical evaluations and guidance for selecting TSG models, enhancing analytical and trading strategy applications in cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress
testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in
cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and
rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and
benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work
(1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses
narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific
complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for
trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the
first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain.
\textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates
TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy,
rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational
efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the
\emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves
temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the
\emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support
mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models
from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering
trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably,
\textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for
selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy
development.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: A comparison of six models (classical, deep learning, and quantum) for DeFi yield forecasting shows that classical models like XGBoost and Random Forest outperform quantum and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for accurate yield and performance forecasting in decentralized finance (DeFi) for better liquidity allocation.

Method: The study benchmarks six models using one year of historical data from 28 Curve Finance pools and evaluates their performance using test MAE, RMSE, and directional accuracy.

Result: Classical ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve the best performance with directional accuracy over 71%, while quantum models significantly underperform.

Conclusion: Classical models remain more robust and suitable for DeFi applications compared to emerging quantum approaches, which face performance limitations with real-world time series data.

Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for
accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation
strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest,
LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector
machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data
from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE,
and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models,
particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep
learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy
(71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test
MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with
directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current
limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series
data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into
model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of
classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.

### [427] [Evaluating Transfer Learning Methods on Real-World Data Streams: A Case Study in Financial Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02702)
*Ricardo Ribeiro Pereira,Jacopo Bono,Hugo Ferreira,Pedro Ribeiro,Carlos Soares,Pedro Bizarro*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to simulate dynamic data availability scenarios for realistic evaluation of transfer learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unrealistic static assumptions in transfer learning methods regarding the availability of target domain data, which can vary significantly over time in real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed a data manipulation framework that simulates dynamic data scenarios, creates domain variations through resampling, and applies transformations like covariate and concept shifts.

Result: The framework was applied to a proprietary card payment dataset and a publicly available fraud dataset, showing its utility in simulating realistic experimental conditions and enabling comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework supports better understanding of TL models' behavior in dynamic settings, aiding improved decision-making for deploying models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning
(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before
deploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically
designed with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled
and unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world
applications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies
over time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed
under the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to
unrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.
To support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and
models, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying
data availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through
resampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by
applying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of
potentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities
enable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,
in turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms
when deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite
of card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we
also illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account
Fraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over
time and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates
understanding of the behavior of models and algorithms. This leads to better
decision making when deploying models for new domains in real-world
environments.

### [428] [Beyond the Wavefunction: Qualia Abstraction Language Mechanics and the Grammar of Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02755)
*Mikołaj Sienicki,Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: physics.hist-ph

TL;DR: The authors propose a novel framework called Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) to model quantum mechanics based on subjective experiences rather than traditional mathematical abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantum mechanics relies heavily on external mathematical abstractions such as Hilbert space, which are disconnected from subjective experiences. The paper aims to address this and reframe quantum phenomena using the dynamics of subjective introspection.

Method: The proposed framework, QAL, conceptualizes physical systems as streams of introspective units which are structured sequences of modality, shape, and functional effect. Key quantum notions, such as superposition, collapse, and entanglement, are reinterpreted from this subjective perspective.

Result: QAL provides new interpretations for established quantum mechanics concepts, embedding the observer within the framework. It aligns with endophysical approaches and suggests modeling quantum phenomena with a vocabulary for first-person structure.

Conclusion: QAL transitions quantum mechanics into a post-Platonist, introspection-based model, offering fresh theoretical insights and resolving the observer paradox linguistically rather than ontologically.

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in
external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of
subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical
systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of
modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert
space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a
form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective
contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams
of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight
theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics
reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a
formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a
vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within
the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We
analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with
standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a
post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

*Hagai Rappeport,Mor Nitzan*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: The paper explores a mathematical link between evolution and learning, proposing that organism complexity adapts to environmental complexity, governed by principles akin to Bayesian learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the relationship between organismal complexity and environmental complexity, by utilizing the parallels between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory.

Method: The study identifies a mathematical analogy between evolutionary dynamics (replicator equation) and Bayesian learning, applying established learning principles to predict organismal complexity trends.

Result: The analysis suggests that organism complexity evolves to align with environmental complexity, with overly simplistic or overly complex organisms being less fit. Rapidly changing environments may reduce selected complexity.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into how optimal organism complexity is influenced by environmental factors and demonstrates a framework with implications for both evolution and learning fields.

Abstract: A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an
increase in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of
complexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,
where complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal
complexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a
mathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal
complexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical
isomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between
the replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types
corresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to
likelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization
prevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity
matches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over
to the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity
evolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too
simple organisms suffering from \textit{overfitness} and \textit{underfitness},
respectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal
additional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments
decrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both
evolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between
over-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient
flexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of
optimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers
new ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential
causes for it to increase or decrease in different environments.

*Phuc Hao Do,Tran Duc Le*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a genetic algorithm coupled with the Poliastro library to find optimal orbital transfer trajectories, showcasing its efficacy in minimizing fuel usage for specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance orbital maneuver planning by providing a framework capable of solving fuel-efficient trajectory optimization problems beyond classical analytical methods.

Method: The study couples a Genetic Algorithm with the Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously compute optimal three-impulse trajectories between coplanar circular orbits.

Result: The GA accurately reproduces solutions like the Hohmann transfer for LEO-GEO transitions and optimizes high-energy transfers with significant fuel savings, although the latter imposes enormous mission duration increases.

Conclusion: The combination of evolutionary algorithms and open-source libraries proves robust for astrodynamics optimization, allowing rapid prototyping and detailed trade-off analysis in orbital maneuver design.

Abstract: Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at
minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total
velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and
Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack
the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a
computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the
Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal,
three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We
validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer
from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy
transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results
demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO
transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer,
achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's
accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a
superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of
213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however,
necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1
day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful
toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how
combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust
method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their
critical design trade-offs.

patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant
findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a
nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the
potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply
community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters
partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of

### [432] [Accelerating Conjugate Gradient Solvers for Homogenization Problems with Unitary Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02681)
*Julius Herb,Felix Fritzen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces UNO-CG, a hybrid solver accelerating conjugate gradient solvers with machine-learned preconditioners for parametric PDEs. It delivers efficient solutions while ensuring accuracy and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for rapid and reliable solvers for parametric PDEs, especially in areas like material design and homogenization problems. Classical solvers are accurate but computationally expensive, while machine learning approaches lack guaranteed accuracy. This paper seeks to develop a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both.

Method: The authors proposed UNO-CG, which combines conjugate gradient solvers with Unitary Neural Operators as machine-learned preconditioners. This hybrid approach is designed to optimize iterative solver performance by data-driven discovery of Green's functions.

Result: UNO-CG was evaluated on homogenization problems with heterogeneous microstructures. It reduced the number of solver iterations significantly and performed competitively with expert-designed preconditioners, showing versatility across various boundary conditions.

Conclusion: UNO-CG successfully achieves faster computation for PDEs with ensured convergence and versatility. It demonstrates the potential to solve homogenization problems effectively, even outperforming specialized solvers in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations
(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,
there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with
heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their
behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for
a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical
numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid
theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence
remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging
as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed
accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is
possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both
data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce
UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using
specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence
by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a
modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a
data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate
iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems
involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our
results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number
of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for
homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG
maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where
many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and
robustness.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores an adaptive knowledge distillation (KD) method to improve device-directed speech detection (DDSD). It leverages an ASR pre-trained acoustic encoder with task-specific adapters to achieve better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the accuracy of DDSD, which is crucial for naturalistic user experience with voice assistants, while maintaining efficiency in deployment.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive KD framework using a large pre-trained ASR acoustic encoder as a "teacher." Task-specific adapters are trained alongside the student model, while the teacher encoder remains frozen.

Result: The adaptive KD method significantly improves DDSD performance by +26% and +19% Equal Error Rate reductions for keyword and keyword-free tasks, respectively.

Conclusion: Adaptive KD not only enhances DDSD accuracy but also shows robustness across different model architectures, such as transformers and conformers.

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that
separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech
or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user
experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD
accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a
novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations
of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific
adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the
student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms
the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free
(follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal
Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across
the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

Motivation: To improve the target speech extraction (TSE) process by integrating human feedback to enhance specific segments without altering unmarked areas.

Method: Synthetic datasets simulating human-marked errors were generated via automated masking functions. Models were trained on these datasets, particularly focusing on noise power-based masking and probabilistic thresholding.

Result: Performance evaluations showed that noise power-based masking and probabilistic thresholding aligned strongly with human annotations, and users preferred refined outputs over baseline TSE in a study.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop refinement is an effective approach for enhancing the performance of neural speech extraction systems.

Abstract: We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses
human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark
specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement
system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions.
Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we
generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train
models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based
masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with
human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference
for refined outputs over baseline TSE. Our findings demonstrate that
human-in-the-loop refinement is a promising approach for improving the
performance of neural speech extraction.

*Jingyi Chen,Ju Seung Byun,Micha Elsner,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework, to improve TTS diffusion models’ efficiency and audio quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS diffusion models produce high-quality speech but face inefficiencies in real-time scenarios and issues in intonation and rhythm modeling.

Method: DLPO integrates reinforcement learning with the model's original training loss and uses human feedback scores to align structure and rewards.

Result: Applying DLPO to the WaveGrad 2 model showed significant objective and subjective improvements in speech quality and naturalness.

Conclusion: The study highlights DLPO's capability to produce high-quality and efficient TTS, making it suitable for real-time, resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for
real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation
and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy
Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO
integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving
generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores
as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's
structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a
non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant
improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective
evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings
demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in
real-time, resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-MLPNet, a speech separation model that operates in real-time on low-power neural accelerators for hearable devices, with superior performance compared to previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time speech separation and extraction on low-power neural accelerators for hearable devices, overcoming the limitations of existing speech separation models on these platforms.

Method: TF-MLPNet processes audio in the time-frequency domain using a combination of fully connected and convolutional layers. The model applies mixed-precision quantization-aware training for efficient performance.

Result: TF-MLPNet achieves real-time processing of 6 ms audio chunks on the GAP9 processor with a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared to prior models.

Conclusion: TF-MLPNet enables efficient, real-time speech separation for hearable devices, making it a breakthrough for augmented and enhanced hearing applications.

Abstract: Speech separation on hearable devices can enable transformative augmented and
enhanced hearing capabilities. However, state-of-the-art speech separation
networks cannot run in real-time on tiny, low-power neural accelerators
designed for hearables, due to their limited compute capabilities. We present
TF-MLPNet, the first speech separation network capable of running in real-time
on such low-power accelerators while outperforming existing streaming models
for blind speech separation and target speech extraction. Our network operates
in the time-frequency domain, processing frequency sequences with stacks of
fully connected layers that alternate along the channel and frequency
dimensions, and independently processing the time sequence at each frequency
bin using convolutional layers. Results show that our mixed-precision
quantization-aware trained (QAT) model can process 6 ms audio chunks in
real-time on the GAP9 processor, achieving a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared
to prior speech separation models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces WhisperInject, an adversarial framework to manipulate audio-based language models through imperceptible perturbations embedded in audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing use of audio interfaces for human-AI interactions, which creates vulnerabilities for adversarial attacks.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage framework: (1) RL-PGD for guiding models to override safety protocols and (2) PGD for embedding subtle perturbations into benign audio.

Result: Experiments showed a 86%+ success rate across several state-of-the-art audio language models under rigorous evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: WhisperInject reveals practical and covert audio-native threats, showcasing that audio-driven models can be exploited via sophisticated adversarial attacks.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life,
audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this
convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential
attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a
two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate
state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method
uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human
listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,
Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the
target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native
responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,
Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize
subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as
weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous
StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation
framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across
Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a
new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical
exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

*Jan Melechovsky,Ambuj Mehrish,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicMaster is a generative model designed to restore and master music audio quality issues, guided by text-based instructions or automatic mode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio recordings often suffer from various quality issues, especially in non-professional settings. Current tools require manual and separate adjustments, prompting the need for a unified solution.

Method: The model uses a flow-matching generative paradigm and is trained on the SonicMaster dataset, which includes degraded and high-quality audio tracks simulated using nineteen degradation functions across five enhancement categories.

Result: SonicMaster significantly improves audio quality across all artifact categories, validated by both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

Conclusion: The study confirms SonicMaster as an effective unified generative model for music restoration and mastering, improving audio quality in a streamlined and user-controlled manner.

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive
reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo
image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized
equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate
specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce
SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and
mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based
control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply
targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general
restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large
dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common
degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five
enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our
approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an
audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered
versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate
that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact
categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners
prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio,
highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

*Tianxin Xie,Shan Yang,Chenxing Li,Dong Yu,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: EmoSteer-TTS introduces a training-free approach for fine-grained emotion control in TTS models by steering internal activations, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS systems lack accessible and stable fine-grained emotion control and rely on extensive, high-quality datasets.

Method: The paper proposes modifying subsets of internal activations within a pretrained flow matching-based TTS model through activation steering. An algorithm is developed for activation extraction, searching emotional tokens, and inference-time adjustments.

Result: EmoSteer-TTS demonstrates fine-grained, continuous, and interpretable emotion control, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a novel training-free mechanism for continuous fine-grained emotion manipulation in diverse pretrained TTS models, advancing emotional speech synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most
existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via
discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text
prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or
unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for
training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel
training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control
(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first
empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within
a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of
synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free
and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token
searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into
a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In
addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated
emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and
continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art
(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves
training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

*Kirill Sokolov,Alexander Korotin*

TL;DR: The paper investigates the convergence of the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm in the discrete-time Schrödinger bridge problem, showing it converges exponentially with a measurable contraction factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in understanding the speed of convergence of the IMF algorithm, despite its known convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Method: Analyzed the IMF algorithm in the context of the discrete-time Schrödinger bridge problem, establishing its exponential convergence and deriving an explicit contraction factor.

Result: Proved that IMF exhibits exponential convergence and quantified the contraction factor for the first time.

Conclusion: This study provides a rigorous quantification of IMF's convergence rate, advancing the theoretical understanding of its performance in solving the Schrödinger bridge problem.

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state
space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF)
algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth
solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we
establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an
explicit contraction factor.

*Shreya Meel,Mohamed Nomeir,Pasan Dissanayake,Sanghamitra Dutta,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a privacy-preserving framework for counterfactual explanation retrieval in machine learning applications, addressing user privacy concerns while retrieving actionable and nearest neighbor counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stake applications using machine learning demand transparency and explainability, such as providing counterfactual explanations, which can also pose privacy threats to users and institutions involved.

Method: The paper proposes various privacy-preserving schemes for counterfactual retrieval, namely PCR and I-PCR, ensuring information-theoretic user privacy and varying degrees of database privacy, along with accommodating users' preferences for tailored explanations.

Result: The framework theoretically achieves perfect user privacy while retrieving nearest counterfactuals from an institutional database, with numerical results comparing database leakage across different schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes effectively address privacy concerns for both users and institutions while enabling actionable and nearest neighbor counterfactual explanations in high-stake machine learning applications.

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

TL;DR: Morphlux is a new optical interconnect fabric for accelerators like GPUs/TPUs that improves performance within compute servers, addressing limitations with traditional electrical interconnects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the interconnect bandwidth wall due to the faster scaling of accelerator FLOPS compared to interconnect bandwidth, which causes under-utilization of GPU resources in cloud data centers.

Method: Developed Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, along with a novel end-to-end hardware prototype to interconnect accelerators in servers.

Result: Morphlux enhances tenant compute bandwidth by up to 66%, reduces fragmentation by 70%, increases ML model training throughput by 1.72x, and provides rapid fault recovery by replacing failed accelerators in 1.2 seconds.

Conclusion: Morphlux demonstrates that using programmable photonic interconnects in compute servers can significantly improve resource utilization and ML performance over traditional electrical interconnects.

Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute
servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In
contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are
workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in
the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall
caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the
interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to
under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop
Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect
accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic
ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant
compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.
We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate
these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training
throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our
hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in
1.2 seconds.

TL;DR: This study explores the real-world application of 5G non-standalone networks in supporting cloud-based execution of vehicle functions. Tests analyzed performance aspects like latency and packet delivery along various environmental routes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess 5G non-standalone networks' practical capabilities for resource-intensive vehicle functions, which are less studied compared to theoretical evaluations.

Method: The authors tested two AI algorithms (emotion and object recognition) over 8.8 km in varied terrain while analyzing deployments across cloudlets and traditional cloud platforms.

Result: Findings showed 84% average signal quality, less than 0.1% Packet Error Rate, varying transfer times based on location, hardware-driven processing times, and critical round trip time thresholds (>150ms) for cloud offloading suitability.

Conclusion: Cloud offloading on 5G non-standalone networks is viable but faces performance variations due to geographical and infrastructure factors, emphasizing latency as a key determinant.

Abstract: Cloud-based offloading helps address energy consumption and performance
challenges in executing resource-intensive vehicle algorithms. Utilizing 5G,
with its low latency and high bandwidth, enables seamless vehicle-to-cloud
integration. Currently, only non-standalone 5G is publicly available, and
real-world applications remain underexplored compared to theoretical studies.
This paper evaluates 5G non-standalone networks for cloud execution of vehicle
functions, focusing on latency, Round Trip Time, and packet delivery. Tests
used two AI-based algorithms -- emotion recognition and object recognition --
along an 8.8 km route in Baden-W\"urttemberg, Germany, encompassing urban,
rural, and forested areas. Two platforms were analyzed: a cloudlet in Frankfurt
and a cloud in Mannheim, employing various deployment strategies like
conventional applications and containerized and container-orchestrated setups.
Key findings highlight an average signal quality of 84 %, with no connectivity
interruptions despite minor drops in built-up areas. Packet analysis revealed a
Packet Error Rate below 0.1 % for both algorithms. Transfer times varied
significantly depending on the geographical location and the backend servers'
network connections, while processing times were mainly influenced by the
computation hardware in use. Additionally, cloud offloading seems only be a
suitable option, when a round trip time of more than 150 ms is possible.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift
from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems
requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability
verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol
environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the
fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and

cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and
cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol
(MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS
communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles,
extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous
agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks,
and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control
(AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational
autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents
into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent
services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of static communication endpoints in distributed AI environments, aiming to improve adaptability and scalability of agent interactions.

Method: Agents advertise context and requirements through Agent Fact cards in a registry, enabling real-time resolution based on factors like location, load, and security via tailored communication channels.

Result: AdaptiveResolver facilitates context-aware, scalable, and secure agent-to-agent communication by surpassing traditional static models.

Conclusion: This architecture offers a flexible and future-proof solution capable of adapting to increasing complexity in AI interaction ecosystems.

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address
the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs,
AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication
endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent
capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and
context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A
requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester
Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication
channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.
The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and
resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable
agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.
AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent
communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuroSync, a system to optimize user-LLM interactions by matching intents directly to coding tasks, addressing misalignments and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of misalignment between user intent and generated code faced by domain users without programming expertise.

Method: The authors propose direct intent-task matching and implement it in NeuroSync using a knowledge distillation pipeline and interactive visualizations.

Result: NeuroSync improved intent-task alignment, reduced cognitive load, and increased coding efficiency as validated through technical experiments and a user study (N=12).

Conclusion: NeuroSync demonstrates the potential to enhance the usability and accuracy of conversational LLM systems for domain users by minimizing misalignments.

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

Abstract: Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in
human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the
AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based
on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when
to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved.
We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher
confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a
representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the
inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy
is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI
agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and
the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence
calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing
poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the
team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good
metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the
first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI
inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.

*Pragya Singh,Ankush Gupta,Mohan Kumar,Pushpendra Singh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in collecting authentic emotion data in real-world settings for AI and introduces a framework called AnnoSense to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve emotion AI algorithms by addressing the challenges in collecting high-quality, real-world emotion data and annotations.

Method: The study involved 75 survey responses, 32 interviews with the general public, and 3 focus group discussions with 12 mental health professionals. Insights from 119 stakeholders informed the creation of the AnnoSense framework, which was later evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts.

Result: The AnnoSense framework was developed and evaluated, receiving feedback from experts about its clarity, usefulness, and adaptability.

Conclusion: AnnoSense has the potential to improve real-world emotion data collection and analysis, progressively advancing emotion AI research and applications.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

### [451] [Real-World Receptivity to Adaptive Mental Health Interventions: Findings from an In-the-Wild Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02817)
*Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Aditya Sneh,Snehil Gupta,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study investigates user receptivity components (acceptance and feasibility) to mental health interventions delivered via a custom smartphone app that uses reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding how users engage with mental health interventions delivered via mHealth platforms and optimize receptivity.

Method: Conducted a two-week study with 70 students using a custom app (LogMe) that collected passive and active data; interventions were delivered using a reinforcement learning algorithm (Thompson Sampling).

Result: Passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity to mental health interventions. An adaptive reinforcement learning approach optimized intervention delivery.

Conclusion: Results provide insights for designing context-aware, adaptive mental health interventions that maximize user engagement and are actionable in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

*Sangho Suh,Michael Lai,Kevin Pu,Steven P. Dow,Tovi Grossman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces StoryEnsemble, an AI-integrated tool designed to support dynamic exploration and iterative design processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design processes often face constraints, limiting exploration, feedback, and revisiting assumptions, which complicates adherence to core design principles.

Method: The authors conducted a formative study with 15 participants to identify challenges and developed StoryEnsemble, an AI tool using forward and backward propagation in a node-link interface. They tested the tool in a user study with 10 participants.

Result: StoryEnsemble enables rapid and multi-directional iteration, allowing flexible navigation between design stages, as demonstrated by the user study.

Conclusion: AI tools like StoryEnsemble can enhance iterative design practices by improving fluidity, accessibility, and engagement in exploration and iteration.

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Navigation Pixie, an adaptive navigation agent for the commercial metaverse, enhancing user exploration via integrated spatial metadata and LLM-based processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic navigation assistance in commercial metaverse platforms while overcoming platform constraints.

Method: A loosely coupled architecture was used, integrating structured spatial metadata and LLM-powered NLP, tested across PC and VR environments.

Result: Navigation Pixie improved dwell time and exploration on Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants.

Conclusion: The study showcases advancements in VR navigation, environment-aware evaluation methods, and experimental frameworks for metaverse platforms.

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

### [454] [The Science Fiction Science Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03430)
*Iyad Rahwan,Azim Shariff,Jean-François Bonnefon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'science fiction science,' a method using experimental simulations to predict social and behavioral impacts of future technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict and guide the development of future technologies before their social and behavioral impacts become entrenched.

Method: Experimental simulations of future technologies combined with immersive and controlled variations to collect quantitative behavioral and attitudinal data.

Result: Highlights potential benefits of the approach, identifies validity threats, and proposes constraints and unconventional methods to improve reliability.

Conclusion: Acknowledges the challenges in adopting 'science fiction science,' but emphasizes the importance of normalizing these methods to enable predictive and impactful experimental research on future technologies.

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

*Ruei-Che Chang,Rosiana Natalie,Wenqian Xu,Jovan Zheng Feng Yap,Anhong Guo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video for blind or visually impaired users in real-world assistive tasks, highlighting strengths in static scenes but shortcomings in dynamic situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of live video AI systems in assisting blind or visually impaired individuals in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: An exploratory study conducted with eight blind or visually impaired participants using a state-of-the-art live video AI in various indoor and outdoor environments.

Result: The system aids in static visual scenes but struggles in dynamic scenarios, provides useful supplementary information despite inaccuracies, and causes confusion due to assumptions, hallucinations, and generic responses.

Conclusion: Recommendations include enhancing sensing capabilities, refining intervention timing, and improving safety in assistive video AI systems for better real-world usability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

*Shengnan Yang,Rongqian Ma*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: As AI becomes integral to knowledge work, this study explores how users construct epistemic relationships with AI, identifying five dynamic relationship types in academic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human epistemic roles evolve when interacting with AI systems, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like academia.

Method: 31 interviews were conducted with academics across various disciplines to study how users assess, trust, and collaborate with AI. A five-part codebook was developed, identifying relationship types.

Result: The study identified five relationship types—Instrumental Reliance, Contingent Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic Abstention—reflecting varying dynamics of trust, task engagement, and human epistemic roles.

Conclusion: The study calls for a nuanced framework replacing static metaphors for AI, emphasizing the co-construction of knowledge between humans and AI and its implications for HCI research.

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.

### [457] [Overcoming the Loss Conditioning Bottleneck in Optimization-Based PDE Solvers: A Novel Well-Conditioned Loss Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02692)
*Wenbo Cao,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stabilized Gradient Residual (SGR) loss as an alternative to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in optimization-based PDE solvers, achieving faster convergence and better optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based PDE solvers tend to converge slower than classical iterative solvers, largely due to inefficiencies caused by the MSE loss, which squares the condition number and impairs optimization.

Method: The authors propose the SGR loss, a tunable loss function that modulates the condition number between the original system and its normal equations, systematically benchmarked within both ODIL and PINNs frameworks.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that the SGR loss outperforms the MSE loss by orders of magnitude in convergence speed and optimization stability, in both ODIL and PINNs frameworks.

Conclusion: The SGR loss addresses inefficiencies in optimization-based PDE solvers and provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for bridging the performance gap with classical solvers, emphasizing the importance of loss conditioning.

Abstract: Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have
gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the
loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),
or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge
much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as
inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the
inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly
forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs
optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual
(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition
number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to
the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence
behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL
framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and
compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical
experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL
framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster
convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework
shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently
outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge
the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based
solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key
insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.

*Hsun-Yu Lee,Jie Lin,Fang-Jing Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a VLC-based indoor localization method using low-cost spectral sensors and achieves improved localization accuracy with GAN-based synthetic data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor localization is crucial for applications like wayfinding, emergency response, and asset tracking, yet existing RF-based solutions face issues like multipath fading and coverage variability.

Method: The authors use visible light communication (VLC) coupled with spectral measurements from a low-cost AS7341 sensor. They employ a two-stage framework involving MLP training and synthetic data augmentation using TabGAN.

Result: Data augmentation with TabGAN lowers mean localization error from 62.9cm to 49.3cm (20% improvement) with minimal additional data collection.

Conclusion: GAN-based spectral data augmentation enables more accurate indoor localization, addressing data-scarcity challenges and improving model generalization.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization underpins applications ranging from wayfinding
and emergency response to asset tracking and smart-building services.
Radio-frequency solutions (e.g. Wi-Fi, RFID, UWB) are widely adopted but remain
vulnerable to multipath fading, interference, and uncontrollable coverage
variation. We explore an orthogonal modality -- visible light communication
(VLC) -- and demonstrate that the spectral signatures captured by a low-cost
AS7341 sensor can serve as robust location fingerprints.
  We introduce a two-stage framework that (i) trains a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) on real spectral measurements and (ii) enlarges the training corpus with
synthetic samples produced by TabGAN. The augmented dataset reduces the mean
localization error from 62.9cm to 49.3cm -- a 20% improvement -- while
requiring only 5% additional data-collection effort. Experimental results
obtained on 42 reference points in a U-shaped laboratory confirm that GAN-based
augmentation mitigates data-scarcity issues and enhances generalization.

### [459] [Can Large Language Models Identify Materials from Radar Signals?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03120)
*Jiangyou Zhu,Hongyu Deng,He Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: LLMaterial utilizes large language models (LLMs) with radar signal processing to identify material compositions directly from raw radar signals in an open-set setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar-based material recognition systems struggle with closed-set constraints and require extensive task-specific data collection. This paper explores whether pre-trained LLMs can be used for open-set material recognition without the need for radar-specific exposure during training.

Method: The method incorporates a physics-informed signal processing pipeline to distill redundant radar data into compact intermediate features, coupled with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. This allows LLMs to interpret and reason over the extracted radar features.

Result: Preliminary findings show LLMaterial successfully distinguishes among various common materials, overcoming traditional limitations in radar-based material recognition systems.

Conclusion: LLMaterial demonstrates the feasibility of integrating radar technology and LLMs for open-set material recognition, offering strong potential for practical applications in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical
capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform
context-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing
modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar
technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of
various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained
to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data
collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical
applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful
reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material
composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due
to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs
have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we
introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using
LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a
physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar
raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the
material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.
Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step
reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material
recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that
LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an accurate, energy-efficient, and real-time detection method for sleep apnea subtypes that can operate effectively on wearable devices using ECG data.

Method: The study evaluates various classical machine learning and deep learning methods for classification using 1-second ECG windows. It introduces and quantifies SleepLiteCNN, comparing its performance and energy efficiency.

Result: SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy, a 92% macro-F1 score, and only requires 1.8 microjoules per inference with 8-bit quantization, validated further through FPGA synthesis for hardware efficiency.

Conclusion: This work positions SleepLiteCNN as an effective, energy-efficient solution for real-time sleep apnea subtype detection, making it highly suitable for deployment in wearable devices.

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further
demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its
suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained
environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective
solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces Veli, a Bayesian model using variational inference to correct low-cost air quality sensor readings without relying on reference stations. Additionally, it introduces AQ-SDR, a large-scale data repository to standardize air quality sensor benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban air pollution causes millions of premature deaths annually, necessitating scalable and accurate air quality monitoring to mitigate this health crisis. Low-cost sensors are scalable alternatives to expensive reference-grade stations but suffer from inaccuracies due to drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference.

Method: The paper proposes Veli, an unsupervised Bayesian model utilizing variational inference to construct disentangled representations of low-cost sensor readings, separating true pollutant levels from sensor noise. It eliminates the need for sensor co-location with reference stations. The authors introduce AQ-SDR, a large repository of sensor data, as a benchmarking tool.

Result: Veli shows strong generalization across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling drift and irregular sensor behavior. AQ-SDR provides a comprehensive database with more than 23,000 sensor and station readings across various regions.

Conclusion: Veli offers a reference-free, efficient solution to overcoming inaccuracies in low-cost air quality sensors, addressing scalability issues in air quality monitoring. The AQ-SDR benchmark further advances standardization in this domain, and both resources will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

*Chunyu Liu,Hao Zhang,Wei Wu,Fuhui Zhou,Qihui Wu,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectrumFM, a foundation model for spectrum cognition using advanced machine learning, achieving notable performance boosts in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectrum cognition methods often struggle with generalization and accuracy when applied across diverse spectrum environments and tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: SpectrumFM integrates a spectrum encoder that combines convolutional neural networks and multi-head self-attention. It uses self-supervised learning tasks like masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction for pre-training, and applies low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: SpectrumFM shows significant improvements in performance metrics: a 30% higher detection probability in spectrum sensing (SS) at -4 dB SNR, over 10% increase in AUC for anomaly detection (AD), and a 9.6% boost in wireless technology classification (WTC) accuracy.

Conclusion: SpectrumFM effectively addresses the limitations of prior methods, demonstrating its capability to enhance spectrum cognition tasks with superior generalization and accuracy.

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to extract range and Doppler information using commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) with a single transceiver setup, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in using Wi-Fi CSI phase for sensing due to significant hardware asynchronization errors and the interference caused by close proximity of transmit and receive antennas.

Method: The authors propose a signal processing approach incorporating three innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation.

Result: The method achieves centimeter-level precision in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets and has been validated using commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC in realistic environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision sensing using commercial Wi-Fi hardware without specialized modifications or full-duplex capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated a mean attacker detection rate of 92.8% and maintained average user SINR above 13 dB, emphasizing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances security and communication performance, offering a proactive and adaptive solution for mmWave system security.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing
and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat
assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper investigates enhancing PPG-based sleep staging using dual-stream cross-attention architectures, leveraging auxiliary PPG-derived modalities for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring sleep quality is vital for well-being, but despite the widespread use of PPG sensors in wearables, reliably staging sleep with PPG alone poses significant challenges.

Method: The study compares single-stream models with dual-stream cross-attention strategies, utilizing PPG and PPG-derived data (e.g., synthetic ECG) to extract complementary information.

Result: Experiments using the MESA dataset show a notable improvement in sleep staging performance when combining PPG with its auxiliary modalities under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture.

Conclusion: Combining PPG with auxiliary information through advanced architectures like dual-stream cross-attention yields promising results for improving sleep staging with wearable technologies.

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised method called concurrence for measuring statistical dependence between signals, effective across varied types without prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to capture complex, non-linear dependencies in biological systems without prior knowledge.

Method: The approach uses temporal alignment and misalignment comparisons of signal segments to detect statistical dependence.

Result: Concurrence exposes signal relationships across diverse domains like fMRI, physiology, and behavior, without parameter tuning or pre-existing information.

Conclusion: Concurrence broadens tools for scientific discovery but requires validation against extraneous dependencies for specific research questions.

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

TL;DR: This paper presents a physics-informed denoising framework to reduce sensor data noise while maintaining physical consistency, validated on benchmark problems and applied to real additive manufacturing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of noisy sensor data, which hinders its utility for control, diagnostics, and decision-making in engineering systems.

Method: The proposed approach integrates energy-based models and Fisher score regularization to denoise data and ensure physical consistency with physics-based models. It employs a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) as a surrogate model for real-world applications.

Result: The method was validated on benchmark problems and applied to laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing data, demonstrating superior denoising performance compared to baseline methods under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: This framework enables robust, real-time sensor data interpretation, making it valuable for predictive control and defect mitigation in additive manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of
Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture,
hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated

exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and
eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges,
open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.

Conclusion: SparksMatter establishes itself as a groundbreaking tool for materials innovation, providing chemically valid, creative hypotheses and advancing the scope of automated design in the scientific arena.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,

executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically
meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing reliable uncertainty quantification methods for machine learning interatomic potentials to enable accurate modeling and decision-making in atomistic simulations.

Method: Investigating ensemble learning and D-optimality within the atomic cluster expansion framework, and introducing clustering-enhanced local D-optimality for heterogeneous datasets.

Result: Higher model accuracy improves uncertainty correlation and novelty detection, while D-optimality provides more conservative estimates. Clustering-enhanced local D-optimality substantially enhances error prediction and novelty detection in heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The study elucidates the importance of model fidelity and data heterogeneity for uncertainty quantification and suggests clustering-enhanced local D-optimality as a practical strategy for robust MLIP development.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic
modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In
this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and
D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed
that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted
uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with
D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well
calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict
errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To
address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality,
which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies
D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the
detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings
clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance
and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling
strategies for MLIP development.

*Davin Choo,Winston Fu,Derek Khu,Tzeh Yuan Neoh,Tze-Yang Poon,Nicholas Teh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores proportionality up to one good (PROP1) as a fairness metric for the online fair division problem, presenting hardness results for greedy algorithms but highlighting alternatives under non-adaptive adversaries and learning-augmented approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved issues in the approximability of fairness notions, specifically proportionality up to one good (PROP1), in online fair division scenarios where goods are allocated immediately and irrevocably.

Method: Three greedy algorithms are evaluated against adaptive adversaries. Non-adaptive adversaries and learning-augmented algorithms leveraging side-information, such as predictions of maximum item value (MIV), are studied.

Result: Three greedy algorithms fail to approximate PROP1 against adaptive adversaries. Uniform random allocation achieves PROP1 approximation under non-adaptive adversaries. Learning-augmented algorithms can robustly approximate PROP1 using MIV predictions. Stronger fairness metrics (e.g., EF1, MMS) remain unattainable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Conclusion: While some fairness guarantees for PROP1 are achievable with randomization and predictive side-information, classic fairness notions remain inherently difficult to approximate in the online fair division problem.

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Motivation: Current UAV communication methods face challenges in spectrum competition modeling, incorporating expert knowledge, and predicting adversary behavior.

Method: Develop UAV-FPG, a game-theoretic model that uses an expert knowledge base for frequency selection and large language models for dynamic path planning.

Result: Experimental findings show enhanced path planning and anti-interference performance, outperforming fixed strategies.

Conclusion: UAV-FPG proves to be an effective platform for advancing UAV anti-jamming strategies and adaptive decision-making in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant advancements in
communication stability and security through techniques such as frequency
hopping, signal spreading, and adaptive interference suppression. However,
challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert
knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we
propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a
game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between
interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in
communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge
base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path
planning, simulating a "strong adversary". Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language
model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic
scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.
UAV-FPG provides a robust platform for advancing anti-jamming strategies and
intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransAM, a transformer-based agent modeling framework that encodes local trajectories to represent the policies of other agents, addressing real-world challenges in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing agent modeling approaches that rely on unrealistic access to other agents' episodic trajectories.

Method: The authors develop TransAM, which uses a transformer architecture to encode local trajectory data into an embedding space, enabling robust modeling of other agents' policies.

Result: TransAM was tested in various multi-agent environments, demonstrating improved policy representation, better agent modeling, and higher episodic returns.

Conclusion: The study proves TransAM's efficacy in effectively modeling agent behaviors using local trajectory data, offering enhanced performance in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

Motivation: To explore whether learned communication strategies or carefully designed engineered ones are more effective and scalable in cooperative multi-agent tasks.

Method: The authors proposed two communication strategies: 1) Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where neural networks concurrently generate messages and actions; and 2) Intention Communication, which leverages an engineered system comprising an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to predict future states and generate messages.

Result: Both approaches were tested in tasks with varying observability. The engineered strategy exhibited superior success rates and better scalability as task complexity increased.

Conclusion: Engineered communication strategies can outperform learned approaches in MARL settings, particularly in complex environments, suggesting the importance of designed mechanisms in communication.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in traditional electrostatic accelerometers used in satellite missions like GRACE, aiming to enhance Earth's gravity field monitoring linked to climate and geodynamic processes.

Method: The paper employs closed-loop simulations of low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (LL-SST) and evaluates various accelerometer configurations, including machine learning-assisted data transplantation techniques.

Result: Findings demonstrate that dual hybrid accelerometer configurations yield the most accurate results, and machine learning-based transplantation approaches achieve comparable outcomes with reduced hardware requirements.

Conclusion: Combining quantum sensor technologies with advanced data recovery methods like machine learning is promising for future satellite gravimetry missions, ensuring improved gravity field monitoring and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of Earth's gravity field is essential for
tracking mass redistribution processes linked to climate variability,
hydrological cycles, and geodynamic phenomena. While the GRACE and GRACE
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have set the benchmark for satellite gravimetry
using low-low satellite to satellite tracking (LL-SST), the precision of
gravity field recovery still strongly depends on the quality of accelerometer
(ACC) performance and the continuity of ACC data. Traditional electrostatic
accelerometers (EA) face limitations that can hinder mission outcomes,
prompting exploration of advanced sensor technologies and data recovery
techniques. This study presents a systematic evaluation of accelerometer data
transplantation using novel accelerometer configurations, including Cold Atom
Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and hybrid EA-CAI setups, and applying both
analytical and machine learning-based methods. Using comprehensive closed-loop
LL-SST simulations, we compare four scenarios ranging from the conventional
EA-only setup to ideal dual hybrid configurations, with a particular focus on
the performance of transplant-based approaches using different neural network
approaches. Our results show that the dual hybrid configuration provides the
most accurate gravity field retrieval. However, the transplant-based hybrid
setup, especially when supported by machine learning, emerges as a robust and
cost-effective alternative, achieving comparable performance with minimal extra
hardware. These findings highlight the promise of combining quantum sensor
technology and data-driven transplantation for future satellite gravimetry
missions, paving the way for improved global monitoring of Earth's dynamic

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of data scarcity and poor generalization across materials and sensor configurations in UGW-based machine learning for structural health monitoring.

Method: The method combines Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) with fine-tuning to enhance a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for damage localization in thin-walled structures. MPCA extracts shared latent features for domain adaptation, and fine-tuning adapts the CNN to new conditions with minimal data.

Result: The proposed approach successfully reduced localization error in 12 case studies with composite materials and various sensor setups, outperforming traditional TL techniques.

Conclusion: The MPCA-based TL framework is a robust and data-efficient method for ultrasonic guided wave-based structural health monitoring, enabling better domain adaptation and reducing dependency on large training datasets.

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their
integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted
to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale
deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited
generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework
based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage
localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to
have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source
and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling
effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about
dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained
CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed
MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different
composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess
domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a
substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.
Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and
statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

*Meng Zhou,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClinicalFMamba, a hybrid architecture combining CNNs and State Space Models for enhanced multimodal medical image fusion, achieving superior clinical performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome current limitations in combining local and global feature modeling in multimodal medical image fusion methods, particularly addressing CNNs' inability to model global contexts efficiently and Transformers' computational inefficiency.

Method: The proposed method, ClinicalFMamba, synergistically integrates CNNs and the Mamba SSM model. A tri-plane scanning strategy is utilized for efficient 3D volumetric data processing.

Result: ClinicalFMamba demonstrates superior fusion performance across various quantitative metrics, supports real-time processing, and achieves better accuracy in downstream brain tumor classification tasks compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: ClinicalFMamba sets a new benchmark for efficient and clinically applicable multimodal medical image fusion methods, suitable for real-time deployment in medical contexts.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

*Pengwei Sun,Wei Peng,Lun Yu Li,Yixin Wang,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to generate realistic counterfactual 3D brain MRIs using anatomical and causal guidance, addressing evaluation and generalizability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual generation has potential in understanding diseases and generating plausible medical imaging, but creating accurate 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical constraints is challenging.

Method: Six generative models were adapted into 3D counterfactual frameworks using an anatomy-guided causal graph with regional brain volumes as conditioning inputs.

Result: Anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modified targeted regions but struggled to preserve non-targeted structures, showing both progress and limitations.

Conclusion: The research sets a foundation for interpretable brain MRI modeling and underscores the need for better architectures to capture anatomical interdependencies.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating
hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in
understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data.
However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical
and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural
complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we
convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by
incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which
regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is
evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness
and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the
generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results
indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the
targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving
non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable
and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark
highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture
anatomical interdependencies.

*Farzad Beizaee,Sina Hajimiri,Ismail Ben Ayed,Gregory Lodygensky,Christian Desrosiers,Jose Dolz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents REFLECT, a framework using rectified flows for efficient and precise unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MR imaging, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve anomaly localization in brain imaging, which is challenging due to the brain's complex structure and lack of labeled abnormal examples.

Method: REFLECT uses rectified flows to create a direct, linear correction trajectory for MR images, enabling single-step inference of anomalies by comparing input and corrected outputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that REFLECT outperforms existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods in brain segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: REFLECT provides an efficient, accurate approach for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization in brain imaging, simplifying the process compared to diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain imaging is crucial for
identifying pathologies without the need for labeled data. However, accurately
localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of
brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce
REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a
direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal
distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our
method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize
anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected
counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require
iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map,
enabling single-step inference. Extensive experiments on popular UAD brain
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that REFLECT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMD-Mamba, a multi-modal framework that integrates fundus images, genetic data, and socio-demographic variables for better AMD prognosis. It uses innovative metric learning and Vision Mamba for superior feature representation and multi-scale image information fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes irreversible vision loss, emphasizing the need for improved methods of early diagnosis and prognosis.

Method: The AMD-Mamba framework integrates multi-modal data, employs metric learning using AMD severity scores, utilizes Vision Mamba for pattern detection, and leverages multi-scale fusion of image and clinical data.

Result: Experimental results on the AREDS dataset show that the proposed biomarker is highly significant for AMD progression, and its integration with existing variables enhances early detection of high-risk AMD patients.

Conclusion: AMD-Mamba has great potential to improve AMD management through precise prognosis and early-stage risk detection, leveraging novel techniques and multi-modal data.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible
vision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In
this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD
prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates
color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At
its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that
leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the
model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with
clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis
methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing
models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local
information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and
simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular
changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale
fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different
resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818
color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic
variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the
progression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing
variables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at
early stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal
framework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds provide a compact alternative to traditional representations in 3D medical imaging, enabling better analysis of anatomical shapes.

Method: The authors reviewed literature from 2021 to 2025, summarizing existing methods, datasets, evaluation approaches, and identifying trends and challenges.

Result: The survey highlighted advancements like hybrid representations, self-supervised models, and generative techniques, as well as limitations like data scarcity and the need for robust clinical solutions.

Conclusion: The paper suggests future directions to address challenges in point cloud-based learning and improve its applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D
medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to
traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical
shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and
systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds,
focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and
variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize
representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight
clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends
include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised
models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as
data scarcity, inter-patient variability, and the need for interpretable and
robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are
outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

*Bo Zhang,JianFei Huo,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Hui Gao,Xiangyang Gong,Wendong Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nexus-INR for flexible and high-quality medical image super-resolution across arbitrary resolutions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional CNN-based and INR-based methods for adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution.

Method: The Nexus-INR framework incorporates dual-branch encoder with auxiliary tasks, cross-modal attention for knowledge distillation, and segmentation modules for improved reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on the BraTS2020 dataset show superior performance in super-resolution and segmentation metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Nexus-INR effectively enhances medical image super-resolution and downstream outcomes, offering a robust approach for adaptive-resolution challenges.

Abstract: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for
medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However,
traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are
typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods
overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and
leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this
paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which
employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality,
adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR
contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary
classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and
modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal
attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with
high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an
integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both
reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on
the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation
demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various
metrics.

*Yifei Sun,Zhanghao Chen,Hao Zheng,Yuqing Lu,Lixin Duan,Fenglei Fan,Ahmed Elazab,Xiang Wan,Changmiao Wang,Ruiquan Ge*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) for efficiently suppressing bone structures in chest X-ray images, enhancing diagnostic clarity while improving processing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bone suppression in chest X-rays either fail to fully suppress bones while maintaining local texture or are too computationally expensive for practical clinical use.

Method: The proposed GL-LCM integrates lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion for fast high-resolution bone suppression. It uses a novel Local-Enhanced Guidance technique to address boundary artifacts and detail blurring without additional training.

Result: Experiments on two datasets, SZCH-X-Rays and JSRT, demonstrate that GL-LCM significantly improves bone suppression and computational efficiency compared to competitive approaches.

Conclusion: The GL-LCM model provides superior bone suppression in chest X-ray imaging while being computationally efficient, making it well-suited for clinical applications.

Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant
challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details
necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning,
particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively
minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving
clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods
for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete
suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their
high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical
use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a
Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model
combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion,
enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle
potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we
further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without
additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset
SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers
superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency,
significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study evaluates whether preoperative MRI improves erectile dysfunction predictions post-radical prostatectomy, exploring clinical-only, handcrafted MRI features, deep learning, and fusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Erectile dysfunction prediction post-prostatectomy is crucial for patient counseling, but the role of preoperative MRI is not fully understood.

Method: Four predictive modeling strategies were assessed using clinical features and preoperative MRI: clinical-only models, handcrafted anatomical MRI features, deep learning directly on MRI, and multimodal fusion approaches.

Result: MRI-based models slightly outperformed handcrafted approaches, but failed to surpass clinical-only models with AUC scores. Fusion models provided negligible improvement.

Conclusion: MRI-based predictions focus on anatomical structures but do not outperform clinical-only methods, hinting at their potential complementary role in future multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important
for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical
features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI
remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional
predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling
strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current
state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features
derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and
(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models
(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches
(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models
offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only
performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to
predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model
suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the
prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve
predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they
try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement
clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CADD, a conditional diffusion model for anomaly detection in medical brain images, outperforming current methods in detecting neurological abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges in detecting pathologies in heterogeneous medical data by combining normative modeling with diffusion models, thus addressing the shortcomings of current methods.

Method: The authors propose a conditional diffusion model named CADD, with a novel inference inpainting strategy that balances anomaly removal and retention of subject-specific features, tailored for 3D images and medical contexts.

Result: CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities, validated across three datasets including clinical scans with challenging conditions like low contrast and motion artifacts.

Conclusion: CADD offers a significant advancement in medical anomaly detection by combining the strengths of normative models and diffusion models, showing robust performance in clinical applications.

Abstract: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital
archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images.
However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult
challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers
a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is
modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to
disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly
detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and
generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;
differences between the original and restored images highlight potential
abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model
approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important
context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard
approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor
reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the
first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide
the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting
strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific
features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,
which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities
in heterogeneous cohorts.

TL;DR: This paper introduces READ, a real-time diffusion-transformer framework for talking head generation that achieves superior quality and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have improved audio-driven talking head generation, but their slow inference speed hinders practical usage.

Method: The method involves a temporal VAE for video compression, a Speech Autoencoder for audio compression, and an Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer for latent modeling, along with an asynchronous noise scheduler for temporal consistency.

Result: READ outperforms existing methods by producing high-quality talking head videos with significantly faster runtime and stable performance over extended durations.

Conclusion: READ achieves a balance between efficiency, video quality, and consistency, making it suitable for real-time talking head generation.

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: This paper introduces three visualization tools to assist students in understanding multitape Turing machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observed difficulty that students face in grasping the operational semantics and behaviors of multitape Turing machines.

Method: The researchers developed three visualization tools: dynamic simulation of machine execution, static rendering of transition diagrams, and static rendering of computation graphs for multitape Turing machines.

Result: The tools were used to aid students' comprehension and empirical evidence demonstrated that students found the tools helpful and effective.

Conclusion: Visualization tools improve understanding and teaching effectiveness for complex concepts like multitape Turing machines in formal languages and automata theory.

Abstract: Many Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses introduce students to
Turing machine extensions. One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing
machines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an
abstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less
challenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM
programming language provides support for their definition and execution. This,
however, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the
operational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines
accept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools
have been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates
machine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically
renders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The
third is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation
graphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and
illustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape
Turing machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these
tools are well-received and found useful by students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning outcomes for Formal Languages and Automata Theory students by providing structured support in developing regular expressions.

Method: The framework consists of a design recipe for creating regular expressions, a system for recipe-based error messaging, and a shorthand syntax for writing unit tests. It is also applied in-class and through debugging examples.

Result: The framework effectively supports the design of regular expressions, simplifies debugging, and offers an educational tool tailored for students.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the educational process for regular expressions, providing better tools for error identification and debugging while following good design practices.

Abstract: This article presents a novel framework to provide Formal Languages and
Automata Theory students design support for the development of regular
expressions. This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions
and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces
recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully
completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of
being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a
shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class
use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the
described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging
system is briefly sketched.

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper presents visualization tools aimed at helping students better understand nondeterministic finite-state and pushdown automata by illustrating their stepwise operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students struggle with understanding nondeterministic finite-state and pushdown automata due to differences from deterministic programming and challenges such as reasoning with stack values.

Method: The authors developed dynamic visualization tools integrated in a domain-specific programming language tailored to Automata Theory courses.

Result: The visualization tools effectively represent stepwise computations and enable users to validate state properties during transitions.

Conclusion: The introduced visualization tools enhance comprehension and verification processes for nondeterministic machines, aiding educational efforts in Automata Theory.

Abstract: In Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses, students find understanding
nondeterministic finite-state and pushdown automata difficult. In many cases,
this means that it is challenging for them to comprehend the operational
semantics of such machines and, as a consequence, determine why a word is
accepted or rejected. This is not entirely surprising, because students are
mostly trained to design and implement deterministic programs. Comprehension of
pushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is
necessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding
that two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with
different stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel
dynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language
for the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines.
These tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by
a nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise
manner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by
allowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents
hold when a machine transitions into it.

*Zhaoyi Meng,Fenglei Xu,Wenxiang Zhao,Wansen Wang,Wenchao Huang,Jie Cui,Hong Zhong,Yan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MalFlows is a novel tool designed for Android malware detection, leveraging a heterogeneous information network (HIN) and context-aware embedding techniques to integrate various flow semantics for precise app profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Android app analysis fail to effectively integrate control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications (ICCs) due to lack of semantic complementarity and contextual awareness.

Method: MalFlows utilizes a heterogeneous information network (HIN) and introduces flow2vec, a context-aware embedding technique. These methods enable the fusion of diverse flows and their semantics. The resulting app representations are processed by a channel-attention-based deep neural network for classification.

Result: MalFlows demonstrated superior performance in malware detection over baselines by analyzing over 20 million flow instances from 31,000 real-world apps.

Conclusion: The study highlights the advantage of integrating diverse program flows for malware detection and presents MalFlows as an effective solution that outperforms existing techniques.

Abstract: Static analysis, a fundamental technique in Android app examination, enables
the extraction of control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications
(ICCs), all of which are essential for malware detection. However, existing
methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different
types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware
nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We
propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware
fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal
is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related
information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information
network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We
further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that
distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual
constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations
through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally
fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware
classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for
assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale
dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than
31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows
outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and
meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app
representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.

### [494] [Agentic Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02836)
*Mengyu Zhang,Zhuotao Liu,Jingwen Huang,Xuanqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agentic-PPML, a framework aimed at improving the efficiency of privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of current PPML methods for large language models (LLMs), which are significantly slower compared to plaintext inference.

Method: The approach modularly separates intent understanding using general-purpose LLMs from cryptography-intensive computations handled by domain-specific models.

Result: Agentic-PPML eliminates the need for LLMs to process encrypted input, improving practical deployment feasibility for LLM-related services.

Conclusion: Agentic-PPML offers a step forward in making PPML practical for LLMs by tackling inefficiencies through modular processing.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is critical to ensure data privacy
in AI. Over the past few years, the community has proposed a wide range of
provably secure PPML schemes that rely on various cryptography primitives.
However, when it comes to large language models (LLMs) with billions of
parameters, the efficiency of PPML is everything but acceptable. For instance,
the state-of-the-art solution for confidential LLM inference represents at
least 10,000-fold slower performance compared to plaintext inference. The
performance gap is even larger when the context length increases. In this
position paper, we propose a novel framework named Agentic-PPML to make PPML in
LLMs practical. Our key insight is to employ a general-purpose LLM for intent
understanding and delegate cryptographically secure inference to specialized
models trained on vertical domains. By modularly separating language intent
parsing - which typically involves little or no sensitive information - from
privacy-critical computation, Agentic-PPML completely eliminates the need for
the LLMs to process the encrypted prompts, enabling practical deployment of
privacy-preserving LLM-centric services.

*Jiewei Lai,Lan Zhang,Chen Tang,Pengcheng Sun,Xinming Wang,Yunhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel multiplicative attack method that makes DeepFakes untraceable by eliminating generative model traces, achieving highly effective evasion rates against attribution models (AMs), even when defensive measures are applied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities in existing DeepFakes attribution models (AMs) which can be circumvented by certain attacks, exposing the need for more robust attribution mechanisms.

Method: A universal and black-box multiplicative attack method is proposed, which trains an adversarial model using only real data. This approach is applicable across different generative models (GMs) and is agnostic to attribution models.

Result: Experimental tests show a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08% against six advanced AMs across DeepFakes generated by nine GMs, and surpasses 72.39% ASR even with defensive mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in current AMs when facing multiplicative attacks, highlighting the urgent need for developing more robust attribution technologies to counter evolving threats.

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly
enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by
generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their
source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution
models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs.
However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated
by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes
can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally
eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive
measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an
adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and
agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack
capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average
attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes
generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method
maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential
challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more
robust AMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VFLAIR-LLM, a lightweight split learning framework tailored for privacy-preserving LLM adaptation in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in secure LLM adaptation for users with data privacy concerns and limited computational resources.

Method: The study develops VFLAIR-LLM, a split learning framework enabling collaborative learning with modular support for privacy-focused tasks, attacks, and defenses.

Result: VFLAIR-LLM supports multiple partition settings, task types, and datasets, while benchmarking various attacks and defenses to provide real-world actionable insights.

Conclusion: VFLAIR-LLM proves to be an efficient solution for secure and resource-effective LLM fine-tuning and inference in privacy-sensitive domains.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have
expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy
concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private
deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial
challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources.
To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning
(SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting
LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at
https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split
learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and
fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM
partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition,
we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and
defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning
for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the
choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant
hyperparameters for real-world applications.

*Bingyu Yan,Ziyi Zhou,Xiaoming Zhang,Chaozhuo Li,Ruilin Zeng,Yirui Qi,Tianbo Wang,Litian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAST, a stealthy and adaptive attack framework for multi-agent systems relying on language model-based communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems using large language models, particularly focusing on communication-based vulnerabilities.

Method: The proposed framework, MAST, uses a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search and Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack model and employs semantic and embedding similarity constraints to enhance stealth during tampering.

Result: MAST demonstrates high attack success rates and improved stealthiness across varied tasks, communication frameworks, and language models in experiments.

Conclusion: The study underscores both the effectiveness and stealth of MAST while emphasizing the critical need for robust safeguards for communication in language model-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively
accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but
this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack
methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct
and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and
stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy
Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within
the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference
Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates
effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve
stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints
during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks,
communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently
achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness
compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness,
stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust
communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

*Yu Pan,Jiahao Chen,Lin Wang,Bingrong Dai,Yi Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'BadBlocks,' a lightweight and covert backdoor attack method targeting diffusion models in image generation. This method is highly effective and bypasses state-of-the-art defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models excel in image generation, they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing defense mechanisms struggle against novel, lightweight, and covert threats.

Method: BadBlocks selectively contaminates specific blocks in the UNet architecture of diffusion models, requiring fewer computational resources and bypassing advanced defense techniques.

Result: BadBlocks achieves high attack success rates with minimal perceptual quality loss and evades most defense methods under constrained resources.

Conclusion: BadBlocks lowers the barrier to backdoor attacks on diffusion models, posing a significant threat even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the
field of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusion
models are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulate
the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or
textual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuous
advancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable of
identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and
neural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify a
novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing
approaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of the
computational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor
attacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced
defense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate
specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while
maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimental
results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR)
and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremely
constrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able to
bypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoor
detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablation
studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require
fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural
network layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces the
barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers to
inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade
GPUs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering to convert legacy cybersecurity incident response playbooks into a standardized, machine-readable CACAO format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are written in inconsistent and non-machine-readable formats, limiting their automation and interoperability in security systems.

Method: The authors used Prompt Engineering techniques with LLMs to create a modular pipeline that includes syntax checking and iterative refinement for translating legacy playbooks into the CACAO format.

Result: The approach shows significant improvements in syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity, effectively capturing complex workflows and reducing transformation errors.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates considerable potential for practical deployment in automating cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous,
non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and
interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,
combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident
response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We
systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully
design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for
control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a
syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate
the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy
playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook
transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow
structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for
practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.
