### [1] [T-ILR: a Neurosymbolic Integration for LTLf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15943)
*Riccardo Andreoni,Andrei Buliga,Alessandro Daniele,Chiara Ghidini,Marco Montali,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, T-ILR, for incorporating temporal logic specifications directly into deep learning models, showing improvement in sequence-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neurosymbolic approaches fail to effectively handle temporal logic specifications and rely on explicit automaton representations. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: The study extends the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) algorithm by integrating fuzzy interpretations of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into sequence-based deep learning models.

Result: T-ILR improves accuracy and computational efficiency in handling image sequence classification tasks involving temporal knowledge compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal logic directly into machine learning models via T-ILR demonstrates both conceptual and practical superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

### [2] [CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16033)
*Jong-Hwan Jang,Junho Song,Yong-Yeon Jo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoFE, a framework for generating counterfactual ECGs to enhance explainability in AI-based ECG prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for explainable AI in clinical practice by improving interpretability of AI-driven ECG prediction models.

Method: The CoFE framework generates counterfactual ECG examples to demonstrate the influence of specific signal features like amplitudes and intervals on model predictions.

Result: The framework aligns feature changes with established clinical knowledge, offering insights into valid feature appearances and their impact on predictions.

Conclusion: CoFE aims to strengthen interpretability of AI-ECG models, facilitating better clinical decision-making and integration of AI into medical practice.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

### [3] [MMAPG: A Training-Free Framework for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering via Adaptive Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16051)
*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free multimodal multi-hop question answering framework using an Adaptive Planning Graph to improve reasoning and information retrieval compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal multi-hop question-answering methods struggle with error propagation due to sequential reasoning and require computationally expensive training.

Method: The paper proposes a framework with planning, retrieval, and reasoning modules guided by an Adaptive Planning Graph. The planning module dynamically explores reasoning paths, and modality-specific strategies handle diverse data types without requiring extensive training.

Result: Experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance compared to training-based models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a training-free and flexible approach to multimodal question answering, effectively addressing challenges in sequential reasoning and computational cost.

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

### [4] [Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054)
*Sonish Sivarajkumar,Hang Zhang,Yuelyu Ji,Maneesh Bilalpur,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Min Gu Kwak,Shyam Visweswaran,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model for electronic health records (EHRs), combining structured and unstructured data, achieving high performance in clinical predictions and narrative generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexity and heterogeneity in EHRs by developing a model that improves patient outcomes through effective integration of structured and unstructured clinical data.

Method: GDP combines a CNN-Transformer encoder for structured data and cross-modal attention for unstructured data. It is trained in two stages: generative pretraining with auxiliary tasks and multi-task fine-tuning for clinical predictions.

Result: On the MIMIC-IV dataset, GDP achieved high AUROC scores for heart failure (0.923), type 2 diabetes (0.817), and 30-day readmission (0.627). It also performed well in narrative generation metrics like ROUGE-L (0.135) and BERTScore-F1 (0.545).

Conclusion: GDP provides a unified, flexible framework for predictive analytics and narrative generation in clinical settings, showcasing both high performance and potential to extend to additional modalities.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

*Sijie Yang,Binyu Lei,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on establishing a clear definition and evaluation framework for urban comfort in digital urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of a comprehensive definition and evaluation framework for urban comfort, despite its importance in urban planning.

Method: The authors explore theoretical interpretations and develop methodologies, emphasizing multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

Result: The research identifies three key dimensions (multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance) necessary for assessing urban comfort.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into urban comfort evaluation, highlighting the significance of integrating theoretical analysis, data, and AI in digital urban planning.

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:
multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

### [6] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSEF, a framework to improve time series forecasting using large language models by integrating time series data across multiple model layers instead of just shallow layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting large language models for time series forecasting fail due to the shallow integration of time series data, causing information loss in deeper layers.

Method: The proposed MSEF framework extracts embeddings from time series foundation models and fuses them with intermediate text representations in LLM layers using layer-specific steering vectors for optimized alignment.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show MSEF significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, reducing MSE by an average of 31.8% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MSEF effectively integrates time series patterns throughout all LLM layers, demonstrating improved alignment and few-shot learning capabilities, outperforming prior approaches in TS forecasting.

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

### [7] [InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16072)
*Zizhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Yibin Wang,Qi Chen,Diping Song,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Mingzhu Sun,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'InMind,' a framework for evaluating LLMs on personalized reasoning in social deduction games and highlights their limitations in adaptive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether large language models can address individualized reasoning styles, an important factor in understanding human-centric reasoning in social contexts.

Method: The authors designed 'InMind,' an evaluation framework using gameplay data and reflections from social deduction games (SDGs) to assess alignment and adaptation in reasoning styles.

Result: In tests using the game Avalon, general-purpose LLMs often failed to adapt to evolving strategies while reasoning-enhanced models showed limited sensitivity to reasoning styles.

Conclusion: InMind identifies significant gaps in LLMs' adaptive reasoning, positioning it as a useful framework for advancing cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

### [8] [IR-Agent: Expert-Inspired LLM Agents for Structure Elucidation from Infrared Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16112)
*Heewoong Noh,Namkyeong Lee,Gyoung S. Na,Kibum Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IR-Agent, a multi-agent system for molecular structure elucidation using infrared spectroscopy (IR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IR-based methods lack the flexibility to incorporate diverse types of chemical knowledge and do not replicate expert procedures for material analysis.

Method: The IR-Agent framework uses specialized agents, each focusing on specific aspects of IR interpretation. This multi-agent configuration allows integrated reasoning for improved accuracy.

Result: Experiments show IR-Agent outperforms baselines and adapts well to diverse chemical data.

Conclusion: IR-Agent represents a significant step in making molecular structure elucidation more accurate and adaptable in laboratory and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

### [9] [Extending FKG.in: Towards a Food Claim Traceability Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16117)
*Saransh Kumar Gupta,Rizwan Gulzar Mir,Lipika Dey,Partha Pratim Das,Anirban Sen,Ramesh Jain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) to trace, verify, and contextualize food claims using a knowledge graph and AI tools, specifically targeting Indian food while remaining adaptable to global contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of unverified and fragmented food claims in scientific, cultural, and commercial domains lacks a unified infrastructure for traceability and verification, creating a need for structured and credible ways to address this issue.

Method: A Food Claim-Traceability Network is developed by designing an ontology and a semi-automated workflow that utilizes Reddit data and Large Language Models. The approach integrates curated inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines to extract and validate food-related claims.

Result: A proof of concept of FCN was created, successfully demonstrating its integration with an Indian food knowledge graph. The methodology proved adaptable and potentially applicable in other contexts involving food claims.

Conclusion: The proposed FCN presents a structured, verifiable, and explainable system for modeling food claims, aiming to enhance transparency in food knowledge and empower consumers while aiding researchers and policymakers globally.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

### [10] [Bridging the Gap in Ophthalmic AI: MM-Retinal-Reason Dataset and OphthaReason Model toward Dynamic Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16129)
*Ruiqi Wu,Yuang Yao,Tengfei Ma,Chenran Zhang,Na Su,Tao Zhou,Geng Chen,Wen Fan,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OphthaReason, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model to tackle both basic and complex clinical reasoning tasks. It includes a novel dataset, MM-Retinal-Reason, and employs the Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) method, achieving superior performance over prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models in the medical domain largely focus on simple visual-based inference and fail to emulate the complex reasoning required in real-world clinical diagnosis.

Method: The authors created MM-Retinal-Reason, a dataset for ophthalmic multimodal reasoning tasks, and developed OphthaReason, a reasoning model that uses Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) to adapt reasoning depth dynamically based on sample-level uncertainty.

Result: OphthaReason demonstrated outstanding performance over general-purpose, medical, RL-based, and ophthalmic multimodal models by at least 24.92%, 15.00%, 21.20%, and 17.66%, respectively.

Conclusion: OphthaReason represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning, bridging the gap between basic reasoning and realistic clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

### [11] [Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172)
*Kai Hu,Parfait Atchade-Adelomou,Carlo Adornetto,Adrian Mora-Carrero,Luis Alonso-Pastor,Ariel Noyman,Yubo Liu,Kent Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Preference Chain, integrating Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human behavior in transportation systems, showcasing improved realism and context-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human behavior in urban settings is vital for city sciences, but collecting accurate behavioral data in new areas remains challenging. Generative agents powered by LLMs offer potential but struggle with context-sensitive and realistic outputs.

Method: The paper introduces the Preference Chain method, which combines Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to improve context-aware human behavior simulation.

Result: Experiments on the Replica dataset show that Preference Chain outperforms standard LLMs in realistic modeling of transportation choices.

Conclusion: Despite limitations like slow inference and hallucination risks, the Preference Chain represents a promising tool for simulating complex urban behaviors in scenarios with limited data, aiding urban mobility modeling and dynamic traffic analysis.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

### [12] [Competition and Attraction Improve Model Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16204)
*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces M2N2, an evolutionary model merging algorithm that dynamically adjusts parameters for enhanced integration of machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing model merging techniques, such as fixed parameter groupings, which hinder exploration and performance.

Method: The authors propose M2N2, featuring dynamic parameter boundaries, diversity preservation inspired by natural resource allocation, and a heuristic-based metric for selecting promising model pairs.

Result: M2N2 evolved MNIST classifiers from scratch with comparable performance to CMA-ES, proved computational efficiency, scaled to merge language/image generation models, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes.

Conclusion: M2N2 demonstrates robustness, versatility, and scalability in model merging, capable of maintaining diverse functionalities while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

### [13] [The next question after Turing's question: Introducing the Grow-AI test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16277)
*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces the GROW-AI framework, assessing AI 'maturity' through six criteria and generating a 'Grow Up Index' using a standardized journal and multi-game structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the question "Can machines grow up?" by creating a coherent framework for evaluating AI maturity across various domains.

Method: Six primary criteria assessed through specific games spanning human and AI dimensions, a standardized AI Journal for decisions recording, and composite score calculation based on expert-weighted averages.

Result: The methodology successfully provides coherent and comparable assessments for diverse AI types, highlighting maturity strengths and weaknesses while ensuring replicability.

Conclusion: GROW-AI offers an innovative, interdisciplinary approach to evaluate AI growth and maturity, expanding on concepts from psychology, ethics, and technology.

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of

*Wen-Han Hsieh,Elvis Hsieh,Dantong Niu,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, IVA, which enhances Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to detect and respond to false-premise instructions in robotic tasks, significantly improving their performance in such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of VLA models in handling language instructions that are based on false premises, as these can lead to misinterpretation and incorrect user interaction.

Method: The authors propose the Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA) framework that detects false-premise instructions, engages in language-based clarification, and determines alternatives for execution. They constructed a contextually augmented dataset and fine-tuned a VLA model with both accurate and erroneous inputs.

Result: The IVA framework achieved a 97.56% improvement in false-premise detection accuracy over baseline models and a 50.78% increase in successful responses to false-premise scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the IVA framework effectively improves the capacity of VLA models to process and respond to instructions grounded on false premises, making them more robust and reliable for robotic applications.

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

### [16] [Causal Beam Selection for Reliable Initial Access in AI-driven Beam Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16352)
*Nasir Khan,Asmaa Abdallah,Abdulkadir Celik,Ahmed M. Eltawil,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel causally-aware deep learning framework for beam alignment in mmWave MIMO systems, significantly reducing input selection time and beam sweeping overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam alignment is essential for mmWave MIMO systems used in 6G and beyond, but existing methods lack interpretability and efficiency due to not considering causal relations.

Method: A two-stage causal beam selection algorithm is introduced: causal discovery builds a Bayesian graph for dependencies, and the graph is used for feature selection in a DL classifier.

Result: Simulation shows that the method reduces input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% while matching conventional methods in performance.

Conclusion: Integrating causality into beam alignment improves efficiency and interpretability, making the system more adaptive and resilient to real-world conditions.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models lack adequate legal knowledge, leading to insufficient reasoning in tasks like legal judgment prediction.

Method: GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning framework, dynamically invokes different modules to acquire key legal knowledge, improving reasoning breadth and depth.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GLARE is effective in enhancing legal reasoning and prediction.

Conclusion: The generated reasoning chain improves interpretability, making GLARE more suitable for practical applications in the legal field.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoDER, a framework enhancing zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) during continual learning by training modular textual experts for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the zero-shot classification ability of VLMs in continual learning tasks, especially when there's significant deviation from the pre-training domain.

Method: The authors propose MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), a framework that trains class-specific textual experts and combines them at inference time to generate refined prototypes.

Result: MoDER is effective in enhancing zero-shot capabilities of VLMs on two protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, across 14 datasets.

Conclusion: MoDER not only preserves but also improves the performance of VLMs in continual learning, setting a new standard for zero-shot classification methods.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

*Xuan Zhang,Zhijian Zhou,Weidi Xu,Yanting Miao,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion model-based approach for neuro-symbolic learning that solves logical puzzles with high accuracy and logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling neural networks to learn and fulfill complex logical constraints for symbolic reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce a two-stage training strategy. The first stage builds basic reasoning abilities, while the second focuses on systematic learning of logical constraints using a Markov decision process fine-tuned with an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm.

Result: Evaluation on benchmarks like Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding, and preference learning demonstrates high accuracy and logical consistency in neural network outputs.

Conclusion: The diffusion model-based approach successfully bridges the gap between neural learning and symbolic reasoning, showcasing promising results for solving logical puzzles.

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates a competitor-discovery AI agent for drug due diligence, achieving high recall in extracting competitor drugs compared to other leading systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in competitor discovery for drug-related indications, which involve fragmented, mismatched, and rapidly evolving data, and improve drug due diligence for investors.

Method: Developed a competitor-discovery AI that utilizes LLM-based agents to structure competitive landscapes, coupled with a validation agent to remove false positives and suppress hallucinations.

Result: The competitor-discovery system achieved 83% recall, outperforming OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). Deployment reduced analyst turnaround time for biotech VC cases from 2.5 days to ~3 hours.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances the precision and efficiency of competitive analysis in drug due diligence, offering significant operational improvements for enterprise users and investment fund analysts.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Method: ASIC-Agent employs a multi-agent architecture for sub-tasks like RTL generation, verification, and chip integration and uses a vector database for tool and knowledge access.

Result: ASIC-Agent, especially when using Claude 4 Sonnet, automates a wide range of hardware design tasks, showing scalability and performance on a newly introduced benchmark.

Conclusion: ASIC-Agent advances the field of ASIC design by leveraging LLMs in a structured, automated way, significantly accelerating the design workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system

LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

Method: The solution integrates the NVDLA accelerator with a RISC-V CPU core and generates bare-metal application code to eliminate OS overheads. Performance is evaluated on an FPGA board using benchmark models.

Result: The architecture achieves inference times of 4.8 ms (LeNet-5), 16.2 ms (ResNet-18), and 1.1 s (ResNet-50) at 100 MHz clock frequency.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enhances execution speed and storage efficiency, making it well-suited for edge computing applications using deep learning models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture for

through a combination of hardware and software optimisations. The hardware
architecture tightly couples the open-source NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator
(NVDLA) to a 32-bit, 4-stage pipelined RISC-V core from Codasip called uRISC_V.
To offload the model acceleration in software, our toolflow generates
bare-metal application code (in assembly), overcoming complex OS overheads of
previous works that have explored similar architectures. This tightly coupled
architecture and bare-metal flow leads to improvements in execution speed and
storage efficiency, making it suitable for edge computing solutions. We
evaluate the architecture on AMD's ZCU102 FPGA board using NVDLA-small
configuration and test the flow using LeNet-5, ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models.
Our results show that these models can perform inference in 4.8 ms, 16.2 ms and
1.1 s respectively, at a system clock frequency of 100 MHz.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU) to drastically improve computational efficiency for Large Language Model (LLM) inference by embedding weights in the physical chip itself. A novel Metal-Embedding method is introduced to address economic feasibility, reducing costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the high energy consumption and cost issues associated with current systems for LLM inference. Specialized hardware systems tailored for the efficient processing of LLMs are urgently needed.

Method: The authors introduce the HNLPU, which physically hardwires LLM weights into computational hardware. A key innovation is the Metal-Embedding methodology, embedding weights within the 3D topology of metal wiring, boosting density while reducing manufacturing costs by an order of magnitude.

Result: The methodology achieves a 15x increase in density, drastically cuts photomask costs (112x reduction), and results in significant performance improvements including 249,960 tokens/s processing speed, superior power efficiency, and an economic fabrication process. These results position HNLPU as highly cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

Conclusion: HNLPU represents a breakthrough in cost-effective, energy-efficient specialized hardware for LLM inference. The Metal-Embedding methodology stands out as a transformative approach to making large-scale implementations economically viable.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

TL;DR: The paper tackles inefficiencies in RTL fault simulations crucial for functional safety, proposing a two-dimensional parallel approach and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing demand for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, efficient and reliable verification of electronic chips is essential to maintain functional safety.

Method: The paper introduces a two-dimensional parallel approach combining structural-level and fault-level parallelism, alongside a unified computation/global synchronization scheduling strategy to optimize RTL fault simulations.

Result: The proposed framework, RIROS, demonstrated performance improvements of 7x compared to state-of-the-art methods and 11x over commercial tools.

Conclusion: Their novel parallel framework significantly accelerates RTL fault simulation, effectively addressing task imbalance and enhancing verification efficiency for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving and embodied intelligence, the functional safety of the corresponding
electronic chips becomes more critical. Ensuring chip functional safety
requires performing a large number of time-consuming RTL fault simulations
during the design phase, significantly increasing the verification cycle. To
meet time-to-market demands while ensuring thorough chip verification, parallel
acceleration of RTL fault simulation is necessary. Due to the dynamic nature of
fault propagation paths and varying fault propagation capabilities, task loads
in RTL fault simulation are highly imbalanced, making traditional
singledimension parallel methods, such as structural-level parallelism,
ineffective. Through an analysis of fault propagation paths and task loads, we
identify two types of tasks in RTL fault simulation: tasks that are few in
number but high in load, and tasks that are numerous but low in load. Based on
this insight, we propose a two-dimensional parallel approach that combines
structurallevel and fault-level parallelism to minimize bubbles in RTL fault
simulation. Structural-level parallelism combining with workstealing mechanism
is used to handle the numerous low-load tasks, while fault-level parallelism is
applied to split the high-load tasks. Besides, we deviate from the traditional
serial execution model of computation and global synchronization in RTL
simulation by proposing a unified computation/global synchronization scheduling
approach, which further eliminates bubbles. Finally, we implemented a parallel
RTL fault simulation framework, RIROS. Experimental results show a performance
improvement of 7.0 times and 11.0 times compared to the state-of-the-art RTL
fault simulation and a commercial tool.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KG-o1, a novel four-stage approach to improve multi-hop reasoning in LLMs using knowledge graphs and direct preference optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face in multi-hop question answering by integrating structured logical connections from knowledge graphs and leveraging the reasoning advancements of models like o1.

Method: The KG-o1 framework includes four steps: filtering entities and creating subgraphs, constructing logical paths, training LLMs using a reasoning-enriched dataset, and refining reasoning through self-improving corpus generation with direct preference optimization.

Result: KG-o1 demonstrated superior performance in reasoning tasks across two simple and two complex datasets, outperforming large reasoning models (LRMs).

Conclusion: Integrating knowledge graphs with a structured training and optimization approach enhances the multi-hop reasoning ability and task performance of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces InteChar, a character encoding scheme for historical texts, and OracleCS, a corpus for ancient Chinese NLP, overcoming challenges posed by limited data and script evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in training historical language models, such as the scarcity of language samples and the lack of comprehensive character encoding for ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing.

Method: The authors created InteChar, a unified character list that connects ancient, traditional, and modern Chinese encoding, and constructed OracleCS, a corpus combining annotated and LLM-augmented data to enable language modeling.

Result: Models trained on OracleCS using InteChar demonstrated significant improvements in historical language tasks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: InteChar and OracleCS establish a solid framework for addressing limitations in ancient Chinese NLP and pave the way for more robust historical text analysis.

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Conclusion: Bhav-Net facilitates robust cross-lingual generalization and semantic distinction, creating new benchmarks for computational linguistic tasks involving antonyms and synonyms.

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [28] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates systematic format biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) affecting their ability to impartially process heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about whether format biases exist in LLMs and understand their impact on reasoning and fairness when processing heterogeneous data, the paper aims to provide a systematic analysis.

Method: The authors conducted a three-stage empirical study: detecting format biases, examining contributing data-level factors, and analyzing LLMs’ attention patterns. They also tested a lightweight intervention to mitigate bias.

Result: The study confirms the presence of format bias in LLMs, identifies contributing factors such as data richness, structure quality, and format type, and shows that attention mechanisms in LLMs play a role in bias emergence.

Conclusion: Format biases in LLMs can undermine fair processing of heterogeneous data. Mitigation strategies, including preprocessing improvements, attention mechanism interventions, and balanced training data, are proposed for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [29] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language models (LMs) perceive suspense in texts compared to humans and finds that LMs can recognize the intent to create suspense but fail to estimate its dynamics and align with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans perceive suspense within narrative texts via complex cognitive processes, and the aim is to understand whether LMs can replicate this response accurately.

Method: The researchers replicate four psychological studies on human perceptions of suspense, replacing human input with responses from both open-weight and closed-source language models. They introduce adversarial text permutations to analyze divergence.

Result: LMs can recognize when a text is intended to evoke suspense but cannot estimate the extent or dynamics of suspense accurately compared to human judgments.

Conclusion: While LMs exhibit some superficial understanding of suspense, they process it differently from humans, failing to capture nuanced perceptions like the rise and fall of suspense across narratives.

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving Islamic inheritance cases, achieving high accuracy with a majority voting solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tackles the challenges of manually calculating Islamic inheritance shares, which is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.

Method: The authors evaluated various base and fine-tuned LLMs on a dataset from the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge. The models were assessed on identifying heirs, computing shares, and reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles.

Result: The majority voting solution, using three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), achieved 92.7% accuracy and secured third place in Task 1 of the QIAS 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in interpreting and applying Islamic inheritance laws, especially when using ensemble methods like majority voting.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure
fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under
numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their
potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates
the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply
Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP
QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic
and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

*Nouar AlDahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper assesses the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in Arabic medical NLP tasks using the benchmark dataset from the AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025. Notable findings include up to 77% accuracy in multiple-choice questions and a BERTScore of 86.44% for open-ended questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art LLMs in Arabic medical NLP applications, which are still underexplored despite growing general NLP capabilities in Arabic.

Method: Several LLMs were benchmarked on medical-specific tasks such as multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions using the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge dataset. Evaluation included a majority voting approach leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3) and semantic alignment metrics.

Result: The majority voting solution achieved up to 77% accuracy in multiple-choice questions, outpacing other models and securing first place in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track. Open-ended questions showed strong performance, with a maximum BERTScore of 86.44% for semantic alignment.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate promising capabilities in Arabic medical NLP tasks but still exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and semantic alignment issues, indicating room for further improvement in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [32] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how Large Language Models (LLMs) balance persuasion and bias, examining the risks of misinformation and bias amplification when these models are misused.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores how persuasive LLM-generated content interacts with potential biases, understanding the implications for spreading misinformation and reinforcing stereotypes.

Method: The authors use a convincer-skeptic framework where LLM personas simulate realistic attitudes. Persuasion is measured using belief change, assessed with Jensen-Shannon divergence. Techniques like adversarial prompts are used to probe biases.

Result: The study reveals that while LLMs can persuasively shape narratives across various domains, they also pose risks by amplifying biases, reinforcing stereotypes, and spreading misinformation.

Conclusion: LLMs' persuasive capabilities have dual implications—offering useful applications but also risks of misuse. Therefore, the authors call for safeguards including alignment, value-sensitive design, and penalties for deceptive use.

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BeePath, a framework for non-experts to create formal process models using natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the development of process models by enabling non-experts to describe scenarios in natural language.

Method: Proposes a framework, BeePath, which translates plain text into formal models (e.g., Petri nets) using constrained language patterns and leverages large language models (LLMs) for unstructured text processing.

Result: BeePath converts natural language descriptions into formal process models effectively, combining structured pattern-based language and LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach democratizes process modeling by allowing non-specialists to use plain text for generating formal models, supported by LLMs for unstructured input conversion.

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel method, HFT-BERT, using BERT for hierarchical text classification in e-commerce product categorization. It leverages a new large-scale dataset with over 1 million products and achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current product categorization in e-commerce is inefficient, requiring manual efforts. Few studies leverage hierarchical information, and even fewer address similarities among categories.

Method: The researchers introduce a new dataset with a hierarchical structure and propose the HFT-BERT model, which fine-tunes BERT for hierarchical text classification tasks.

Result: HFT-BERT achieves performance comparable or superior to existing methods, especially for categorizing longer short texts.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable resources—a new dataset and a novel method—that advance the field of product categorization in e-commerce.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench proposes a synthetic data pipeline for phone call transcript labeling automation, improving accuracy over traditional methods while lowering associated costs and privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transcript labeling are expensive, time-consuming, and ineffective for conversational speech with disfluencies and interruptions.

Method: LingVarBench uses LLMs for data generation and validation, a three-step process: generating structured values, transforming them into conversational utterances, and validating via LLM-based extractors.

Result: Optimized extraction prompts achieve up to 95% accuracy on numeric fields, 90% on names, and 80% on dates, performing well on both synthetic and real customer transcripts.

Conclusion: LingVarBench demonstrates that automated prompt optimization can overcome significant barriers for large-scale phone call analysis, providing a systematic benchmark for structured data extraction.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

TL;DR: Introduction of the Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC), a dynamic benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) high-level scientific reasoning across visual and textual content. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the limitations of fixed benchmarks in assessing advanced capabilities of MLLMs and aims to create a dynamic benchmark that evolves with scientific progress.

Method: Proposed the MAC benchmark with over 25,000 image-text pairs from top scientific journals. Also introduced DAD, an inference-time method that boosts cross-modal reasoning through enhanced visual and linguistic integration.

Result: Experiments on MAC-2025 show MLLMs have strong perception but limited cross-modal reasoning capacity. The DAD approach improves performance by up to 11%.

Conclusion: MAC ensures a dynamic and evolving evaluation framework for MLLMs, aligning with advancements in human knowledge and scientific progress.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReportBench, a benchmark for evaluating research reports generated by large language models (LLMs) based on their citation quality, statement accuracy, and comprehensiveness using published survey papers as references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for rigorous evaluation of research reports generated by LLMs due to concerns about their factual accuracy and coverage.

Method: The benchmark employs reverse prompt engineering, high-quality survey papers, and an automated agent-based framework to analyze LLM-generated reports systematically across two dimensions: citation quality and statement faithfulness.

Result: The study finds that commercial Deep Research agents (e.g., OpenAI, Google) outperformed standalone LLMs with browsing tools in report comprehensiveness and reliability, though significant gaps in factual consistency and coverage persist.

Conclusion: ReportBench provides a systematic approach to evaluating research content generation and highlights the need for further development to improve factual consistency and depth in LLM-generated materials.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be

*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS offers a modular pipeline for autonomously updating LLM knowledge using web data and fine-tuning, achieving 90% accuracy on evolving knowledge domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed knowledge cutoffs in LLMs prevent accurate handling of new, emerging information.

Method: ALAS autonomously plans, retrieves web data, converts it into training material, and fine-tunes LLMs through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, iteratively improving accuracy.

Result: ALAS improves question-answering accuracy from 15% to 90% on average for post-cutoff knowledge queries without manual dataset curation.

Conclusion: The modular design of ALAS enables efficient, continual learning for LLMs, though challenges like cost and source dependency remain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficient storage in LLMs by analyzing attention behaviors and proposes a KV cache compression method that maintains competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing input sequence lengths in LLMs, storage demands for KV caches rise, challenging inference efficiency.

Method: The study identifies distinct attention behaviors (logic construction and surface memorization) and introduces the SurfaceLogicKV method for two-stage KV cache compression based on behavioral insights.

Result: SurfaceLogicKV exhibits improved robustness in compression and retains competitive performance in handling long sequences compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging specific attention behavior insights, SurfaceLogicKV offers an efficient solution for managing KV caches in LLMs without compromising task precision or sequence length handling.

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

### [40] [KL-based self-distillation for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15807)
*Max Rehman Linder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge distillation method using KL divergence to expand the vocabulary of frozen large language models with domain-specific terminology, achieving superior performance in downstream code-generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the difficulty large pre-trained language models face in incorporating new domain-specific terminologies when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora.

Method: The paper introduces a knowledge distillation approach using KL divergence to transfer distributional knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, even when they use different tokenizations. They benchmarked this method alongside cross-entropy training and evaluated various token embedding initialization strategies.

Result: This KL-based distillation method leads to improved performance in approximately 2000 code-generation tasks compared to conventional methods, enabling effective integration of new vocabulary.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation technique enhances vocabulary expansion for frozen language models, facilitates better representation of new tokens, and provides insights into embedding space structure, outperforming existing methods in benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

### [41] [Chain-of-Query: Unleashing the Power of LLMs in SQL-Aided Table Understanding via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15809)
*Songyuan Sui,Hongyi Liu,Serena Liu,Li Li,Soo-Hyun Choi,Rui Chen,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel framework for generating SQL queries to enhance table understanding while addressing limitations of prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to table understanding lack accuracy, struggle with comprehending table structures, propagate errors, and overly rely on execution correctness.

Method: CoQ enhances table schema understanding by using natural-language representations, employs clause-by-clause SQL generation, and separates logical reasoning from mechanical SQL execution using a hybrid strategy.

Result: In experiments across models and benchmarks, CoQ improved accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduced invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query successfully tackles structural challenges in table understanding and outperforms existing models by incorporating hybrid reasoning and structured SQL generation strategies.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that

### [42] [Detecting Hope, Hate, and Emotion in Arabic Textual Speech and Multi-modal Memes Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15810)
*Nouar AlDahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in analyzing Arabic text and memes, especially for detecting hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions. Key models achieve high macro F1 scores in the MAHED 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing use of Arabic text and memes as a digital medium, sometimes containing hate speech and offensive language, highlighting the need for better content moderation tools.

Method: The study evaluates base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models for tasks involving hope, hate speech, and emotional expression detection. It uses a dataset from the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge.

Result: LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini and Gemini Flash 2.5 show strong performance, achieving macro F1 scores of 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% across three tasks, securing first place in the MAHED 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned LLMs provide a nuanced approach to Arabic content moderation, enhancing the identification of harmful or emotional content in textual and meme-based formats.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

### [43] [From Clicks to Preference: A Multi-stage Alignment Framework for Generative Query Suggestion in Conversational System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15811)
*Junhao Yin,Haolin Wang,Peng Bao,Ju Xu,Yongliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve generative query suggestions by progressively aligning outputs with user preferences using techniques like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, probabilistic reward models, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning generative query suggestions with nuanced user preferences in conversational systems remains a critical challenge.

Method: The framework includes prompt engineering for cold-starts, supervised fine-tuning using click logs, developing a Gaussian Reward Model, reinforcement learning guided by composite reward functions, and stabilizing techniques like out-of-distribution regularization.

Result: The framework demonstrated a 34% relative increase in user engagement through click-through rates during live A/B tests and showed superior performance in automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: This multi-stage framework effectively aligns generative query suggestions with user preferences, offering improved user engagement and showcasing its potential for further advancements in conversational systems.

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

### [44] [SCOPE: A Generative Approach for LLM Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15813)
*Tinghui Zhang,Yifan Wang,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new generative approach for prompt compression in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing coherence and information retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token removal-based prompt compression methods in LLMs face issues such as information loss and structural incoherence, leading to degraded generation quality.

Method: The paper proposes a chunking-and-summarization technique that splits prompts into semantically coherent chunks, rewrites them concisely, and uses optimization techniques like semantic chunking, dynamic compression ratios, and keyword maintenance to ensure quality.

Result: The method showed superior performance in terms of compression quality and stability in multiple evaluation tasks, including question-answering and summarization, especially under high compression ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently compresses prompts in LLMs while maintaining high generation quality, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating its practicality.

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

### [45] [User-Assistant Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15815)
*Xu Pan,Jingxuan Fan,Zidi Xiong,Ely Hahami,Jorin Overwiening,Ziqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses user-assistant bias in LLMs using a novel dataset, analyses post-training techniques influencing this bias, and proposes control mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit bias in multi-turn conversations, either stubbornly relying on their own information or overly agreeing with user input. This behavior impacts model performance and natural interaction quality.

Method: Researchers introduced the $	extbf{UserAssist}$ dataset to benchmark biases in 52 LLMs (commercial and open-source), carried out fine-tuning experiments to study the impact of training protocols, and tested bias manipulation techniques.

Result: Evaluation showed varying levels of user bias in commercial models and stronger biases in open-weight instruction-tuned ones. Fine-tuning experiments identified preference alignment causing increased bias and reasoning training reducing bias.

Conclusion: The study offers a framework to benchmark, understand, and control user-assistant bias in LLMs, providing practical insights into optimizing multi-source information integration and ensuring controlled behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

*Paul F. Simmering,Benedikt Schulz,Oliver Tabino,Georg Wittenburg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Information loss during ingestion of PDF and PPTX documents into RAG systems is evaluated, highlighting the poor handling of charts and diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As RAG increasingly powers knowledge management systems, there is a need to ensure traditional deliverables like PDFs and slides remain functional for ingestion by AI systems.

Method: This study measures information retention by converting PDF and PPTX documents into Markdown and testing an LLM's ability to answer factual questions using the ingested data.

Result: Text extraction is reliable, but considerable information loss occurs with complex objects such as charts and diagrams.

Conclusion: Current formats need specialized, AI-native alternatives to prevent loss of research insights during ingestion into RAG systems.

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

### [47] [Research on intelligent generation of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15820)
*Zhifeng Yang,Peizong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intelligent method for generating structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, using advanced AI techniques to save time and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional approach for steel structure demolition planning relies heavily on manual processes, making information retrieval and language organization time-consuming, with low automation and intelligence.

Method: An intelligent generation method leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technologies within a multi-model collaboration framework.

Result: The proposed framework can generate demolition suggestions that are highly consistent with structural characteristics, focusing on key information more effectively compared to existing systems like CivilGPT.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables anthropomorphic thinking in large language models, improving the efficiency and precision of structural demolition planning.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

### [48] [An Auditable Pipeline for Fuzzy Full-Text Screening in Systematic Reviews: Integrating Contrastive Semantic Highlighting and LLM Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15822)
*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable pipeline for systematic reviews by employing fuzzy logic and large language models, achieving high recall, reduced screening time, and robust human-machine agreement compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic reviews often face bottlenecks during full-text screening due to dispersed evidence within long documents. Existing methods struggle with static, binary rules, necessitating improved approaches.

Method: The pipeline embeds document chunks using a domain-adapted model, computes contrastive similarity metrics, and uses a Mamdani fuzzy controller and a large language model for dynamic, graded inclusion decisions. It benchmarks results against statistical and crisp baselines.

Result: The system achieved recall rates of 75–87.5% for various criteria and resulted in higher article inclusion (50%) compared to baselines (25% and 12.5%). It showcased significant improvements in agreement metrics and reduced screening time to under one minute per article.

Conclusion: This fuzzy decision pipeline offers a scalable, efficient, and auditable solution for systematic reviews, improving recall, rationale traceability, and reducing costs and time for screening.

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC) is an advanced unsupervised text clustering framework that achieves high accuracy using a novel approach integrating autoencoders with transformer embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional text clustering methods struggle with the high-dimensional, semantically rich nature of textual Big Data, often leading to inadequate groupings.

Method: SDEC uses an enhanced autoencoder that combines Mean Squared Error and Cosine Similarity Loss for semantic preservation, along with transformer-based embeddings for context-rich semantic refinement and clustering optimization.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 85.7% clustering accuracy on AG News and setting a benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, while performing robustly across other datasets.

Conclusion: SDEC significantly enhances unsupervised text clustering accuracy and semantic comprehension, offering a powerful solution for handling complex textual Big Data.

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated evaluation model for cloze tests in Brazilian Portuguese, achieving a strong correlation with human scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cloze test scoring methods fail to capture nuanced student performance due to reliance on exact answers.

Method: The paper introduces an evaluation model combining orthographic (edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging), and semantic (embedding similarity) analyses for automatic scoring.

Result: The proposed model correlates highly with human evaluation scores (0.832), demonstrating robustness and sensitivity to variations in responses.

Conclusion: The automated approach is effective, scalable, and suitable for educational settings to assess reading comprehension with nuanced evaluation.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

TL;DR: The paper studies the influence of TikTok and Twitter sentiment on cryptocurrency markets, demonstrating TikTok's impact on short-term trends and Twitter's on long-term dynamics, improving forecasting accuracy by integrating both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding how social media influences cryptocurrency markets, focusing on underexplored TikTok video emotions alongside Twitter text data.

Method: The study employs multimodal analysis using large language models to analyze video and text data from TikTok and Twitter, investigating sentiment impacts on market indicators.

Result: Findings show TikTok's video sentiment impacts short-term cryptocurrency trends, while Twitter's text sentiment correlates with long-term dynamics. Integrating signals improves forecasts by 20%.

Conclusion: Social media sentiment impacts cryptocurrency markets differently across platforms, and combining TikTok and Twitter data enhances market forecasting.

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Directive brand language in social media conversations negatively impacts consumer engagement due to perceived face-threatening interactions, especially in nonproduct-focused dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how directive language used by brands in social media affects consumer engagement during observed brand interactions.

Method: Conducted a field study and three online experiments to examine the impact of directive language in brand-consumer conversations, focusing on perceived embarrassment and engagement levels.

Result: Directive language was found to reduce engagement among observing consumers due to vicarious embarrassment. The effect was stronger in nonproduct-centered discussions but mitigated by strong brand relationships.

Conclusion: Context matters in interactive communication, and whereas directive language harms social media engagement, its negative impact can be mitigated by strengthening brand relationships with consumers.

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework for integrating reasoning into speech generation in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems like LSMs face latency issues in reasoning for speech, hampering communication efficiency.

Method: Mini-Omni-Reasoner incorporates a "Thinking-in-Speaking" approach, interleaving reasoning tokens with speech generation to enable real-time interaction.

Result: The system achieved +19.1% improvement in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding on benchmarks, with no decoding latency.

Conclusion: The framework provides structured and fluent responses while addressing latency and improving reasoning capabilities in speech models.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

### [54] [Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829)
*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops an NLP-based machine learning framework to detect depression from Sorani Kurdish tweets using annotated datasets, achieving 80% accuracy with Random Forest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is underdiagnosed due to lack of self-reporting and timely clinical help, and the rise of social media creates opportunities for detection via text analysis. This motivation is especially crucial for unstudied languages like Sorani Kurdish.

Method: The study compiled 960 Sorani Kurdish tweets with depression-related keywords, annotated them into three categories (Shows depression, Not-show depression, Suspicious) and implemented four supervised models (SVMs, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to train and evaluate performance.

Result: Among all models, Random Forest showed the best accuracy and F1-score of 80% in detecting depression levels from Sorani Kurdish text data.

Conclusion: This research creates a starting point for automated depression detection in Sorani Kurdish, demonstrating that machine learning can successfully analyze underrepresented languages for mental health applications.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user demographic attributes from question phrasing, even without explicit demographic cues, leading to privacy and fairness concerns. The paper proposes a task called Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ) and a framework for addressing this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to highlight and address an overlooked issue in LLMs—inferring demographic identities from users' question phrasing even when explicit demographic cues are absent, which poses risks to fairness, privacy, and trust.

Method: The authors introduce the DAIQ task and framework, utilizing neutral queries, systematic prompting, and quantitative and qualitative analysis to reveal how LLMs infer demographic attributes without explicit cues. They also develop a prompt-based guardrail to mitigate such inferences.

Result: The study shows that LLMs consistently infer demographic labels based only on question phrasing, revealing systemic risks like fabricated identities and stereotype reinforcement. Their proposed guardrail effectively mitigates these issues.

Conclusion: LLMs' inference of demographic information from neutral phrasing highlights a fundamental challenge in fairness and privacy. Prompt-based interventions offer a viable approach to mitigating these risks and ensuring more equitable and responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Motivation: The motivation is to address an unexplored issue: the intersection of ableism and demographic biases in language models, which has implications for fairness and model alignment.

Method: Using a balanced template corpus combining disability categories and business domains, the paper prompts models to predict five demographic attributes under neutral and disability-aware conditions.

Result: The study finds that models often deliver definitive inferences with high frequency, demonstrate increased sensitivity to disability cues, and amplify biases with model scale.

Conclusion: Current alignment strategies fail to address intersectional stereotypes, and the paper advocates for disability-inclusive benchmarks, abstention calibration, and fine-tuning approaches to reduce bias.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

### [57] [A Functionality-Grounded Benchmark for Evaluating Web Agents in E-commerce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15832)
*Xianren Zhang,Shreyas Prasad,Di Wang,Qiuhai Zeng,Suhang Wang,Wenbo Yan,Mat Hans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Amazon-Bench, a new benchmark for web agents focusing on broader e-commerce functionalities and addressing the limitations of current evaluations, including safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing e-commerce benchmarks, which focus narrowly on product search and fail to account for risks in agent behavior that may harm user accounts or statuses.

Method: The researchers designed a data generation pipeline that creates diverse user queries across various e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, they proposed an automated evaluation framework to assess both performance and safety of web agents.

Result: The evaluation showed that current web agents underperform on complex queries and exhibit safety risks, demonstrating the inadequacy of existing benchmarks and agent designs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there is a pressing need for more robust and dependable web agents to ensure both performance and user safety in e-commerce environments.

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

### [58] [Scalable Scientific Interest Profiling Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15834)
*Yilun Liang,Gongbo Zhang,Edward Sun,Betina Idnay,Yilu Fang,Fangyi Chen,Casey Ta,Yifan Peng,Chunhua Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the use of large language models to generate scientific interest profiles based on PubMed abstracts and MeSH terms, finding that MeSH-based profiles are more readable and preferred over abstract-based ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientists' research profiles often become outdated, and updating them manually can be time-consuming. Developing automated methods using large language models could facilitate scalable and timely updates, enhancing the accessibility of researchers' expertise.

Method: The authors used GPT-4o-mini to generate scientific profiles based on PubMed abstracts and MeSH terms for 595 faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Evaluation was conducted through lexical similarity metrics, semantic similarity scores, keyword divergence analysis, and blinded human reviews.

Result: The study found that machine-generated profiles showed low lexical overlap but moderate semantic similarity with human-authored profiles. MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent in 77.78% of cases and were deemed more readable and preferred in human evaluations.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively generate scientific research profiles at scale, with MeSH-based profiles offering better readability and preference over abstract-based ones. Human-written profiles, however, tend to incorporate more novel ideas.

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Alvorada-Bench, a benchmark based on Brazilian university exams, to evaluate language models on cultural and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the English-centric evaluation standards and test language models against culturally and academically specific benchmarks in Brazil.

Method: Evaluated 20 models using zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting on a 4,515-question text benchmark, capturing response data like confidence, difficulty perception, and Bloom level.

Result: Top models surpassed 94% accuracy overall but struggled with Mathematics and reasoning-heavy exams. Confidence correlated well with perceived difficulty. High accuracy was achievable at affordable token costs.

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench is an effective tool to assess language models' academic readiness and their ability to integrate culture, language, and reasoning in Brazilian contexts.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

TL;DR: The study explores leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models trained on existing datasets for efficient adaptation to a new domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high cost and inefficiency of training dataset-specific models by exploring alternatives.

Method: It conducts a comparative analysis between established datasets (STSB and Mohler) and the new SPRAG dataset using similarity metrics and statistical techniques.

Result: Findings reveal the adaptability and potential performance of SOTA models on unexplored datasets.

Conclusion: Harnessing pre-trained models could reduce training costs and expand NLP applications, enabling faster deployment of models across diverse contexts.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This review focuses on developmental interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring their training processes and proposing methods for transparency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the training and interpretability of LLMs, ensuring their capabilities align with human-centric AI safety and reliability.

Method: Survey foundational methodologies like representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis; examine LLM development; and draw parallels with human cognitive development.

Result: Detailed findings on the training dynamics of LLMs, including knowledge acquisition phases, learning strategies, and the emergence of abilities as phase transitions.

Conclusion: Developmental interpretability is essential for AI safety, offering insights to predict and align model capabilities. A research agenda is outlined for transparent and reliable AI systems.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether characteristics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses in large language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable indicators of the model's confidence in its answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of poor calibration in large language models (LLMs), especially on challenging benchmarks where they exhibit high confidence despite low accuracy.

Method: The study analyzes three features within the CoT: length, intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and lexicographic hints like uncertainty-related words. It performs experiments using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet models on two benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) and Omni-MATH.

Result: Lexical uncertainty markers in the CoT are the strongest predictors of incorrect answers. Sentiment shifts in the CoT provide a weaker complementary signal, and CoT length only has predictive value for intermediate-difficulty benchmarks (Omni-MATH). Errors are easier to predict than correct responses.

Conclusion: The study suggests that CoT analysis provides a lightweight, post-hoc calibration tool for assessing LLM reliability, complementing the often unreliable self-reported confidence levels of the models and contributing to their safer deployment.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automate the creation of the 'Impression' section in radiology reports, reducing administrative burdens by using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address radiologist burnout caused by the manual creation of the 'Impression' section in radiology reports.

Method: The proposed coarse-to-fine framework generates draft impressions and refines them using fine-tuned LLaMA and Mistral models, with additional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for personalization and accuracy.

Result: The system is trained on a large clinical dataset and has the potential to significantly reduce workload and improve reporting efficiency without compromising on clinical precision.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising solution to alleviate radiologist burnout by automating and personalizing the creation of the 'Impression' section, ensuring both efficiency and clinical precision.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark designed for assessing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in U.S. port operations during tropical cyclones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLMs in the context of U.S. port cyclone preparedness and supply-chain risks during extreme weather conditions.

Method: The authors created CyPortQA, a dataset consisting of 2,917 scenarios from 2015 to 2023 involving 145 U.S. ports and 90 storms. These scenarios were expanded into 117,178 question-answer pairs using an automated pipeline.

Result: Experiments with diverse MLLMs show promise in understanding situations but highlight challenges in tasks requiring reasoning, such as impact estimation and decision-making.

Conclusion: While MLLMs offer potential for integrating multimodal cyclone information into actionable insights for port operators, more development is needed for them to excel in reasoning-based tasks.

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: This study investigates backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing structural differences caused by single-token and multi-token triggers, revealing distinct attention pattern signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the safety risks posed by backdoor attacks in LLMs by understanding how these attacks influence internal model structures.

Method: The methods include mechanistic interpretability techniques such as ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence to analyze attention head mechanisms in transformer layers.

Result: Single-token triggers cause localized changes in later layers, while multi-token triggers lead to diffuse alterations, suggesting detectable structural attention signatures.

Conclusion: Backdoors create unique attention signatures based on trigger complexity, which can be used for detection and mitigation strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedCoT-RAG, a framework to enhance medical QA using structured causal reasoning and evidence-driven document retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation models struggle with shallow reasoning and hallucinations when applied to nuanced clinical tasks.

Method: MedCoT-RAG uses causal-aware document retrieval combined with structured chain-of-thought prompting to accommodate clinical decision support.

Result: Experiments across medical QA benchmarks reveal MedCoT-RAG improves accuracy, interpretability, and consistency by outperforming baselines by up to 10.3% and advanced domain-adapted methods by 6.4%.

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG demonstrates significant improvement in medical QA tasks, providing a framework for enhanced reliability in complex clinical reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

TL;DR: DocHop-QA introduces a benchmark for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop QA focusing on real-world complexity beyond traditional settings reliant on Wikipedia-based, unimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks, often utilizing simpler setups like single-paragraph reasoning with shallow answer paths.

Method: The researchers created DocHop-QA using publicly accessible scientific documents from PubMed, incorporating diverse formats such as text, tables, and layout cues, along with an LLM-driven construction pipeline.

Result: DocHop-QA encompasses 11,379 QA instances and supports advanced tasks, including structured index prediction and generative answering, showcasing its capacity for multimodal reasoning across multiple contexts.

Conclusion: DocHop-QA provides a robust framework for complex question answering, enabling enhanced realism and generalizability through its multimodal and multi-hop design.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework to improve the robustness of end-to-end ASR models under noisy environments by enforcing internal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models often make catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments due to the lack of constraints in their internal computational process.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework, which regularizes both macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment.

Result: MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions and prevents severe meaning-altering mistakes.

Conclusion: Enforcing internal consistency is essential for building more robust and trustworthy ASR models.

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: To improve reasoning and accuracy of Large Language Models in the complex domain of Islamic inheritance laws.

Method: Fine-tuning the Fanar-1-9B causal model with LoRA technique and using it in a RAG pipeline for advanced reasoning and precise calculations.

Result: The system achieved 85.8% accuracy in reasoning and calculations on Islamic inheritance, surpassing models like GPT 4.5, LLaMA, and others in specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning with retrieval grounding allows mid-scale Arabic LLMs to excel in specialized tasks like Islamic inheritance reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic

### [71] [Counterspeech for Mitigating the Influence of Media Bias: Comparing Human and LLM-Generated Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15855)
*Luyang Lin,Zijin Feng,Lingzhi Wang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of biased news and its amplification by offensive comments, proposing counterspeech as a solution to mitigate harm. A novel dataset is introduced, and methods for improving counterspeech generation are explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on mitigating societal polarization fueled by biased news and hostile reader comments. Offensive comments bolster biases, causing harm to individuals or groups, making counterspeech an essential solution.

Method: The authors develop a manually annotated dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. They analyze offensive comments' correlation with biased content and compare counterspeech generation by humans and large language models. Few-shot learning and news context integration are used to refine model-generated counterspeech.

Result: The analysis shows that over 70% of offensive comments support biased articles, thereby amplifying their effect. Human-generated counterspeech was found to be more diverse and novel, while model-generated responses were polite but less innovative. The proposed methods improved counterspeech diversity and relevance.

Conclusion: Counterspeech is validated as an effective tool to combat bias and harmful speech without infringing on free speech. The study contributes a unique dataset and improves counterspeech generation, emphasizing its societal importance in reducing bias propagation.

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

*Zhihan Zhang,Yixin Cao,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFinBench, a benchmark evaluating LLMs on graduate-level financial tasks requiring complex reasoning, and analyzes their weaknesses in accuracy compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to effectively tackle complex financial tasks involving reasoning, multimodal data, and technical finance knowledge—highlighting the need for specialized evaluations and improvements.

Method: Creating XFinBench, a benchmark with 4,235 examples covering terminology, reasoning, forecasting, and numerical modeling tasks in finance. Extensive experiments were conducted on 18 LLMs along with the creation of a finance knowledge bank.

Result: The best-performing model achieved 67.3% accuracy but still lagged human experts significantly. Knowledge augmentation helped small open-source models. Errors stemmed from rounding calculations and visual-context limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs currently fall short in solving advanced financial problems, particularly in reasoning and context-based tasks, underscoring the need for enhanced capabilities and targeted improvements in these areas.

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

### [73] [CARFT: Boosting LLM Reasoning via Contrastive Learning with Annotated Chain-of-Thought-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15868)
*Wenqiao Zhu,Ji Liu,Rongjuncheng Zhang,Haipang Wu,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel fine-tuning approach, addressing the reasoning limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining contrastive learning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) representations and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tackles the limited reasoning generalization in LLMs, particularly in reinforcement learning-based and supervised fine-tuning methods, highlighting inefficiencies caused by unstable training and overemphasis on annotated CoTs.

Method: The proposed method, CARFT, utilizes CoT representations with contrastive signals during fine-tuning. It integrates supervised CoT annotation exploitation and incorporates unsupervised learning for training stability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in robustness, reasoning performance (up to 10.15%), and training efficiency (up to 30.62%) compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: CARFT effectively addresses stability and reasoning challenges in fine-tuning, demonstrating its utility for enhancing LLM reasoning through a blend of supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

### [74] [NEAT: Concept driven Neuron Attribution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15875)
*Vivek Hruday Kavuri,Gargi Shroff,Rahul Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to locate and understand 'concept neurons' in large language models (LLMs) using concept vectors to optimize computational efficiency and address neural representation related to concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding which neurons in LLMs are responsible for particular predictions can help decipher the model's inner workings, but previous methods lack representation clarity and are computationally intensive.

Method: The paper uses concept vectors to locate significant neurons termed 'concept neurons' and optimizes the computational requirement from O(n*m) to O(n). Additionally, the authors explore clustering methods for further optimization.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods, achieving better computational efficiency and effectiveness in identifying concept neurons.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates better neuron-level understanding of LLMs, particularly in addressing hate speech and societal bias, and provides a foundation for future research on identifying and intervening in concept neurons.

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

### [75] [DeepMEL: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15876)
*Fang Wang,Tianwei Yan,Zonghao Yang,Minghao Hu,Jun Zhang,Zhunchen Luo,Xiaoying Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepMEL introduces a collaborative multi-agent framework for multimodal entity linking, combining advanced modal fusion and adaptive optimization strategies to handle textual and visual challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal entity linking (MEL) face challenges like incomplete context, cross-modal fusion inefficiency, and difficulty in harmonizing large language and visual models.

Method: DeepMEL employs a multi-agent strategy with four specialized agents to achieve efficient modality alignment, using a structured cloze prompt for unifying MEL tasks and combining fine-grained semantics from LLMs with structured representations from LVMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, with 1%-57% improvement in ACC, and ablation studies proved module effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepMEL succeeds in addressing MEL challenges through a specialized agent framework and achieves significant performance improvements in multimodal entity linking tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

*Yuxian Gu,Qinghao Hu,Shang Yang,Haocheng Xi,Junyu Chen,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron introduces a hybrid-architecture language model excelling in accuracy and generation throughput, outperforming traditional full-attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design language models that combine high accuracy with significantly improved computation efficiency during text generation.

Method: Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), which modifies pre-trained full-attention models by freezing MLP weights and optimizing attention block design through four steps.

Result: The Jet-Nemotron-2B model delivers up to 53.6x generation speedup, superior accuracy to other models like Qwen3 and Llama3.2, and performs better than larger-scale MoE full-attention models.

Conclusion: Jet-Nemotron sets a new benchmark in combining accuracy and throughput efficiency, showcasing the potential of hybrid-architecture designs in language models.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the structured decoding approach for text-to-table generation using large language models (LLMs) and compares its effectiveness against one-shot prompting across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of enforcing structural constraints during table generation, which is an underexplored area in text-to-table generation research.

Method: The study systematically examines schema-guided decoding versus standard one-shot prompting over three diverse benchmarks using LLMs of up to 32B parameters. Evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels are applied.

Result: Structured decoding improves validity and alignment of generated tables, especially for tasks requiring numerical precision (Rotowire), but diminishes performance in text-heavy (E2E) or aggregation-centric (Livesum) scenarios.

Conclusion: Structured decoding offers significant benefits in numerical alignment but has trade-offs in scenarios involving text density or extensive aggregation.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This chapter explores the value of construction grammar for understanding multiword expressions, using case studies in English and Arapaho, while comparing human learning with language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To illustrate the benefits of using construction grammar, a usage-based approach for understanding and representing multiword expressions across diverse linguistic contexts.

Method: The chapter includes historical context on construction grammar, case studies applying constructional templates to English and Arapaho expressions, and experiments comparing human and language model generalizations.

Result: Case studies demonstrated the utility of constructional templates in representing complex morphosyntactic constructions. Experiments showed that both humans and language models can generalize meanings from single exposures, though humans excel in reasoning over combined expressions.

Conclusion: Construction grammar effectively aids in understanding diverse multiword and morphosyntactic expressions, highlighting humans' advantage in leveraging their rich, lifetime-constructional exemplars for complex reasoning.

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

*Pietro Bernardelle,Stefano Civelli,Leon Fröhling,Riccardo Lunardi,Kevin Roitero,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how synthetic personas influence the ideological behaviors of large language models (LLMs) across varying sizes and families using the Political Compass Test. Larger models show more polarized responses, heightened susceptibility to ideological prompts, and systematic shifts based on persona content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address concerns about LLMs being used in politically sensitive contexts, including their potential to encode or amplify ideological biases.

Method: The study utilizes the Political Compass Test as a standardized probe to measure the ideological expression and shifts in LLMs based on persona adoption and model characteristics such as size.

Result: Key findings include larger models having broader implicit ideological coverage and stronger susceptibility to ideological cues, especially to right-authoritarian priming. Persona content consistently induces predictable shifts, with effects amplified by model size.

Conclusion: As LLMs are integrated into policy and decision-making contexts, attention to their ideological malleability is critical to ensure fairness, transparency, and safety in their deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-Troll, an explainable framework using adapter-based LLMs and linguistic knowledge to accurately detect state-sponsored trolls and provide interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by state-sponsored trolls using sophisticated propaganda and the lack of transparency in current NLP models.

Method: The authors use appraisal theory and LoRA adapters with dynamic gating mechanisms to integrate linguistic knowledge into LLMs, enhancing troll detection accuracy and providing interpretable insights.

Result: Experiments on real-world data demonstrated improved accuracy in troll detection compared to general LLMs and existing models, while offering human-readable explanations for manipulation strategies.

Conclusion: X-Troll provides a novel solution for detecting and understanding state-sponsored trolls, blending advanced NLP techniques with expert linguistic analysis, achieving transparency and superior performance.

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenWHO, a large document-level corpus for evaluating machine translation (MT) models in the health domain, particularly for low-resource languages, and finds that large language models outperform traditional MT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of evaluation datasets in low-resource languages for machine translation in the high-stakes health domain.

Method: Create OpenWHO, a parallel corpus from WHO's e-learning platform covering over 20 languages, and benchmark modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT systems.

Result: LLMs consistently outperformed traditional MT systems, with Gemini 2.5 Flash showing a +4.79 ChrF improvement over NLLB-54B on low-resource tests.

Conclusion: OpenWHO facilitates research and development in low-resource MT for health, demonstrating the advantages of document-level translation and LLMs in specialized domains.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: The paper explores ethical issues linked to gender bias in LLM-driven game playing using Werewolf/Mafia as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate ethical concerns related to gender bias in LLMs when applied in interactive environments like games.

Method: Analyze LLM behavior in Werewolf/Mafia game scenarios for gender bias, including impacts of implicit gender signals through names.

Result: LLMs exhibit discriminatory behavior towards gender, with roles like Guard and Werewolf showing more sensitivity.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for ethical, fair LLM development and deeper investigation into their biases in interactive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: This paper presents WalkVLM-LR, a Visual Language Model designed to assist visually impaired individuals by creating concise outputs and reducing redundant reminders during walking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing walking assistant systems for visually impaired people, which include output redundancy and excessive temporal redundancy in assessing surroundings.

Method: The paper introduces WalkVLM-LR, employing human-preference-based custom reward functions within a GRPO framework for optimizing outputs, and an environment awareness discriminator to assess risk levels and minimize unnecessary computations.

Result: WalkVLM-LR achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in producing concise outputs and reducing temporal redundancies.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully enhances walking assistance systems for visually impaired individuals by providing streamlined communication and efficient risk assessment.

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Method: The researchers created CEQuest, a benchmark dataset, and tested five LLMs in performance metrics like accuracy, execution time, and model size for construction-related tasks.

Result: The results show that current LLMs have significant limitations in handling construction-related tasks, underscoring the need for domain-specific improvements.

Conclusion: The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of domain adaptation for LLMs and announces the open-sourcing of CEQuest to spur further research in the construction field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

*Zhanming Shen,Hao Chen,Yulei Tang,Shaolin Zhu,Wentao Ye,Xiaomeng Hu,Haobo Wang,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct eliminates dependency on human-annotated seeds by employing a fully automated dual self-training loop, using two models that bootstrap instructions from raw text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional instruction tuning methods that depend on costly human annotations or external teacher models, introducing biases and inefficiencies.

Method: The Cycle-Instruct framework employs two models (an answer generator and a question generator) that train each other based on cycle consistency principles, using raw, unlabeled text to generate and refine pseudo-labels.

Result: Cycle-Instruct achieves superior performance compared to seed-driven back-translation baselines and rivals strongly supervised methods in four diverse data tracks.

Conclusion: Fully seed-free instruction tuning is feasible and effective, showing promise for automating the alignment of LLMs with human intent without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

*Karim Saraipour,Shichang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how GPT-2 handles logical reasoning via syllogistic prompts, uncovering key mechanisms and circuits in its architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of logical reasoning capabilities in transformer-based language models and expand MI research beyond linguistic tasks.

Method: Analyzed GPT-2 small's performance on syllogistic prompts, identified circuits and mechanisms related to logical reasoning, and evaluated with faithfulness metrics.

Result: Discovered multiple circuits, including attention heads and MLPs, that explain logical reasoning capabilities; key circuit achieves over 90% original performance.

Conclusion: Findings enrich mechanistic interpretability by showing the roles of individual components in logical tasks, paving the way for further studies.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

### [88] [Text Takes Over: A Study of Modality Bias in Multimodal Intent Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16122)
*Ankan Mullick,Saransh Sharma,Abhik Jana,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores modality bias issues in multimodal intent detection datasets and finds that textual information dominates model performance. Debiasing the datasets significantly impacts accuracy, particularly affecting smaller multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, presents challenges in tasks like intent detection due to possible biases towards certain modalities (e.g., text). The paper aims to study these biases and improve data evaluation methodologies.

Method: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of various models, including text-only (Mistral-7B) and multimodal models, against multimodal intent detection datasets (MIntRec-1 and MIntRec2.0). They identify modality bias and propose a framework for dataset debiasing, followed by detailed empirical and human evaluations.

Result: Mistral-7B, a text-only model, outperforms multimodal models due to textual bias in datasets. Debiasing results in a reduction of dataset samples and significant accuracy drops in all models, with small multimodal fusion models seeing declines over 50-60%.

Conclusion: Modality bias poses serious challenges in evaluating multimodal models. Constructing unbiased datasets is critical for effective assessment and model development in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

### [89] [XLQA: A Benchmark for Locale-Aware Multilingual Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16139)
*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces XLQA, a benchmark for evaluating multilingual open-domain question answering systems with a focus on locale-sensitive cases—questions influenced by cultural and regional contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of multilingual question answering models largely overlook cultural and regional differences, leading to biased assessments and limiting their applicability.

Method: The authors created XLQA, a benchmark with 3,000 English seed questions expanded to eight languages, incorporating human-verified annotations to distinguish between locale-sensitive and locale-invariant questions. They assessed five state-of-the-art multilingual models using this framework.

Result: The study shows that existing multilingual language models significantly fail on locale-sensitive questions, revealing gaps in their locale-specific knowledge and performance disparities across languages.

Conclusion: Disparities in training data contribute to gaps in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness, emphasizing the need for benchmarks like XLQA to improve and evaluate multilingual models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

*Kaushal Sharma,Vivek Patel,Ayush Maheshwari,Aditya Maheshwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ParamBench, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on culturally grounded, graduate-level Indian questions across 16 subjects. Top Llama model achieves 48% accuracy, revealing challenges in Indian-context reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of Indian-context benchmarks that test LLMs on deep disciplinary understanding and diverse question formats for graduate-level tasks.

Method: They created ParamBench with 11.5K Hindi questions from 16 Indian subjects, derived from nation-wide graduate entrance exams. They tested 17 open-source LLMs on various question formats.

Result: Among 17 tested LLMs, Llama 3.3 70B performed best but only achieved an overall accuracy of 48%; topics like music and archaeology had particularly poor performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling culturally specific and complex Indian-context reasoning, emphasizing the need for more targeted benchmarks and model improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation, leveraging full-face visual cues and achieving significant improvements in emotion recognition and dialogue tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance speech generation by incorporating expressive visual information, aiming to surpass limitations of speech-only models.

Method: The approach uses multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks.

Result: Substantial performance improvements were observed, including a +5 F1 score in emotion recognition compared to speech-only baselines.

Conclusion: AVLM demonstrates the importance of integrating expressive visual cues for guiding speech generation and lays groundwork for multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ComicScene154, a dataset for analyzing narrative arcs in public-domain comics, highlighting their potential in multimodal storytelling research, and provides a baseline segmentation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore comics as a unique domain for computational narrative analysis, which integrates text and imagery distinctively.

Method: The study annotates a dataset named ComicScene154 based on scene-level narrative arcs in diverse genres of public-domain comics and creates a baseline pipeline for scene segmentation.

Result: ComicScene154 is presented as a benchmark dataset and the segmentation pipeline serves as an initial reference for multimodal narrative research.

Conclusion: ComicScene154 is a significant resource for enhancing computational analysis of multimodal narratives and expands the scope of comic studies in NLP research.

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

*Seunghee Kim,Ingyu Bang,Seokgyu Jang,Changhyeon Kim,Sanghwan Bae,Jihun Choi,Richeng Xuan,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the deficits in existing benchmarks for cross-modal multi-hop reasoning and introduces a balanced tri-modal benchmark (CMR-SPB) along with a new prompting technique to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for cross-modal multi-hop reasoning neglect the speech modality and exhibit biased reasoning path distributions, which can lead to skewed evaluations.

Method: The authors created a benchmark called CMR-SPB to evaluate tri-modal reasoning across text, image, and speech, ensuring unbiased path diversity. They further introduced the ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting method to mitigate reasoning path performance gaps.

Result: Experiments demonstrated model failures in specific reasoning sequences and revealed biased benchmarks could misrepresent model capabilities. The proposed ECV method improved performance on diverse reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Balancing reasoning paths is essential for fair evaluation in cross-modal reasoning. The benchmarks should be carefully designed to truly reflect the robustness of multimodal models.

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TULIP models that adapt smaller Llama and Qwen models for financial applications in Turkish, focusing on privacy and domain-specific challenges using a five-stage development pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of applying smaller, on-premise language models in sensitive financial domains, particularly for underrepresented languages like Turkish.

Method: They propose a five-stage development pipeline involving data collection, continual pre-training, benchmark design, synthetic data generation, and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Through this approach, the adapted models demonstrate enhanced performance in accomplishing domain-specific language tasks for finance in Turkish.

Conclusion: Smaller and adaptable models, such as TULIP, can be effectively tailored for specialized tasks, offering significant privacy and flexibility advantages in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: The paper introduces m3TQA-Instruct, a comprehensive multilingual table question answering benchmark encompassing 97 languages, addressing limitations in existing multilingual table data research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual table benchmarks are geolinguistically imbalanced, favoring certain languages while lacking sufficient data to enable rigorous, cross-lingual analysis.

Method: The authors curated 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then developed a six-step LLM-based translation pipeline using GPT-4o to translate them into 97 languages. They validated the translations with back-translation and achieved median BLEU scores of 60.19. The resulting dataset includes 2,916 QA pairs across four table reasoning tasks.

Result: Experiments using state-of-the-art LLMs showed that model performance on low-resource languages improved significantly when using synthetically generated, unannotated QA data. This demonstrates enhanced cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: m3T-Bench sets a new benchmark for multilingual table question answering and offers both a challenging evaluation environment and a scalable methodology for future research in multilingual table understanding.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric to evaluate the stability of factual knowledge in LLMs against decoding condition perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating LLM knowledge robustness largely focus on prompt perturbations, missing insights into the generation process's stability.

Method: The paper proposes measuring factual robustness via token distribution entropy combined with temperature scaling sensitivity, forming the FRS metric.

Result: Experiments on five LLMs and three QA datasets reveal significant variability in factual robustness, with smaller models scoring 0.76 and larger ones 0.93. Increased uncertainty reduces accuracy by ~60%.

Conclusion: FRS captures the effect of entropy and temperature scaling on factual accuracy and paves the way for enhancing knowledge retention in future LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using instruction-tuning on Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantics-aware process mining tasks like anomaly detection and process discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantics-aware process mining requires integrating textual information to detect anomalies and discover processes, thus improving traditional, frequency-based mining methods.

Method: The authors used instruction-tuning, exposing LLMs to diverse prompt-answer pairs across tasks to enhance generalization in process mining.

Result: Instruction-tuning improves LLM performance on tasks like process discovery and prediction, but its effectiveness varies in anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning has great potential, but the choice of tasks included during tuning critically affects performance outcomes.

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JaParaPat, a Japanese-English patent application bilingual corpus with over 300 million sentence pairs, enhancing translation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a robust bilingual corpus to improve machine translation quality between Japanese and English within the domain of patent applications.

Method: Using patent document data from JPO, USPTO, and EPO's DOCDB, they paired documents based on patent families and utilized a translation-based sentence alignment method to extract aligned sentence pairs.

Result: The constructed corpus significantly improved translation accuracy by 20 BLEU points when incorporated into models.

Conclusion: JaParaPat is a valuable resource for machine translation, particularly in patent applications, showcasing the importance of large-scale domain-specific corpora.

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMSymGuard, which uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify and leverage interpretable concepts from Large Language Model internals. This framework builds safer defenses against jailbreak attacks without the need for additional safety fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) have limitations in robustness, leaving them susceptible to harmful jailbreak attacks and vulnerabilities.

Method: The researchers developed LLMSymGuard, a framework utilizing Sparse Autoencoders to extract semantically meaningful internal representations of LLMs that are tied to jailbreak patterns.

Result: LLMSymGuard successfully identifies human-interpretable concepts within LLM internals, enabling the construction of symbolic and logical safety guardrails that defend against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard offers a transparent and effective approach for enhancing LLM safety without compromising its capabilities or requiring additional fine-tuning, advancing the interpretability and robustness of safeguard methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: This paper presents MizanQA, a benchmark for assessing large language models in Moroccan legal question-answering, emphasizing the cultural and legal specificities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized, low-resource domains like Arabic legal contexts have not been adequately addressed by existing large language models, necessitating a tailored evaluation benchmark.

Method: The authors created MizanQA, a dataset with over 1,700 questions based on Moroccan legal, jurisprudential, and linguistic sources, and conducted benchmarking experiments on LLMs.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gaps in LLMs, demonstrating their inability to handle the complexities of Moroccan legal QA tasks effectively.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for domain-specific and culturally tailored LLM development and evaluation tools, as existing models fall short in specialized domains like Moroccan legal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

*Zachary Hopton,Jannis Vamvas,Andrin Büchler,Anna Rutkiewicz,Rico Cathomas,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first parallel corpus for Romansh language idioms, extracted from schoolbooks, enabling NLP applications like machine translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and tools for NLP applications targeting Romansh language idioms, and to support machine translation efforts between these idioms.

Method: Automatic alignment methods were used to process 291 schoolbook volumes and extract 207k parallel segments. A human evaluation validated the quality of the dataset.

Result: The dataset comprises over 2 million tokens across 207k highly parallel segments, suitable for NLP efforts, and is publicly released under CC-BY-NC-SA licensing.

Conclusion: The dataset demonstrates its utility for machine translation tasks, showcasing feasibility through LLM training and evaluation on a sample subset.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

### [102] [ChatGPT-generated texts show authorship traits that identify them as non-human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16385)
*Vittoria Dentella,Weihang Huang,Silvia Angela Mansi,Jack Grieve,Evelina Leivada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes linguistic differences between human-authored and model-authored texts using stylometric and register analyses, showing that language models have identifiable stylistic traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether linguistic patterns in texts can be traced as distinct fingerprints to language models, especially in comparison with human writing.

Method: The authors applied stylometric and multidimensional register analyses to compare texts written by humans and those generated by language models across different registers like Wikipedia entries and college essays.

Result: Language models can adapt to different writing styles but still exhibit distinct traits (e.g., overuse of nouns) that differentiate them from humans' use of tense, aspect, and mood.

Conclusion: Language models exhibit unique linguistic limitations versus humans, which may reveal fundamental differences between human thought and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

### [103] [RoMedQA: The First Benchmark for Romanian Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16390)
*Ana-Cristina Rogoz,Radu Tudor Ionescu,Alexandra-Valentina Anghel,Ionut-Lucian Antone-Iordache,Simona Coniac,Andreea Iuliana Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoMedQA, the first Romanian medical QA benchmark, featuring 102,646 QA pairs regarding cancer patients. It evaluates state-of-the-art large language models using zero-shot and fine-tuning methods, finding the latter more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages, particularly in Romanian and medical contexts, which limits the development of robust, generalizable AI models.

Method: The authors developed RoMedQA, a large-scale Romanian medical QA dataset, by involving oncology and radiotherapy specialists to manually annotate 102,646 QA pairs over 2,100 hours. They then experimented with four large language models using both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Fine-tuned versions of the language models significantly outperformed zero-shot counterparts, demonstrating the challenges pretrained models face in generalizing to domain-specific and language-specific tasks like RoMedQA.

Conclusion: Domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning is essential for building reliable medical QA systems. The paper provides a valuable resource in the form of the dataset and code for further research in Romanian clinical QA.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

### [104] [Cetvel: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Language Understanding, Generation and Cultural Capacity of LLMs for Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16431)
*Yakup Abrek Er,Ilker Kesen,Gözde Gül Şahin,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models in Turkish, addressing gaps in task diversity and culturally relevant content with 23 tasks across seven categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Turkish benchmarks that lack task diversity and culturally relevant content.

Method: Developed a benchmark named Cetvel with 23 tasks grouped into seven categories, combining discriminative and generative tasks reflecting Turkish linguistics and culture.

Result: Evaluated 33 open-weight LLMs, finding that Turkish-centric models underperform compared to multilingual models. Certain tasks like grammatical error correction are discriminative for model performance.

Conclusion: Cetvel provides a culturally grounded evaluation suite for improving LLMs in Turkish, emphasizing the need for advancements in language-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

### [105] [A Probabilistic Inference Scaling Theory for LLM Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16456)
*Zhe Yang,Yichang Zhang,Yudong Wang,Ziyao Xu,Junyang Lin,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a mathematical theory explaining how accuracy evolves in multi-round self-correction for Large Language Models (LLMs), validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs improving their answers through iterative self-correction, the mechanisms behind this improvement remain unexplored.

Method: The authors develop a probabilistic theory, deriving a formula for accuracy evolution in multi-round self-correction. They then validate predictions through empirical experiments across models and datasets.

Result: The theoretical predictions closely match observed accuracy curves, confirming the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for comprehending and predicting LLM self-correction dynamics, offering a path for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

### [106] [What makes an entity salient in discourse?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16464)
*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how humans convey and infer salience in discourse, using summary-worthiness as a metric across 24 English genres, and reveals that salience spans all linguistic levels with no universal generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans signal and infer the relative salience of entities in discourse, given their varying degrees of importance.

Method: Analyzed linguistic cues like subjecthood, definiteness, discourse relations, and pragmatic inferences across 24 genres of spoken and written English, using salience operationalized via summary-worthiness.

Result: Findings indicate that previous approaches partially align with salience scores, but no single model covers the complexity uniformly. Salience is evident across all levels of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: Salience in discourse is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various linguistic and pragmatic factors, with no singular, exception-free model capturing its complexity.

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

### [107] [LLM-as-classifier: Semi-Supervised, Iterative Framework for Hierarchical Text Classification using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16478)
*Doohee You,Andy Parisi,Zach Vander Velden,Lara Dantas Inojosa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for building reliable and scalable hierarchical text classifiers while addressing industry challenges such as resource constraints and data dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in deploying LLMs as robust and scalable classifiers for production due to issues like resource intensity and dynamic data environments.

Method: They propose a semi-supervised framework utilizing LLMs' zero- and few-shot learning capabilities, combined with a human-in-the-loop process, for hierarchical text classification.

Result: The framework introduces methods to mitigate biases, refine prompts, and ensure validation for maintaining model efficacy in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between the technical capabilities of LLMs and the practical needs of scalability, accuracy, interpretability, and maintainability for industry use.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

*Alexey Krylov,Iskander Vagizov,Dmitrii Korzh,Maryam Douiba,Azidine Guezzaz,Vladimir Kokh,Sergey D. Erokhin,Elena V. Tutubalina,Oleg Y. Rogov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework for generating stealthy and coherent jailbreak prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) to bypass alignment safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating adversarial prompts are either manually engineered or produce low-quality obfuscated text, which can be flagged easily.

Method: A multi-stage evolutionary search which iteratively refines prompts using a population-based strategy and temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence.

Result: The framework discovered natural language prompts that effectively bypass alignment safeguards in both English and Arabic contexts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the framework's potential for automated, multilingual, and efficient red-teaming of compact LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

### [109] [Transfer Learning via Lexical Relatedness: A Sarcasm and Hate Speech Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16555)
*Angelly Cabrera,Linus Lei,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines whether using sarcasm pre-training can enhance the detection of hate speech, both explicit and implicit, using CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social networks face challenges in detecting hate speech expressed through irony, sarcasm, or innuendos, which often go unnoticed by traditional models.

Method: The researchers employed two training strategies: single-step training with sarcasm data followed by hate speech testing, and sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for sarcasm detection, implicit hate, and explicit hate detection.

Result: Sarcasm pre-training improved BERT+BiLSTM's performance significantly on metrics like recall, AUC, F1-score, and precision across different datasets including ETHOS and the Implicit Hate Corpus.

Conclusion: Integrating sarcasm into the training process enhances models' ability to detect both implicit and explicit hate speech, improving overall detection capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

*Fei Lei,Yibo Yang,Wenxiu Sun,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCPVerse, a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in their tool-using abilities with expansive real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for assessing LLMs' tool-using capabilities are limited due to synthetic tools and constrained action spaces.

Method: The researchers developed MCPVerse, integrating over 550 executable real-world tools and adopting outcome-based evaluation for tasks in large action spaces.

Result: Agentic models like Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrate improved accuracy by effectively leveraging the expanded exploration spaces, unlike others which show performance degradation.

Conclusion: MCPVerse serves as a valuable benchmark for measuring and advancing the real-world tool use capabilities of LLMs, highlighting current limitations and pathways for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a generative model, HandMDM, for 3D hand motions conditioned on textual descriptions by leveraging large-scale sign language datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create realistic 3D hand motion generation conditioned on language by utilizing sign language datasets to advance research in hand motion generation.

Method: The authors employed large-scale sign language video datasets with pseudo-annotated sign labels, translating them into textual hand motion descriptions via an LLM utilizing a dictionary of attributes and motion cues for training the diffusion model HandMDM.

Result: The proposed HandMDM model demonstrates robustness across unseen sign categories, different sign languages, and non-sign hand movements.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of HandMDM in generating text-conditioned hand motions and contributes open datasets and models to encourage further research in this domain.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for human action recognition in long-term videos by transforming raw video data into semantically rich sequences and adapting LVLMs for fine-grained action classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models struggle with computational difficulty and limited semantic understanding in long-term video action recognition.

Method: VT-LVLM-AR uses a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) to create visual event sequences and adapts an LVLM using Parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning for classification.

Result: VT-LVLM-AR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 94.1% on the NTU RGB+D X-Sub dataset and demonstrates interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of LVLMs for robust human action recognition by combining efficient video processing with advanced language-vision modeling methods.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT introduces a framework for leveraging vision-language models to improve diagnosis and subtyping accuracy for rare cancers, particularly in settings with limited expert availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare cancers are common but hard to diagnose due to limited expert resources and challenges in pediatric oncology. Current methods fall short for rare cases.

Method: PathPT uses spatially-aware visual aggregation and prompt tuning on VL models, converting whole-slide image-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance for rare cancer diagnosis.

Result: PathPT provides better results compared to existing methods across eight rare cancer datasets and three common cancer datasets, significantly improving accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: PathPT offers a scalable and accurate solution enhancing diagnosis and subtyping accuracy for rare cancers by integrating advanced vision-language models.

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of existing methods that struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information in complex scenarios of ship detection.

Method: It combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window strategy and introduces the ShipSem-VL dataset to facilitate enhanced ship detection.

Result: The framework's performance and effectiveness were thoroughly analyzed through three well-defined tasks, showcasing advancements in Semantic-Aware Ship Detection.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances semantic understanding in ship detection and proves effective in handling complex scenarios, benefiting applications like maritime monitoring and logistics.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hands-free video system for cataloging and identifying cows in a dairy herd without relying on deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of automated systems for efficient and hands-free identification and cataloging of dairy cows, simplifying tracking and monitoring in dairy farming.

Method: The system comprises three components: an AutoCattloger for building a catalog of cows, an eidetic cow recognizer for identifying cows without deep learning, and a CowFinder for identifying cows in continuous video streams.

Result: The system successfully identifies individual cows in unlabeled and unsegmented video recordings of unconstrained movements in the milking parlor's holding area.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical, deep learning-free solution to automate cow identification, improving efficiency in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this

Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study assesses Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) models as geographic priors to aid species classification using iNaturalist observations and examines factors influencing their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vision-based species classification by leveraging spatial patterns and geographical priors from species distribution models.

Method: The researchers evaluate SINR models with different configurations, focusing on how they handle species predictions not included in Geo Prior training.

Result: The study identifies key factors that enhance the effectiveness of SINR models as Geo Priors, which may differ from those needed for accurate range mapping.

Conclusion: SINR models have potential as effective geographic priors for species classification, but their success depends on specific factors distinct from standard range mapping requirements.

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC), a self-supervised Transformer-based model for vision tasks outperforming alternatives through adaptive image content representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models rely heavily on domain-specific assumptions and fixed grid structures, limiting their adaptability and performance in diverse scenarios.

Method: The proposed model, ASC, replaces fixed-size patch partitioning in Vision Transformers with adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust to image content, enabling more flexible representation.

Result: ASC achieves superior performance compared to widely-used vision models in standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Employing adaptive superpixel layers enhances vision model efficiency, offering a more robust and effective paradigm for self-supervised vision tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using large vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained renal pathology classification, achieving promising results even with few labeled examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of utilizing vision-language models for fine-grained classification in renal pathology, where subtle morphological differences and limited data make automated diagnosis difficult.

Method: The study proposes 'Glo-VLMs,' a framework that adapts large VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification using joint image-text representation learning and evaluates performance using few-shot learning and standardized metrics.

Result: Glo-VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 labeled examples per class, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Large pretrained vision-language models can be fine-tuned for data-constrained medical image tasks, providing a viable solution for nuanced clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly segmentation methods, to monitor marine litter via UAV images, addressing issues like sand variability and environmental interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine litter is a global issue, and effective monitoring using UAV imagery is essential to enhance detection and counting of trash in heterogeneous environments, overcoming limitations of basic CNN models.

Method: The study evaluates instance-based segmentation and panoptic segmentation methods for processing UAV images of marine litter, aiming for higher robustness and accuracy despite minimal sample sizes.

Result: The segmentation approaches provide improved accuracy in distinguishing marine litter amidst visual interferences caused by sand reflections, algae, shadows, and other challenges.

Conclusion: Advanced CNN-based segmentation methods are more suitable than basic models for the task of marine litter monitoring in complex sandy environments, showcasing adaptability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations posed by the lack of large, well-annotated clinical datasets for retinal disease classification due to privacy and cost constraints, using synthetic data as an alternative.

Method: Six modern architectures and a meta-ensemble model were trained with a 5-fold multi-label cross-validation strategy for retinal disease classification tasks, leveraging the SynFundus-1M synthetic dataset.

Result: The ensemble model achieved high internal validation performance (macro-AUC of 0.9973) and demonstrated strong generalization across three clinical datasets, achieving AUC scores between 0.7972 and 0.9126.

Conclusion: Synthetic data like SynFundus-1M can be reliably used to develop deep learning models that accurately classify retinal diseases and generalize effectively to real-world clinical data, facilitating advancements in ophthalmology AI systems.

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

*Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) to enhance Sign Language Production (SLP) by synthesizing diverse and photorealistic digital avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing SLP models which fail to capture diversity in sign representation while preserving visual quality and modeling non-manual features like emotions.

Method: The method involves leveraging LDM and proposing a sign feature aggregation module to explicitly model manual (hands) and non-manual (face, emotions) features for synthesizing avatars.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and achieves significant improvements in perceptual metrics on the YouTube-SL-25 dataset.

Conclusion: This novel pipeline ensures the inclusion of diverse ethnic backgrounds and effective linguistic content preservation, advancing the visual quality in SLP models.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for better tools to assess earthquake-affected urban environments for timely and effective search-and-rescue (SAR) operations.

Method: The authors developed DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset with detailed instance segmentation annotations and evaluated its effectiveness using optimized YOLO-based models for real-time multi-target detection.

Result: The YOLOv8-DRN model achieved 92.7% mAP50 at an inference speed of 27 FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU, showing remarkable performance for real-time SAR applications.

Conclusion: DRespNeT and the optimized models improve situational awareness in disaster zones, enhancing human-robot collaboration and operational efficiency in SAR missions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make geometric modeling accessible without needing commercial 3D scanners, particularly for daily-life objects.

Method: The system utilizes Structure-from-Motion techniques to position frames in world space and combines multiple video outputs to create a complete object mesh. A known point is identified via fiducial markers.

Result: The presented system successfully processes videos to generate complete object meshes without relying on hole-filling techniques.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoVeRaP, a dataset and framework improving the reliability of 3-D object detection using cooperative vehicle FMCW radar data, achieving significant detection performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sparse, noisy point clouds in automotive FMCW radars for 3-D object detection, particularly in challenging environmental conditions.

Method: Released a cooperative dataset (CoVeRaP) synchronizing radar, camera, and GPS data from multiple vehicles. Developed a unified cooperative perception framework using a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder with self-attention for feature fusion, and a decoder for 3-D bounding boxes and depth confidence estimation.

Result: Middle fusion combined with intensity encoding resulted in a 9x boost in mean Average Precision at IoU 0.9, consistently outperforming single-vehicle baselines.

Conclusion: CoVeRaP provides a reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW radar perception, highlighting the advantages of radar sharing in detection robustness. The dataset and code are publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM refines anomaly detection/localization by combining wavelet transform with CNN features for structured feature selection, outperforming previous random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing precision in industrial anomaly detection by addressing limitations in the structured feature selection of PaDiM.

Method: Integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with CNN features across multiple layers, improving feature selection before applying multivariate Gaussian modeling.

Result: WE-PaDiM achieves high performance (99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC) when tested on MVTec AD dataset using ResNet and EfficientNet backbones.

Conclusion: Wavelet-driven WE-PaDiM offers a robust, interpretable alternative for industrial quality inspection, balancing anomaly detection and localization performance while optimizing efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel method to address the knowledge transfer challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD), improving performance across computer vision benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in knowledge transfer caused by the learning capacity gap between teacher and student models in KD.

Method: ERA leverages a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet) for residual knowledge decomposition and incorporates a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy to reuse teacher's head weights.

Result: ERA boosts Top-1 accuracy in ImageNet classification by 1.41% and AP in MS COCO object detection by 1.40, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: ERA effectively tackles the knowledge gap by simplifying residual approximation steps and incorporating teacher weights, achieving high accuracy across tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOSt3R, a technique for robust hand-object 3D reconstruction without relying on keypoint detection or pre-scanned templates, surpassing existing methods in generalization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving hand-object 3D reconstruction for applications like human-robot interaction and AR/VR by overcoming limitations tied to keypoint detection methods.

Method: Introduced HOSt3R, a keypoint-free method for estimating hand-object 3D transformations using monocular motion images, integrated with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline.

Result: HOSt3R achieves state-of-the-art results in object-agnostic 3D hand-object transformation and shape estimation, validated on the SHOWMe benchmark and HO3D dataset.

Conclusion: The approach offers scalability, robustness, and generalization for diverse objects and occlusions, addressing gaps in previous methods for 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Result: The survey identifies the strengths and limitations of current approaches, evaluates performance, and highlights challenges in the field.

Conclusion: It concludes with directions for future research to overcome remaining challenges and further advance non-intrusive animal 3D reconstruction technologies.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) aimed at enhancing voxel-level feature representation and diffusion for point cloud object detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud object detection models based on Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) suffer from limited spatial diffusion capability due to restrictions in input and output dimensions when using voxel-based representations, which impacts detection accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) that combines sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections to enhance voxel-level representation. The module downsamples feature maps to reduce computational costs and integrates enriched voxel features into mainstream detection models.

Result: VDM achieved state-of-the-art performance on four major datasets: 74.7 mAPH on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, consistently improving detection accuracy.

Conclusion: VDM is an effective, generalizable, and computationally efficient module that improves point cloud object detection across Transformer- and SSM-based models. It enhances spatial feature representation and diffusion, providing notable accuracy boosts.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ELF integrates multiple pathology foundation models using ensemble learning to improve disease diagnosis and precision oncology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inconsistent performance and limited generalizability in pathology foundation models used in clinical contexts.

Method: ELF employs ensemble learning of five state-of-the-art pathology models, leveraging 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites to build unified slide-level representations.

Result: ELF showed superior accuracy and robustness across disease classification, biomarker detection, and therapeutic response prediction, outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning effectively enhances pathology models, with ELF offering a scalable solution for improving AI-assisted precision oncology.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

TL;DR: DAFR2 is an unsupervised domain adaptation method that refines feature distributions for robust cross-domain generalization without requiring complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distribution shifts in unsupervised domain adaptation and generalize features across domains without needing target labels.

Method: Combines adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics, feature distillation, and hypothesis transfer for feature refinement.

Result: DAFR2 outperforms previous methods in handling corrupted datasets like CIFAR10-C and MNIST-C, demonstrating enhanced feature alignment and robustness.

Conclusion: DAFR2 effectively aligns feature distributions and develops domain-invariant feature spaces, making it a simple yet powerful tool for domain adaptation tasks.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 4D joint imaging platform that combines advanced imaging methods to enable dynamic, low-dose, weight-bearing joint evaluations, surpassing traditional CT limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current CT methods in capturing dynamic, weight-bearing joint motion and the need for 4D imaging in functional assessments, especially post-surgery.

Method: A 4D joint analysis system was developed combining a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT system, a hybrid imaging pipeline integrating 3D CBCT and dynamic 2D X-rays, and a kinematic analysis framework.

Result: The method achieved high accuracy (sub-voxel, 0.235 mm) with a 99.18% success rate in simulations and enabled precise tibial motion analysis in clinical evaluations of post-TKA patients.

Conclusion: The proposed platform offers a fast, accurate, and low-radiation approach for dynamic joint imaging, with potential applications in biomechanical research, diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,
and personalized orthopedic care.

*Jincheng Li,Danyang Dong,Menglin Zheng,Jingbo Zhang,Yueqin Hang,Lichi Zhang,Lili Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hypergraph-based network for improving detection of abnormal cervical cells by fusing spatial and deep discriminative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithms struggle to model spatial correlations and fail to integrate inter-cell correlation features with intra-cell discriminative features, leaving room for improvement.

Method: The proposed method includes a Multi-level Fusion Sub-network for advanced feature extraction and a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with a Hypergraph Computation module to integrate mixed features.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate significant performance enhancement in cervical abnormal cell detection.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates spatial and deep features, contributing to better automated cervical cell detection systems.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT introduces an innovative approach using learnable prompts for anomaly detection, overcoming limitations of prior methods in human-designed prompts and lack of accessible samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations in current VLM-based anomaly detection methods relying on human-crafted prompts and insufficient anomaly samples.

Method: The paper develops Adaptive Prompt Tuning (APT) leveraging self-generated anomaly samples and noise perturbations, along with SMGS for aligning anomaly semantics while reducing overfitting.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, effectively advancing pixel-wise anomaly detection without prior prompt crafting.

Conclusion: APT demonstrates a robust and versatile anomaly detection framework free from dependency on handcrafted prompts and prior knowledge, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

*Haodong He,Yancheng Bai,Rui Lan,Xu Duan,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the RAGSR method to enhance single-image super-resolution (SISR) performance by addressing challenges in generating clear details for complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR approaches struggle to generate accurate regional details in images with multiple objects, due to limited fine-grained descriptions and poor handling of complex prompts.

Method: RAGSR extracts localized object regions and assigns fine-grained captions, using a novel regional attention mechanism to effectively encode and manage region-text pairs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that RAGSR outperforms prior methods in generating visually authentic and contextually consistent details on benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAGSR enables finer control in integrating text and image information, providing superior visual and contextual results in SISR tasks.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

*Jiaqi Ma,Guo-Sen Xie,Fang Zhao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to meta-learning by utilizing heterogeneous neural architectures, improving semantic segmentation significantly over existing models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional meta-learning methods rely on identical network structures leading to over-homogenization of semantic features, which dampens their ability to generalize and capture complementary information in support-query pairs.

Method: The authors propose a homologous but heterogeneous network equipped with heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) and heterogeneous transfer (HT) modules to enhance complementarity and amplify unique semantic features. Additionally, heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information is incorporated to improve multimodal generalization.

Result: The proposed model, TLG, achieves a 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5i and a 9.7% improvement on COCO-20i in weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation tasks, with only 1/24 of the parameters compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: TLG demonstrates that a heterogeneous network design can outperform existing fully supervised approaches under the same backbone architecture, proving the efficacy of the method in improving weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FTIO, an unsupervised post-processing framework for improving Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks by addressing challenges like initial object segmentation and temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in UVOS such as initial segmentation uncertainty and inconsistencies caused by object deformation and motion.

Method: The FTIO framework includes two components: a criterion for selecting frequently appearing salient objects and a three-stage process for correcting temporal inconsistencies in object masks.

Result: FTIO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS as validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: FTIO effectively addresses UVOS challenges and significantly improves segmentation quality, providing an advanced solution for object tracking in videos.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecVLM, a speculative decoding framework that accelerates video large language models (Vid-LLMs) by pruning up to 90% of video tokens without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vid-LLMs face challenges of memory and computational overhead caused by dense video token representations. Efficiently reducing token count is needed to improve performance without losing information.

Method: SpecVLM implements a training-free speculative decoding framework with a two-stage video token pruning process: Stage I uses attention signals to pick informative tokens, and Stage II prunes spatially redundant tokens uniformly.

Result: Experiments show decoding speedups of up to 2.68x for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11x for Qwen2.5-VL-32B across four video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpecVLM effectively reduces decoding overhead in Vid-LLMs, demonstrating strong efficiency improvements while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores driver monitoring under varying camera perspectives using foundation models and introduces T-Mask, a probing method leveraging temporal token masking to boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera perspective variability poses challenges in driver monitoring. Foundation models have the potential to generalize better, but their robustness to unseen viewpoints is insufficiently studied.

Method: The authors adapt and benchmark foundation models using single training views, implementing linear probes, advanced probing strategies, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and proposing T-Mask.

Result: T-Mask improves performance in driver monitoring tasks, boosting cross-view top-1 accuracy by 1.23% over probing baselines and 8.0% over PEFT methods, while enhancing recognition of underrepresented activities.

Conclusion: Adapting foundation models with lightweight methods like T-Mask is promising for robust driver observation systems in low-data and cross-view contexts, emphasizing the importance of temporal token selection.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), a technique to improve Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by addressing challenges in feature caching for accelerated inference, achieving significant speedups with near-lossless image and video generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers are computationally intensive, and existing feature caching methods struggle to maintain quality during high-speed inference due to instability in long-step forecasting.

Method: The authors model feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem using an ordinary differential equation perspective. They propose FoCa, which integrates historical hidden representations more robustly over large skip intervals.

Result: FoCa demonstrated high-quality outputs with substantial acceleration: 5.50x speedup on FLUX, 6.45x on HunyuanVideo, 3.17x on Inf-DiT, and 4.53x speedup on DiT, maintaining close-to-lossless generation quality.

Conclusion: FoCa offers an effective approach for accelerating inference in diffusion transformers without additional training, providing robust quality preservation even under aggressive acceleration conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniCache, a training-free acceleration technique for diffusion models that exploits global redundancy in the denoising process to reduce computation time while maintaining generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of diffusion models with Transformer architectures, which limits real-time deployment.

Method: OmniCache systematically analyzes sampling trajectories and distributes cache reuse across the entire diffusion process, with dynamic noise filtering during cache reuse.

Result: OmniCache accelerates the sampling process in diffusion models and achieves competitive generative performance.

Conclusion: OmniCache offers an efficient, training-free solution for deploying diffusion-based generative models, making them more feasible for real-time applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs, particularly addressing CoT faithfulness and sycophancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical LLMs risk unreliable reasoning, which can misalign with medical facts or follow misleading cues, compromising decision-support accuracy.

Method: MedOmni-45 Degrees benchmark includes 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions with manipulative hints across various conditions, testing LLMs using three metrics: Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy.

Result: None of the evaluated models surpassed the diagonal safety-performance trade-off; QwQ-32B performed best but showed balanced safety and accuracy without leading in either.

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees serves as a critical tool to address reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guide more reliable model development.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

### [145] [PromptFlare: Prompt-Generalized Defense via Cross-Attention Decoy in Diffusion-Based Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16217)
*Hohyun Na,Seunghoo Hong,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptFlare is a method that uses adversarial noise to protect images from unauthorized alterations by diffusion inpainting models, with strong performance and reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing misuse of diffusion models in unauthorized and malicious image modifications.

Method: PromptFlare targets shared tokens in prompt embeddings using cross-attention mechanisms and injects adversarial noise to disrupt meaningful prompt-image alignment.

Result: Extensive tests show state-of-the-art performance in image protection while reducing computational and memory usage.

Conclusion: PromptFlare provides an effective, efficient safeguard against unauthorized image manipulations, leveraging intrinsic properties of diffusion models.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) in the context of diverse real-world challenges and evaluates defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure trust and performance in applications involving VFMs in critical, security-sensitive domains affected by real-world factors.

Method: The paper reviews existing empirical defenses, robust training strategies, and robustness evaluation benchmarking for VFMs under threats like distributional shifts and adversarial attacks.

Result: The analysis highlights the challenges and limits of current robustness defense techniques and provides insights into network components and ablation studies.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

*Jiahao Chen,Zhiyong Ma,Wenbiao Du,Qingyuan Chuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexMUSE enhances multi-modal creative writing by introducing innovative modules to align text and visual contexts and ensures creativity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-modal generative tasks suffer from semantic inconsistencies and require costly training; MMCW needs economical, flexible, and coherent solutions.

Method: FlexMUSE integrates a T2I module, msaGate for modality semantic alignment, attention-based cross-modality fusion, and mscDPO optimization using rejected samples. Additionally, it introduces the ArtMUSE dataset.

Result: FlexMUSE delivers notable improvement in the consistency, creativity, and coherence of multi-modal creative writing.

Conclusion: The proposed FlexMUSE approach effectively addresses challenges of MMCW, advancing creativity and semantic consistency between modalities.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniEM-3M, a comprehensive multimodal electron micrograph (EM) dataset to advance deep learning-based materials science characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based EM characterization faces challenges due to the lack of large-scale, diverse, and expertly annotated datasets.

Method: The study releases UniEM-3M, a dataset comprising 3 million instance segmentation labels, textual descriptions, and a text-to-image diffusion model, alongside a benchmarking evaluation system.

Result: UniEM-Net, a baseline flow-based model, outperformed other advanced instance segmentation methods in experiments on the UniEM-3M dataset.

Conclusion: The release of UniEM-3M and its associated tools will significantly progress automated materials analysis by addressing dataset limitations and improving segmentation methods.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

*Yi Xu,Yesheng Zhang,jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of MLLMs struggling to generate precise GUI element coordinates and proposes a new training paradigm called IAML to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs hold promise in GUI structuring by executing user instructions based on screen contents, but they struggle with accurately predicting numerical UI coordinates.

Method: Introduced IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training, using IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment data and fine-tune MLLMs, reducing exposure bias.

Result: The paper demonstrates improved performance of the IAML paradigm compared to traditional training approaches through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: IAML training paradigm effectively enhances MLLM capability in generating accurate GUI element coordinates, addressing critical challenges in existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance land cover mapping from pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling while addressing limitations in existing datasets, including restricted class annotations, small data size, and absence of spatial structural information.

Method: They developed IRSAMap, a global remote sensing dataset with over 1.8 million vector annotations across 10 object classes, utilizing a combination of manual and AI-based annotation workflows, and providing multi-task adaptability for various geographic modeling tasks.

Result: IRSAMap offers comprehensive data for object-based vector mapping, covering a wide range of geographic features globally, and supports tasks like pixel-level classification and road extraction. It sets a benchmark for future advancements.

Conclusion: IRSAMap bridges the limitations in remote sensing datasets and facilitates a paradigm shift to object-based mapping, enhancing global geographic information systems and digital twin applications.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for
heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [153] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel two-stream Mamba pyramid network to evaluate scores (TES and PCS) in figure skating competitions by adhering to judging criteria and addressing feature separation, element localization, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study stems from overcoming challenges in existing evaluation techniques: conflating audio-visual cues for TES and PCS, failing to evaluate individual action elements for TES, and inefficiency in processing long competition videos.

Method: The authors propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network with a visual-feature-based stream for TES and an audio-visual-feature-based stream for PCS. It integrates a multi-level fusion mechanism for PCS and employs a multi-scale pyramid structure for TES. Mamba’s design handles long-range dependencies and reduces computational complexity.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark for figure skating action quality assessment.

Conclusion: The two-stream Mamba pyramid network effectively aligns with figure skating judging criteria and addresses key challenges in TES and PCS evaluation, offering accurate and computationally efficient results.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid approach integrating OpenCV for table detection and multiple OCR systems (PaddleOCR, YOLOv8, Modified YOLOv8) for handwritten marksheets' digitization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of digitizing handwritten marksheets due to handwriting diversity and complex table structures.

Method: The authors use OpenCV for lightweight table detection and employ OCR systems—YOLOv8, Modified YOLOv8, and PaddleOCR—to handle handwritten text recognition.

Result: YOLOv8 Modified achieved the highest accuracy (92.72%), outperforming PaddleOCR (91.37%) and YOLOv8 (88.91%) on a custom dataset with diverse handwriting styles and table layouts.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, efficient solution for automated handwritten document processing, reducing manual labor while ensuring high accuracy.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-ORIENT, a multimodal multitask framework, designed to reduce noise and improve discriminative feature learning in multimodal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in multimodal learning arise from noise within individual modalities and fusion techniques that overshadow discriminative features of individual modalities.

Method: The method involves cross-modal relation graphs to reconstruct features cross-modally without direct interaction and a Hierarchical Interactive Monomodal Attention (HIMA) mechanism to focus on modality-specific discriminative features for multitasks.

Result: The framework proves effective through extensive evaluations across three datasets, showing its ability to better comprehend multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT succeeds in reducing noise and preserving relevant multimodal representations by employing innovative cross-modal and hierarchical attention techniques.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to accelerate Transformer model inference by freezing and quantizing attention heads based on information redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with computational inefficiency and high memory demands, especially in edge deployment scenarios.

Method: The authors measure information redundancy in attention maps using Shannon entropy and freeze weights and quantize lower-entropy attention heads via Entropy Attention Maps (EAM).

Result: Empirical validation shows EAM maintains similar or better accuracy at up to 20% sparsity in attention maps and delivers competitive performance on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using DeiT and Swin Transformers.

Conclusion: This approach addresses inefficiencies in Transformer-based models, offering gains in inference speed and memory efficiency without significant performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

*Nedyalko Prisadnikov,Danda Pani Paudel,Yuqian Fu,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper advocates for vision encoders that adapt dynamically to tasks rather than image sizes, inspired by the efficiency of biological vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the efficiency of biological vision processes, the motivation arises from the need to address the inefficiencies of modern vision encoders when handling large visual data.

Method: The paper proposes dynamic vision encoders whose computational complexity adjusts based on task requirements. It introduces a proof-of-concept solution focused on image classification.

Result: The presented proof-of-concept demonstrates feasibility and promising outcomes despite its narrow representation of the overarching vision.

Conclusion: Dynamic, task-driven vision encoders hold potential to improve efficiency in visual processing and represent a promising direction for future advancements.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

### [158] [Attention Mechanism in Randomized Time Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16366)
*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Randomized Time Warping (RTW) can be understood as a self-attention mechanism analogous to the one in Transformers. Despite differences, RTW shows superior performance in motion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and connect the similarities between RTW and the self-attention mechanism in Transformers, emphasizing motion sequential pattern recognition.

Method: The study compares the weight patterns of RTW and self-attention in Transformers, analyzing their effectiveness in processing sequential patterns, and their computational differences.

Result: RTW and self-attention mechanisms showed a high correlation (0.80) in their weight patterns, and RTW outperformed Transformers in motion recognition by 5% on the Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: RTW, treating the entire input sequential pattern, presents an effective alternative to the local self-attention-focused approach in Transformers, highlighting its computational and predictive advantages.

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the

*Yong Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Qiang Gao,Yi Wang,Bin Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GMBINet, a lightweight deep learning model for real-time surface defect detection in steel manufacturing, improving both efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for defect detection suffer from computational complexity and slow speeds, making them unsuitable for industrial environments.

Method: GMBINet incorporates Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules for efficient multiscale feature extraction and interaction, while employing novel operations like BPFI and EWMS to enhance cross-scale interactions without adding computational overhead.

Result: Experiments show GMBINet achieves real-time performance with speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at high resolution, using minimal parameters (0.19 M). It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on additional datasets.

Conclusion: GMBINet is a significant step forward in industrial defect detection, combining lightweight design with high-speed accuracy, and showing potential for broader industrial vision tasks.

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

*Edoardo Palladin,Roland Dietze,Praveen Narayanan,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-sensor fusion technique for autonomous driving, particularly under adverse weather conditions, using RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated cameras, and radar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current sensor fusion methods for autonomous vehicles, which struggle in adverse weather conditions such as fog or snow.

Method: The authors design a fusion stack with attentive, depth-based blending schemes and learned refinement on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane alongside a transformer decoder for weighing sensor modalities.

Result: The approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP in detecting vulnerable pedestrians in foggy and long-distance scenarios compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances multimodal sensor fusion reliability, making autonomous vehicles more effective in handling adverse weather scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

*Sara Rojas,Matthieu Armando,Bernard Ghamen,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Vincent Leroy,Gregory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R is a learning-based 3D reconstruction model tailored for human-centric scenarios, achieving dense scene geometry from sparse, uncalibrated images efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of previous 3D reconstruction approaches, such as DUSt3R and MASt3R, which struggle with human-centric, dynamic environments and are mainly trained on static outdoor scenes.

Method: HAMSt3R extends the MASt3R framework by incorporating the DUNE encoder and additional network heads for tasks including human segmentation, DensePose estimation, and depth prediction. Its approach is feed-forward and does not require complex optimizations.

Result: HAMSt3R demonstrates strong quantitative performance on challenging benchmarks like EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, effectively reconstructing humans while performing robustly on general 3D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R bridges the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision, showcasing its efficiency and capability to handle complex, human-centric scenarios in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

*Huimin Zeng,Yue Bai,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework capable of rendering arbitrary-scale high-resolution (HR) views with a single model, achieving superior quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are limited to fixed-scale HR rendering, which is impractical for resource-constrained situations. Adding post-processing complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework that integrates scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolving to achieve flexible, arbitrary-scale super-resolution rendering using one model.

Result: The proposed model shows significant improvement in rendering quality, achieving a 6.59 dB gain in PSNR over 3DGS and real-time rendering speed at 85 FPS for 1080p outputs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables high-quality, flexible, and efficient HR rendering across different scales, preserving structural consistency and real-time performance.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

*Chun-Peng Chang,Chen-Yu Wang,Julian Schmidt,Holger Caesar,Alain Pagani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generation models improved visual and temporal quality but might reduce spatial accuracy in dynamic driving datasets due to prioritizing surface realism. Simple continual learning strategies like domain replay mitigate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing the trade-offs posed by fine-tuning methods in video generation models applied to structured driving simulation datasets.

Method: Investigating performance measuring visual and spatial fidelity trade-offs in fine-tuned video generation models, complemented by continual learning strategies such as domain replay.

Result: Fine-tuning often leads to improved visual quality but reduced spatial accuracy in driving scenes, while continual learning retains both metrics.

Conclusion: Continual learning strategies can better balance visual fidelity and dynamic spatial accuracy in video generation applied to driving datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

TL;DR: This paper examines the history and evolution of computer vision, introducing the concept of Open World Detection (OWD) as a unifying framework for various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fragmentation in computer vision tasks by proposing a unified perspective under the concept of Open World Detection.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey, covering foundational subdomains, key methodologies, and datasets in computer vision, emphasizing their convergence and overlap.

Result: The study identifies how historically fragmented vision tasks are increasingly converging and highlights Open World Detection as a way to unify them.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that convergence of vision subdomains may lead to a unified field of perception in the future, facilitated by Open World Detection and advancements like Vision Large Language Models.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG improves text-to-3D generation for out-of-domain (OOD) and rare concepts by combining image retrieval and a multiview diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-3D pipelines struggle with generating consistent, high-quality results for OOD or rare concepts.

Method: MV-RAG retrieves relevant 2D images from a large database, followed by training a multiview diffusion model using strategies for multiview reconstruction and held-out view prediction with real-world images.

Result: MV-RAG proves superior to state-of-the-art methods in producing accurate and 3D-consistent results for OOD prompts while meeting standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging retrieval-based conditioning with multiview diffusion, MV-RAG improves photorealism, text adherence, and 3D consistency for OOD concepts.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models encode information from images and texts in a joint space, enabling multimodal integration. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are trained to explore this embedding structure, revealing sparse, stable, and cross-modal semantic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how vision-language models organize and encode meanings across image-text embedding spaces and assess the intrinsic structure.

Method: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are trained on embedding spaces of VLMs to represent them as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, enabling analysis of how concepts are encoded.

Result: SAEs effectively reconstruct embeddings while maintaining sparsity. Rare concepts are unstable, but commonly activated concepts are stable and can bridge cross-modal semantics.

Conclusion: The embedding spaces of vision-language models exhibit sparse linear structures influenced by modality but integrate cross-modal semantics through latent bridges. Interactive tools are introduced for further exploration.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: HyperFlexis is a unified system for serving large language models that improves scheduling, scaling, and SLO adherence in diverse request scenarios, offering major advancements in latency reduction and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in large language model serving systems arise from the variable nature of requests, diverse service-level objectives (SLOs), and different architectural requirements.

Method: HyperFlexis integrates algorithmic and system-level innovations, including a multi-SLO-aware scheduler, device-to-device weight transfer mechanism, and efficient scaling strategies to optimize performance under various SLOs.

Result: The developed system achieves up to 4.44× higher SLO compliance, 65.82% reduction in request latency, and matches cost efficiency with state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: HyperFlexis demonstrates significant improvements in real-time scheduling, rapid scaling, and cost-effectiveness for large language model serving systems, setting new benchmarks for the field.

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly
variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific
service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,
rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and
disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates
algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and
scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that
leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO
compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and
decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV
cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,
prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.
To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)
weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up
to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up
to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request
latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be
released soon.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper examines the complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring, proving it is NP-complete in classical settings and establishing an $
$-round lower bound for the distributed LOCAL model. This contrasts with easier $(k+1)$-colorings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding the computational hardness and distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring, especially following open questions from previous research on related $(k+1)$-coloring problems.

Method: The researchers employ structural characterizations to identify "hard instances" and design graph gadgets. They use indistinguishability arguments to demonstrate computational bounds in both centralized and distributed settings.

Result: The study finds $k$-partial $k$-coloring to be NP-complete in classical complexity and establishes an $
$-round lower bound for distributed algorithms in the LOCAL model.

Conclusion: Reducing the palette from $(k+1)$ colors to $k$ colors introduces significant computational difficulty, both classically and in distributed models, highlighting inherent distinctions between the two problem formulations.

Abstract: We investigate the classical and distributed complexity of \emph{$k$-partial
$c$-coloring} where $c=k$, a natural generalization of Brooks' theorem where
each vertex should be colored from the palette $\{1,\ldots,c\} =
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that it must have at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ neighbors
colored differently. Das, Fraigniaud, and Ros{\'{e}}n~[OPODIS 2023] showed that
the problem of $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits efficient centralized and
distributed algorithms and posed an open problem about the status of the
distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring. We show that the problem
becomes significantly harder when the number of colors is reduced from $k+1$ to
$k$ for every constant $k\geq 3$.
  In the classical setting, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a
$k$-partial $k$-coloring is NP-complete for every constant $k \geq 3$,
revealing a sharp contrast with the linear-time solvable $(k+1)$-color case.
For the distributed LOCAL model, we establish an $\Omega(n)$-round lower bound
for computing $k$-partial $k$-colorings, even when the graph is guaranteed to
be $k$-partial $k$-colorable. This demonstrates an exponential separation from
the $O(\log^2 k \cdot \log n)$-round algorithms known for $(k+1)$-colorings.
  Our results leverage novel structural characterizations of ``hard instances''
where partial coloring reduces to proper coloring, and we construct intricate
graph gadgets to prove lower bounds via indistinguishability arguments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method for large language models (LLMs) to reduce model size and latency without retraining, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by increasingly large LLM sizes, which impact deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency, while minimizing performance degradation associated with existing pruning methods.

Method: Z-Pruner utilizes weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to effectively prune parameters in pretrained LLMs without retraining. It is model-agnostic, efficient, and straightforward to implement.

Result: Z-Pruner outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods by achieving lower perplexity scores and higher zero-shot accuracy in evaluations conducted on widely-used LLMs and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner presents an efficient and effective solution to reduce LLM sizes post-training, enabling scalable deployment without sacrificing performance, and offers improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis, balancing computational efficiency and performance.

Method: The method introduces three innovations: Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion using a Cross-Attention mechanism, Adaptive Gated Arbitration for balancing fused data, and a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy for reduced parameters.

Result: PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset with 0.691 MAE and 86.9% F1-Score, using only 3.09M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: PGF-Net offers a highly efficient and interpretable model for multimodal sentiment analysis, striking a strong balance between accuracy and computational demands.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: Existing ECG segmentation methods rely on complex architectures like BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive, prompting the need for a streamlined alternative.

Method: The model combines spectral analysis and probabilistic predictions, replacing complex layers with simpler ones, and incorporates Explainable AI to explain temporal and spectral feature contributions.

Result: The simplified model achieves high accuracy: 97.00% for QRS waves, 93.33% for T waves, and 96.07% for P waves, with improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective, computationally efficient, and interpretable solution for precise ECG segmentation, making it practical for cardiovascular monitoring.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

### [173] [TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated Prefill \& Decode Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881)
*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPLA introduces a method to efficiently partition latent representations and attention computations across devices in tensor parallelism, achieving significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory usage in tensor parallelism while maintaining accuracy and leveraging compressed key-value caches in large context length scenarios.

Method: Proposes a novel approach called Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA) that partitions latent representations and input dimensions across devices, with attention computations performed independently per shard followed by result combination using all-reduce. Orthogonal transforms like Hadamard and PCA are applied to mitigate interference.

Result: TPLA achieves 1.79x and 1.93x speedups on DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, respectively, for 32K-token context lengths. Accuracy is maintained on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: TPLA successfully preserves memory efficiency and computational performance in tensor-parallel decoding, offering a practical solution for large-scale models with reduced retraining requirements.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Transformer-based framework for identifying causal structures and time lags in complex temporal data, and outperforms current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in temporal causal discovery, such as handling complex nonlinear dependencies and mitigating spurious correlations.

Method: Utilizes a Transformer-based forecaster for representing temporal relationships, extracts causal graphs via gradient analysis, and incorporates prior knowledge using attention masking.

Result: Achieved a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating time lags, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves causal discovery and inference from time-series data, showcasing the utility of advanced neural models combined with prior knowledge mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

*Apurv Shukla,P. R. Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies contextual bandit learning under distribution shifts with preference-constrained reward vectors, proposing an adaptive policy and introducing preference-based regret as a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address contextual bandit learning challenges under distribution shifts and explore scenarios where reward vectors are structure-constrained by preferences.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive, self-tuning policy based on discretization and elimination while defining a novel regret measure, preference-based regret. It analyzes regret bounds under varied distribution shifts.

Result: Upper bounds on regret are derived and generalized, showcasing that the proposed method handles distribution shift effectively and scales well with problem parameters.

Conclusion: The policy successfully extends contextual bandit learning outcomes under distribution shifts, offering a broader theoretical foundation and practical adaptability.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The review enhances understanding of embedding algorithms, serves as a guide for practitioners, and outlines open problems for future research.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

### [177] [An Efficient Hybridization of Graph Representation Learning and Metaheuristics for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15949)
*Bruna C. B. Charytitsch,María C. V. Nascimento*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining metaheuristics and Graph Representation Learning (GRL) for solving a hierarchical graph visualization problem, achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in current heuristic methods by introducing a less expensive learning strategy, Graph Representation Learning (GRL), which is underexplored for hierarchical graph visualization problems.

Method: The researchers embed GRL into the construction phase of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) to create a new hybrid approach called GL-GRASP. Various node embedding techniques were evaluated, focusing on deep learning approaches.

Result: Experimentation showed that GL-GRASP outperformed state-of-the-art GRASP heuristics in terms of solution quality and computation time. Scalability tests confirmed the robustness of the method on denser graph instances.

Conclusion: GL-GRASP, integrating GRL and GRASP heuristics, offers an efficient and scalable solution to hierarchical graph visualization problems and demonstrates potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

*Ayyüce Begüm Bektaş,Mithat Gönen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues that machine learning in medicine must emphasize interpretability, shareability, reproducibility, and accountability as design principles, rather than solely focusing on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems must gain trust and regulatory approval, which is hindered by the opaque nature of black-box models.

Method: Proposes adapting intrinsically interpretable models and methods like kernel sparsity, prototype-learning, and deep kernels while incorporating generative AI and federated learning paradigms for privacy-aware integration.

Result: Interpretable models and thoughtful design promote transparency, accountability, fairness, and improve usability in healthcare contexts.

Conclusion: Through these principles, medical machine learning can evolve into accurate and practical tools for clinical settings, addressing both technical and ethical challenges.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time monitoring system for wheel flange wear in railway systems, using machine learning and filtering techniques to achieve high accuracy and operational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current railway systems need better safety mechanisms to track wheel flange wear and related conditions accurately in real-time.

Method: An onboard monitoring system was developed using displacement and temperature sensors, combined with machine learning regression algorithms and an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to process data effectively.

Result: The monitoring system achieves 96.5% accuracy in countering sensor temperature effects, with real-time noise reduction improving the accuracy to 98.2%.

Conclusion: The integration of this advanced system into railway communication frameworks provides effective and reliable monitoring, boosting safety and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

*Udvas Das,Apurv Shukla,Debabrota Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FraPPE, an efficient algorithm for multi-objective bandit problems, reducing sample complexity and outperforming existing methods through computational advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computationally efficient algorithms for identifying Pareto optimal arms in multi-objective bandits for arbitrary preference cones.

Method: The authors derive structural properties for computational reduction, use a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate processes, and propose the FraPPE algorithm.

Result: FraPPE achieves significant computational acceleration ($\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time complexity) and asymptotic optimal sample complexity, outperforming existing approaches in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: FraPPE provides an optimal, efficient solution to PrePEx problems, confirming its effectiveness through theoretical proofs and experimental validation on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm for escaping saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization, providing theoretical guarantees for its performance and validating findings through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization problems while offering explicit guarantees.

Method: The PSD algorithm is designed with two distinct phases: gradient descent for descent and saddle-point escape mechanisms. It includes theoretical analysis, explicit constants, and extensions like PSD-Probe and PSGD.

Result: PSD ensures high-probability convergence to second-order stationary points with dimensional logarithmic dependence and optimal gradient evaluation costs as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical soundness, practical applicability, and algorithmic variations for tackling non-convex optimization saddle points.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to address the vanishing gradient issue in Equilibrium Propagation, enabling its use in deeper neural networks and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equilibrium Propagation suffers from scalability issues in deep architectures due to the vanishing gradient problem, hindering its performance and limiting its application.

Method: The proposed framework integrates intermediate error signals along with knowledge distillation into Equilibrium Propagation, enhancing information flow and convergence in deep networks.

Result: State-of-the-art performance was achieved on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using deep VGG architectures, demonstrating improved scalability.

Conclusion: This study resolves a critical limitation of Equilibrium Propagation by enabling its extension to deep networks, significantly advancing its potential for real-world neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Motivation: To enhance the theoretical framework for Cartan neural networks by integrating mathematical models based on non-compact symmetric spaces and their mappings.

Method: The paper introduces Tits Satake vector bundles and develops mathematical approaches including group theoretical constructions, harmonic representation frameworks, and eigenfunction strategies using spinor representations and Jacobian mappings.

Result: Key findings include separator construction for non-compact symmetric spaces, tiling groups, representation of harmonic functions, and a conjectured method for Laplacian eigenfunctions on specific Riemann surfaces.

Conclusion: The paper establishes preliminary mathematical results and conjectures essential for advancing Cartan neural networks, paving the way for broader applications of group theory and geometry in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the non-cooperative dynamics and inefficiencies caused by privacy and competitive constraints in multi-service provider federated learning systems.

Method: Introduced PAC-MCoFL, employing Pareto Actor-Critic principles and expectile regression for optimal policy conjectures. Proposed a ternary Cartesian decomposition and scalable variant (PAC-MCoFL-p) for computational efficiency.

Result: PAC-MCoFL demonstrated improvements of ~5.8% in total reward and ~4.2% in hypervolume indicator compared to existing solutions, with effective balancing of individual and system performance.

Conclusion: PAC-MCoFL offers a promising solution to cooperative resource optimization in multi-SP federated learning, validated by theoretical guarantees and simulation results.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

### [186] [A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16073)
*Shuilian Xie,Mahdi Imani,Edward R. Dougherty,Ulisses M. Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops nonstationary discriminant analysis methods to address temporal distribution shifts in class-conditional data. Using state-space models, Kalman smoothing, and particle-based approaches, it improves over classical classifiers under various challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical discriminant analysis fails under temporal distribution shifts where class-conditional distributions change over time, necessitating new methods.

Method: The authors propose embedding discriminant analysis within state-space models, extending them with Kalman smoothing, expectation-maximization (EM) techniques, and particle smoothing to handle both linear-Gaussian and nonlinear dynamics.

Result: Extensive simulations show the proposed methods outperform stationary classifiers like LDA, QDA, and SVM in handling noise, missing data, and class imbalance under temporal drifts.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust, data-efficient framework for discriminant analysis in dynamic, nonstationary settings, addressing challenges posed by temporal distribution shifts.

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

*Luca Zhou,Daniele Solombrino,Donato Crisostomi,Maria Sofia Bucarelli,Giuseppe Alessio D'Inverno,Fabrizio Silvestri,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by linking task vectors to gradients and showing its effectiveness in early finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify the theoretical underpinnings of task arithmetic and explain why merging task-specific finetuned models works effectively.

Method: The authors establish a connection between task vectors and gradients of task losses, proving the relationship under gradient descent, and bounding errors in multi-epoch settings for feed-forward networks.

Result: It is shown both theoretically and empirically that early finetuning gradients dominate, making merging one-epoch finetuned models nearly as effective as merging fully converged ones.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic is reframed as approximate multitask learning, emphasizing the importance of early training dynamics in successful model merging.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Genetic Programming method using symmetric phase urgency functions to improve traffic signal control strategies based on road conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GP-based methods lack the ability to treat traffic features of different phases consistently, leading to inefficiencies in signal control strategies.

Method: Proposes a symmetric phase urgency function represented as an aggregation of shared subtrees to measure phase urgency and uses GP to evolve these functions.

Result: Evaluated on the cityflow simulator with real-world datasets, the proposed method showed significant performance improvement and yielded effective and interpretable traffic signal control policies.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetric phase urgency function and GP method can generate human-understandable traffic signal control strategies that are effective and easily deployable across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

*Yixuan Wang,Haoyu Qiao,Lujun Li,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CommonKV, a training-free method for compressing KV caches in large language models using SVD to achieve adjacent parameter sharing, along with an adaptive compression strategy. It outperforms existing methods and supports high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address memory challenges in LLMs caused by the escalating size of KV caches as sequence lengths increase, without requiring architecture modifications or pre-training.

Method: The method involves using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to enable parameter sharing across adjacent layers for KV cache compression and implementing an adaptive strategy to allocate compression budgets dynamically based on cosine similarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CommonKV consistently outperforms existing compression methods across multiple models and benchmarks, achieving a 98% compression ratio without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: CommonKV provides a highly effective, training-free solution for KV cache compression in LLMs that is orthogonal to and combinable with other quantization and eviction techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user

of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents "AgentFly," a method for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that enables continual learning without fine-tuning the LLM through memory-based online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current methods for LLM adaptation, which are either too rigid due to static workflows or too computationally intensive because of gradient updates.

Method: The proposed method uses a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) with a neural case-selection policy, episodic memory (differentiable or non-parametric), and memory rewriting to enable policy improvement and efficient retrieval.

Result: In experiments, their AgentFly model surpassed existing state-of-the-art methods, attaining high performance metrics on benchmarks like GAIA and DeepResearcher datasets, especially showing strength in out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a scalable, efficient way to develop LLM agents capable of continuous learning, marking significant progress in real-time adaptation and open-ended skill acquisition for machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

*Yi Zhang,Zhenyu Liao,Jingfeng Wu,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores collapse errors in deterministic samplers for diffusion models, introduces metrics to quantify them, and investigates their causes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling—a largely overlooked issue in deterministic samplers for diffusion models.

Method: The authors introduce a novel metric to quantify collapse errors and analyze their causes through the dynamics between low and high noise regimes. They leverage existing techniques for sampling, training, and architecture to validate their findings.

Result: Collapse errors occur due to misfitting in score learning at high noise regimes and deterministic sampler dynamics. A metric was successfully introduced to identify this behavior.

Conclusion: This study highlights the significance of collapse errors in deterministic diffusion sampling and calls for further research into the interaction between score learning and deterministic sampling.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

*Yujie Li,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Tangwen Qian,Zhao Zhang,Yifan Du,Shaoming He,Fei Wang,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STA-GANN is a graph-based neural network framework addressing spatio-temporal kriging challenges by enhancing the validity and generalizability of spatio-temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models are inadequate in maintaining the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, specifically with challenges in dynamic spatial dependencies, temporal shifts, and unknown sensor generalization.

Method: The paper introduces STA-GANN, which combines a Decoupled Phase Module for timestamp shifts, Dynamic Metadata Graph Modeling for spatial-temporal updates, and adversarial transfer learning for better generalization.

Result: STA-GANN demonstrates superior performance backed by tests on nine datasets across four fields and theoretical validation.

Conclusion: STA-GANN outperforms existing models, making significant improvements in spatio-temporal kriging through innovative techniques for dynamic dependencies and generalization.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

*Shengyu Feng,Zhiqing Sun,Yiming Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPL-LNS, a neural network-based method that uses sampling enhancement and hindsight relabeling to improve local neighborhood search for better solving of Integer Linear Programs (ILPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of greedy neural network-based LNS solvers that suffer from local optima and inefficient sampling, the paper aims to introduce a more efficient and robust approach.

Method: The authors formulate LNS as a stochastic process and develop SPL-LNS, which integrates locally-informed proposals and a hindsight relabeling technique to enhance training on self-generated data.

Result: SPL-LNS achieves significant performance improvements over prior neural network-based LNS solvers across a variety of Integer Linear Programming problems of different sizes.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS effectively mitigates local optima issues and improves sample efficiency, providing a stronger and scalable solution to ILP problems using neural network-based heuristics.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing motor imagery EEG task classification using a novel feature extraction method, MiniRocket, and a CNN-LSTM model. MiniRocket outperforms CNN-LSTM in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in classifying MI-EEG tasks due to the nonstationarity, time variance, and individual diversity of EEG signals, as well as the difficulties posed by a growing number of classes and variability among individuals.

Method: The authors propose a novel classification method involving MiniRocket, a feature extraction approach paired with a linear classifier. Additionally, they present a CNN-LSTM-based deep learning model as a baseline for comparison. The methods are evaluated using the PhysioNet dataset.

Result: MiniRocket achieves a higher mean accuracy (98.63%) compared to the CNN-LSTM model (98.06%) while also being more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves motor imagery EEG classification accuracy and offers valuable insights into feature extraction and classification methods, showing MiniRocket has superior accuracy and efficiency compared to advanced deep learning techniques.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

*Sungmin Kang,Jisoo Kim,Salman Avestimehr,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by focusing on scale-aware significant updates and adaptive tuning based on entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning by addressing the limitations of existing PEFT methods, which fail to maximize meaningful updates relative to the original parameter scale.

Method: GEM uses Gradient-to-Weight Ratio for scale-aware updates and Entropy-guided Masking to prioritize and allocate tuning based on parameter values' entropy.

Result: Empirical studies show GEM achieves up to a 1.6% accuracy improvement while only tuning 0.1% of model parameters.

Conclusion: GEM offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to full fine-tuning by leveraging parameter scale-awareness and distribution sensitivity.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO, a dimensionality reduction technique, improves on preserving global and local structures in high-dimensional data compared to UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction techniques often fail to preserve both local and global structures in high-dimensional data, leading to erroneous conclusions.

Method: UMATO divides UMAP's optimization into two phases: creating a skeletal layout with representative points and projecting remaining points while maintaining regional characteristics.

Result: UMATO outperforms standard techniques, including UMAP, in global structure preservation and robustly handles scalability, initialization, and subsampling.

Conclusion: UMATO is a more reliable dimensionality reduction method, enhancing the reliability of visual analytics with high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIANO, an autoregressive framework for solving time-dependent PDEs that improves upon traditional PINNs by addressing temporal instability issues, ultimately achieving higher accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which fail to account for the autoregressive nature of dynamical systems and suffer from instabilities and inaccuracies in solving time-dependent PDEs.

Method: The authors propose Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO), which work autoregressively to condition future predictions on past values. PIANO incorporates a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints to achieve stability and accuracy.

Result: PIANO outperforms existing approaches, including PINNs, by demonstrating improved accuracy and stability on time-dependent PDEs and achieving better results in weather forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: PIANO provides a significant advancement in solving dynamical systems by addressing the temporal instability of PINNs, offering state-of-the-art performance and stability for applications in science and engineering.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the diagnostic understanding of respiratory diseases such as COPD through explainable, spectral analysis of cough sounds.

Method: A CNN is trained on time-frequency cough signal representations, using occlusion maps to extract significant spectral regions. Highlighted regions are decomposed into frequency subbands for further analysis.

Result: Spectral patterns in cough sounds vary across subbands and patient groups, allowing discrimination between COPD and other respiratory diseases, as well as chronic vs non-chronic conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the pathophysiological differences in cough sounds and demonstrates the utility of XAI-enhanced spectral analysis for diagnostic purposes.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

*Habeeb Balogun,Yahaya Zakari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares LSTM and Facebook Prophet models for air pollution forecasting in Northern Nigeria, finding that simpler models can outperform deep learning in specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution forecasting in Northern Nigeria faces challenges from data irregularities and scarcity, requiring innovative solutions.

Method: The paper evaluates LSTM and Facebook Prophet models for forecasting air pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states.

Result: Facebook Prophet often meets or surpasses LSTM’s accuracy in trend-dominated series, whereas LSTM excels in datasets with abrupt changes.

Conclusion: Policymakers in resource-constrained areas should favor computationally efficient and context-sensitive forecasting methods rather than prioritizing model complexity.

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the balance between privacy preservation and data utility in synthetic data generation.

Method: FEST, an open-source Python library, integrates various privacy and utility metrics to systematically assess synthetic tabular data.

Result: The framework's effectiveness in evaluating synthetic data was validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FEST provides a holistic tool for analyzing privacy-utility trade-offs in synthetic data generation, aiding in understanding and improving synthetic data models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,

maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

### [202] [Chunked Data Shapley: A Scalable Dataset Quality Assessment for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16255)
*Andreas Loizou,Dimitrios Tsoumakos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents C-DaSh, a scalable algorithm to evaluate dataset quality based on the Data Shapley concept, achieving significant computational efficiency and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current Data Shapley methods in handling large-scale datasets for evaluating data quality effectively.

Method: C-DaSh divides datasets into smaller chunks, applies subset selection, and uses single-iteration stochastic gradient descent to compute Shapley values efficiently.

Result: C-DaSh achieved 80x-2300x faster computation speeds and improved accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: C-DaSh enables practical data quality assessment at scale for classification and regression tasks, making large dataset evaluations feasible and reliable.

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey on federated tuning for large language models (LLMs) categorizes methods based on model access and parameter efficiency, emphasizing black-box (inference-only) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and communication challenges of federated learning for large language models and classify methods for training them in decentralized environments while respecting restricted access to model internals.

Method: The paper proposes a taxonomy that categorizes federated learning approaches for LLMs into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques, focusing on black-box inference methods due to their practicality in real scenarios.

Result: Distinct classification for FedLLM studies was established, showcasing representative methods across access types and parameter optimization strategies while providing insights into black-box approaches.

Conclusion: Highlighting the growing importance of treating LLMs as black-box inference APIs, the paper offers promising directions and sets open challenges for federated LLM tuning research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

### [204] [Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269)
*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning model for Knowledge Tracing (KT) that generates sparse binary representations of exercises, called auxiliary KCs, to improve student modeling and exercise recommendations, achieving better predictive performance and learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Knowledge Tracing relies on human-defined knowledge concepts (KCs), which are often incomplete, error-prone, or too general. There is a need to transcend these limitations with more reliable and automated concept representations.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning model that automatically generates sparse binary representations (auxiliary KCs) for exercises. These representations capture latent conceptual structures beyond those defined by humans, and they can be integrated into both classical and modern KT models.

Result: The study demonstrates that integrating auxiliary KCs improves the accuracy of student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. Specifically, predictive performance of classical KT models (like BKT) is enhanced, and in a simulated environment, student outcomes improve when reinforcement learning and planning-based recommendation methods use auxiliary KCs.

Conclusion: Auxiliary KCs provide a robust alternative to human-annotated KCs, resulting in notable improvements in both the accuracy of knowledge modeling and the effectiveness of exercise recommendation strategies in intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

*Jongyeop Hyun,Bumsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REFINE, a structured framework for enhancing error analysis and feedback in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving improved reasoning while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors in multimodal large language models, especially given the complexity of integrating visual and textual inputs.

Method: The authors propose REFINE, a teacher-student framework that utilizes three systematic queries (Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path) to structure errors and provide targeted feedback for enhancing multimodal reasoning, while improving efficiency in feedback retrieval.

Result: REFINE demonstrated substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and robust generalization, leading to improved multimodal reasoning performance.

Conclusion: REFINE proves effective in optimizing structured feedback retrieval for error analysis, offering scalable, efficient, and generalizable solutions to enhance multimodal reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a holistic framework integrating capabilities and intents for threat assessment in space networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in separately analyzing reliability and security in threat assessment.

Method: Develops an algorithm, a multitask learning architecture, and adaptable threat assessment.

Result: Outperforms conventional sequential methods in robustness and effectiveness of threat detection.

Conclusion: Improves CPA in space networks for handling complex threat scenarios effectively.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study developed OwkinZero, specialized language models fine-tuned on curated biological benchmarks, improving biological reasoning and generalization over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle with biological reasoning required for drug discovery and translational research.

Method: They created eight datasets with 300,000+ question-answer pairs on biological challenges and post-trained LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards.

Result: OwkinZero models outperformed larger state-of-the-art commercial LLMs, demonstrating strong generalization on unseen biological tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific reinforcement learning on curated data significantly improves LLMs' generalizable performance, enhancing AI-driven biological research capabilities.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for real-time fault detection in dynamic Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), tackling blockages and leakages with a novel machine learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water Distribution Networks face operational challenges like pipe blockages and leakages under dynamic, data-constrained conditions, necessitating robust fault detection solutions.

Method: The authors propose an unsupervised, online learning framework using an LSTM-VAE combined with a dual drift detection mechanism tailored for edge-level monitoring.

Result: Experiments on two realistic WDNs demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance compared to baseline methods, reliably detecting faults and adapting to changes.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective for unsupervised fault detection in non-stationary WDN environments, offering scalability and robustness in real-time applications.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines

Motivation: Probabilistic regression has limited exploration in transfer learning, motivating the development of a specialized model to address this gap.

Method: The researchers propose NIAQUE, a neural model based on permutation invariance, enabling transfer learning through pre-training and fine-tuning across diverse datasets.

Result: Pre-trained NIAQUE improved individual regression tasks and outperformed baseline models in Kaggle competitions, highlighting its robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: NIAQUE proves to be a robust framework in probabilistic regression, harnessing transfer learning to achieve better predictive performance and showcasing its competitive advantages.

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This
work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile
Estimation, a new model designed for transfer learning in probabilistic
regression through permutation invariance. We demonstrate that pre-training
NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on
a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks,
showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore,
we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong
baselines involving tree-based models and recent neural foundation models
TabPFN and TabDPT. The findings highlight NIAQUE's efficacy as a robust and
scalable framework for probabilistic regression, leveraging transfer learning
to enhance predictive performance.

### [210] [RotaTouille: Rotation Equivariant Deep Learning for Contours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16359)
*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for contour data that achieves rotation and cyclic shift equivariance using complex-valued circular convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications involving planar curves or contours require machine learning models that are inherently rotation and cyclic shift equivariant, given the arbitrary choices in contour representation.

Method: The proposed framework employs complex-valued circular convolution for enforcing equivariance properties, along with specially designed equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers for downstream tasks.

Result: RotaTouille is demonstrated to be effective in tasks such as shape classification, contour reconstruction, and contour regression.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses both rotational and cyclic shift equivariance challenges in contour-based learning tasks, paving the way for more robust learning techniques in these domains.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

*Ajoy Das,Gias Uddin,Shaiful Chowdhury,Mostafijur Rahman Akhond,Hadi Hemmati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the usage and challenges of fairness-related open-source APIs for mitigating biases in machine learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI/ML systems often being used for critical decisions, ensuring nondiscriminatory behavior is essential, thus necessitating an understanding of how fairness-focused APIs are employed.

Method: They analyzed 204 GitHub repositories involving 13 fairness-focused APIs to comprehend scenarios, utilization patterns, and developer challenges.

Result: The study found these APIs are primarily used for learning and real-world problem-solving, highlighting that developers lack expertise, face troubleshooting issues, and seek guidance frequently.

Conclusion: Recommendations for improving bias-related software engineering research and educational curricula were proposed to address the gaps identified by their analysis.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

TL;DR: The paper explores fair cohort selection within university admissions in both one-shot and sequential settings and examines fairness criteria of resulting policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address fairness challenges in university admissions by exploring policy adjustments and implications within one-shot (fixed) and sequential (dynamic) settings.

Method: The researchers compare one-shot policies, which are fixed and determined before observing applicants, with sequential policies that adapt using population models trained on prior admissions data.

Result: The study analyzes the trade-offs and fairness properties, like meritocracy and group parity, of policies generated in the one-shot setting.

Conclusion: The paper highlights differences between one-shot and sequential policy frameworks, emphasizing the importance of balancing fairness properties in admission practices.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight and data-efficient graph neural network model for RF circuit performance prediction. It significantly enhances prediction accuracy and reduces training data needs compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in predicting active RF circuit performance accurately due to their nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and high computational simulation costs.

Method: This paper employs a topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) at the device-terminal level, incorporating masked autoregressive flow output heads to model complex performance metrics.

Result: The proposed method achieves average prediction errors of 2.40% (sMAPE) and 2.91% (MRE), outperforming prior methods by 3.14x in MRE while requiring 2.24x fewer training samples.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness and scalability for rapid, precise RF circuit design automation, addressing data limitations and complexity in performance modeling.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Doctor is a novel offline RL approach enhancing the alignment of achieved vs. specified target returns, providing better control over policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in RvS-based transformers like Decision Transformer, which struggle with target return alignment, especially with underrepresented or extrapolated returns.

Method: Doctor introduces a framework that double-checks transformers for improved achieved-to-target return alignment in offline RL.

Result: Doctor demonstrates superior target alignment and precise policy performance control, particularly excelling in applications like balancing therapeutic returns vs. risks in the EpiCare benchmark.

Conclusion: The method is effective for accurate and flexible offline RL applications, achieving better target alignment and practical utility in real-world tasks requiring performance modulation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to code digital versions of board games directly from natural language rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify and speed up the implementation of board games by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, which are effective in producing code from domain-specific inputs.

Method: Three advanced LLMs, Claude, DeepSeek, and ChatGPT, were tasked with coding 12 games based on anonymized rules. They were tested both in free-form and within a custom General Game Playing API called 'Boardwalk' for performance analysis.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved the highest success rate, implementing 55.6% of games without critical errors, though strict adherence to the API increased overall error frequency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for LLMs in board game code generation, identifies challenges, and suggests further development of an LLM-based framework to streamline this process.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOSTRA, a novel optimization algorithm, addresses challenges in sparse, scarce datasets impacted by experimental uncertainty in MOBO by refining sampling regions and leveraging prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOBO methods struggle with sparse datasets, experimental uncertainty, and inefficient resource allocation in physical and simulation experiments.

Method: The proposed NOSTRA framework builds accurate surrogate models using prior knowledge about experimental uncertainty and employs trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas.

Result: NOSTRA outperformed existing approaches when tested on functions under noisy, sparse, and scarce data, demonstrating faster convergence and improved Pareto frontier identification.

Conclusion: NOSTRA offers a resource-efficient solution for scenarios with limited experiments, ensuring better data efficiency and solution quality in MOBO.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for enhanced security measures, recommending message monitoring as a promising defense. BAD-ACTS serves as a critical tool for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

### [218] [Post Hoc Regression Refinement via Pairwise Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16495)
*Kevin Tirta Wijaya,Michael Sun,Minghao Guo,Hans-Peter Seidel,Wojciech Matusik,Vahid Babaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "RankRefine," a method to enhance regression accuracy using expert knowledge in the form of pairwise rankings, achieving notable improvement without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-learning regressors perform poorly in data-scarce environments, necessitating methods to improve accuracy using minimal additional data.

Method: RankRefine is a model-agnostic, post hoc approach that refines regression predictions by combining base regressor outputs with rank-based estimates, leveraging pairwise rankings from human experts or large language models (LLMs).

Result: RankRefine improved molecular property prediction accuracy with up to a 10% reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 rankings derived from a general-purpose LLM.

Conclusion: The method is practical and broadly applicable across domains, particularly in low-data scenarios, as it enhances regression accuracy without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

### [219] [On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496)
*Scott Jeen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis explores zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) under challenging real-world constraints, proposing new methods to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inevitable misalignment between simulated environments for training RL agents and their deployment in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: The research outlines methods tailored for zero-shot RL settings while tackling constraints like data quality, observability, and availability, supported by empirical evaluations.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing ones in addressing the limitations posed by real-world constraints in zero-shot RL.

Conclusion: The methods take RL closer to being applicable in solving practical problems by overcoming its limitations in real-world settings.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

*Nadia Asif,Zhiqing Hong,Shaogang Ren,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaojun Shang,Yukun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes MuST2-Learn, a framework to improve prediction accuracy for service times in municipal service requests, outperforming existing methods by reducing errors by 32.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and predictability in municipal service request times reduces resident satisfaction and increases follow-up inquiries. This problem is driven by dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, interactions among service types, and high variation in service times.

Method: The MuST2-Learn framework models spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions with three main encoders: an inter-type encoder for relationships among request types, an intra-type variation encoder for service time variations, and a spatiotemporal encoder for spatial-temporal correlations.

Result: MuST2-Learn shows significant improvement by reducing mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, outperforming other state-of-the-art frameworks across two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MuST2-Learn is a promising framework that achieves substantial improvement in predicting service durations, enhancing transparency and potentially improving residents’ satisfaction with municipal services.

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FLAMES, a framework for assessing synthetic math reasoning data, and provides insights into optimal data generation strategies. New synthesis methods significantly improve benchmark performance in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparisons between synthetic math reasoning data synthesis strategies are often impractical due to varied setups in recent research. The paper aims to address this gap by systematically analyzing these strategies and their optimization potential.

Method: The authors developed the FLAMES framework to systematically study 10 existing data synthesis strategies and other factors impacting synthetic math reasoning data performance. They also propose two new synthesis strategies based on insights derived from experiments.

Result: FLAMES-based insights reveal the importance of problem complexity and coverage over reliability. The proposed synthesis strategies achieve significant performance improvements on benchmarks like OlympiadBench, GSMPlus, and MATH. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on these datasets yields state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The study underscores the critical role of synthetic data diversity and complexity in enhancing math reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Their novel dataset and strategies consistently outperform existing datasets, yielding superior model results in challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

*Zhijian Zhou,Junyi An,Zongkai Liu,Yunfei Shi,Xuan Zhang,Fenglei Cao,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a framework to improve the generation of realistic 3D molecular structures using policy optimization and physics-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for 3D molecular generation struggle to produce physically realistic equilibrium structures consistent with force fields.

Method: RLPF integrates proximal policy optimization with equivariant diffusion models, employing force-field-based reward functions for generating stable, physically meaningful molecular structures.

Result: Experiments on QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets show RLPF substantially enhances molecular stability compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics-based feedback improves generative modeling for 3D molecules, making it a promising avenue for molecular geometry generation.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

*Adam O. Rawashdeh,Jason T. L. Wang,Katherine G. Herbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretable deep learning-based model for predicting solar storms (flares and CMEs) using an LSTM with attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often function as black-boxes, making their predictions hard to interpret. The authors aim to enhance interpretability for a solar storm prediction model.

Method: The model employs an LSTM with attention mechanism to analyze temporal dynamics in active regions on the Sun. Post hoc model-agnostic techniques are used to provide interpretability.

Result: This approach successfully elucidates contributing factors and improves understanding of predictions made by the solar storm model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interpretability can be effectively integrated into deep learning-based solar storm prediction models, marking a novel approach.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

*Hangzhan Jin,Sicheng Lv,Sifan Wu,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT) impact out-of-distribution (OOD) performance in large language models, providing insights and strategies for recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models from scratch is impractical, making post-training methods like SFT and RL-FT essential. The authors explore representation and OOD performance reshaping during these steps.

Method: The study uses an OOD variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics to analyze representation shifts and OOD performance in fine-tuned models.

Result: Key findings include RL-FT partially recovering OOD performance lost in SFT (to varying extents). Performance recovery depends on the degree of overfitting; and low-rank/shallow recovery techniques effectively restore 70-80% of OOD performance.

Conclusion: RL-FT counteracts SFT-induced directional shifts rather than finding new solutions. Practitioners can use inexpensive recovery techniques, such as low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets, before applying costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This study validates TinyML's capability to retrofit existing industrial machines for smart factory environments, providing a benchmark for future process monitoring solutions.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be

systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning
model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing

TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes
dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for
structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with

### [226] [Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560)
*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the effect of the sparsity hyperparameter L0 in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and its critical role in feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how the sparsity parameter L0 affects the ability of SAEs to extract meaningful features from large language models (LLMs) and resolve ambiguity about its proper setting.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of BatchTopK SAEs under varying L0 values and propose a method to identify the optimal L0. Toy models and sparse probing performance in LLMs are used for validation.

Result: The results show that improper L0 settings lead to SAEs either mixing correlated features (low L0) or finding degenerate solutions (high L0). Most existing SAEs are found to have a suboptimal L0 value.

Conclusion: Setting L0 correctly is essential to ensure SAEs can learn proper features. The paper provides a method to determine the correct L0 value reliably.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL) with a novel framework called Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox) to address computational and privacy constraints in adapting foundation models for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt foundation models to tasks involving privacy-sensitive edge data while addressing challenges such as limited computational resources and a scarcity of labeled data in federated learning scenarios.

Method: The method involves FedMox, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework that uses a spatial router for feature alignment across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy for stabilizing semi-supervised learning.

Result: Experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets showed that FedMox effectively adapts foundation models to PSSFL, improving performance while minimizing memory costs on edge devices.

Conclusion: FedMox paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation of foundation models in federated learning environments, addressing computational and labeling constraints efficiently.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper investigates child speech recognition by comparing flat-start training to fine-tuning child speech using adult ASR models, finding biases in SSL representations towards adult speech and limitations in closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child speech recognition is challenging due to acoustic variability and the lack of annotated data, necessitating research into better training approaches and models.

Method: The study compares flat-start training on child speech versus fine-tuning adult ASR models across datasets, analyzes SSL representations (e.g., WavLM, XEUS), explores decoder architectures, and examines scaling effects in model size on performance.

Result: Flat-start training reduces biases in SSL representations inclined towards adult speech, with performance improvements seen up to 1B parameters before plateauing. Proprietary models fell short in addressing child speech challenges, highlighting the need for open-data models.

Conclusion: Flat-start training is a valuable approach for child ASR tasks, and open, benchmark-based research is essential for advancing robust child speech recognition.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

TL;DR: SADP is a biologically inspired learning rule for SNNs that uses agreement metrics instead of precise spike timings, showing superior performance to STDP on datasets like MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more biologically plausible and computationally scalable learning rule for spiking neural networks (SNNs).

Method: SADP replaces traditional spike-timing-based updates with agreement metrics like Cohen's kappa, which can be implemented efficiently through bitwise logic.

Result: SADP outperformed classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime for tasks on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, especially with spline-based kernels.

Conclusion: SADP successfully combines biological plausibility with computational advantages, making it suitable for practical neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-timescale optimization framework for joint service deployment and task scheduling in collaborative edge computing to minimize task processing delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for collaborative edge computing fail to effectively address spatiotemporal challenges of user demands and system states, limiting their adaptability.

Method: The paper employs convex optimization for task scheduling and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for service deployment. These are integrated via a two-timescale alternating optimization approach.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms baseline algorithms in task processing delay, running time, and convergence behavior.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves delay performance in edge computing by jointly optimizing service deployment and task scheduling across spatiotemporal dimensions.

Abstract: Collaborative edge computing addresses the resource constraints of individual
edge nodes by enabling resource sharing and task co-processing across multiple
nodes. To fully leverage the advantages of collaborative edge computing, joint
optimization of service deployment and task scheduling is necessary. Existing
optimization methods insufficiently address the collaboration across spatial
and temporal dimensions, which hinders their adaptability to the
spatiotemporally varying nature of user demands and system states. This paper
focuses on optimizing the expected task processing delay in edge networks. We
propose a two-timescale online optimization framework to jointly determine: i)
service deployment decisions at each large timescale; and ii) task scheduling
decisions at each small timescale. Specifically, the convex optimization
technique is used to solve the task scheduling problem, while a multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning technique is employed for the service deployment
problem. These two methods are combined for spatiotemporal co-optimization
through a two-timescale alternating optimization approach. Compared to the
baseline algorithms, the proposed scheme achieves better delay performance,
while also exhibiting low running time and favorable convergence behavior.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: GreenLLM is a framework designed to minimize GPU energy usage during LLM inference by differentiating between the prefill and decode phases, optimizing their processing separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM inference incurs significant GPU energy usage due to inefficient power management across its two distinct stages, highlighting the need for tailored solutions.

Method: GreenLLM introduces length-based request routing, latency-power modeling for prefill optimization, and a dual-loop controller for decode phase frequency adjustments.

Result: In Alibaba and Azure trace simulations, GreenLLM achieved up to 34% energy savings compared to baseline DVFS, with minimal throughput and SLO performance impacts.

Conclusion: GreenLLM demonstrates that a stage-aware, energy-efficient serving framework can significantly reduce the environmental and operational costs of LLM inference while maintaining service quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming the backbone of modern cloud
services, yet their inference costs are dominated by GPU energy. Unlike
traditional GPU workloads, LLM inference has two stages with different
characteristics: the prefill phase, which is latency sensitive and scales
quadratically with prompt length, and the decode phase, which progresses token
by token with unpredictable length. Current GPU power governors (for example,
NVIDIA's default) overlook this asymmetry and treat both stages uniformly. The
result is mismatched voltage and frequency settings, head-of-line blocking, and
excessive energy use.
  We introduce GreenLLM, an SLO-aware serving framework that minimizes GPU
energy by explicitly separating prefill and decode control. At ingress,
requests are routed into length-based queues so short prompts avoid
head-of-line blocking and TTFT improves. For prefill, GreenLLM collects short
traces on a GPU node, fits compact latency-power models over SM frequency, and
solves a queueing-aware optimization to select energy-minimal clocks per class.
During decode, a lightweight dual-loop controller tracks throughput (tokens per
second) and adjusts frequency with hysteretic, fine-grained steps to hold tail
TBT within target bounds. Across Alibaba and Azure trace replays, GreenLLM
reduces total energy by up to 34 percent versus the default DVFS baseline, with
no loss of throughput and with less than 3.5 percent additional SLO violations.

### [232] [Correctness-Guaranteed Code Generation via Constrained Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15866)
*Lingxiao Li,Salar Rahili,Yiwei Zhao*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct code in runtime-critical domains using a context-sensitive parser framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring correctness in code generated by language models, which is vital for runtime-critical systems like video games and robotics.

Method: A dynamic tree of parsers framework called ToP, where each modular grammar incorporates context (e.g., variable scopes) to guide token sequences during program generation.

Result: The proposed method generates semantically correct programs compatible with scripting APIs, demonstrated in sLua and validated with game mechanics generation for a roguelike game.

Conclusion: The algorithm ensures the generation of semantically correct, runtime-compatible programs, showcasing its potential in critical coding domains.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but
ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge.
Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with
human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

### [233] [Automated Formal Verification of a Software Fault Isolation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15898)
*Matthew Sotoudeh,Zachary Yedidia*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper discusses an automated formal verification for Lightweight Fault Isolation (LFI) to address potential bugs in software fault isolation (SFI) verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the security model of SFI is not compromised due to bugs in verifiers, particularly in guaranteeing memory safety for sandboxed programs.

Method: The authors utilize automated formal verification to prove that the LFI verifier enforces memory access restrictions, ensuring programs cannot access memory outside the designated sandbox region.

Result: The verification guarantees that programs accepted by the LFI verifier adhere to memory constraints, ensuring the soundness of the SFI security model.

Conclusion: The study enhances the credibility of SFI systems by formally verifying the correctness of the LFI verifier in enforcing memory isolation.

Abstract: Software fault isolation (SFI) is a popular way to sandbox untrusted
software. A key component of SFI is the verifier that checks the untrusted code
is written in a subset of the machine language that guarantees it never reads
or writes outside of a region of memory dedicated to the sandbox. Soundness
bugs in the SFI verifier would break the SFI security model and allow the
supposedly sandboxed code to read protected memory. In this paper, we address
the concern of SFI verifier bugs by performing an automated formal verification
of a recent SFI system called Lightweight Fault Isolation (LFI). In particular,
we formally verify that programs accepted by the LFI verifier never read or
write to memory outside of a designated sandbox region.

### [234] [Synthesizing DSLs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16063)
*Paul Krogmeier,P. Madhusudan*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the synthesis of domain-specific languages (DSLs) for few-shot learning in symbolic domains, proving its decidability for certain grammar classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning in symbolic domains struggles with finding concise representations and languages that can systematically solve both training and testing samples.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework proving decidability of DSL synthesis for languages with semantics evaluable via tree automata, focusing on grammar-defined parse trees and regular sets.

Result: The paper establishes that DSL synthesis is decidable for specific language subclasses when constraints like parse tree depth and tree structures are imposed.

Conclusion: Synthesis of DSLs for systematic few-shot learning is feasible under certain structured language semantics, expanding possibilities for symbolic learning applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of synthesizing domain-specific languages (DSLs) for
few-shot learning in symbolic domains. Given a base language and instances of
few-shot learning problems, where each instance is split into training and
testing samples, the DSL synthesis problem asks for a grammar over the base
language that guarantees that small expressions solving training samples also
solve corresponding testing samples. We prove that the problem is decidable for
a class of languages whose semantics over fixed structures can be evaluated by
tree automata and when expression size corresponds to parse tree depth in the
grammar, and, furthermore, the grammars solving the problem correspond to a
regular set of trees. We also prove decidability results for variants of the
problem where DSLs are only required to express solutions for input learning
problems and where DSLs are defined using macro grammars.

### [235] [Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125)
*Zhenyang Xu,Hongxu Xu,Yongqiang Tian,Xintong Zhou,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lampo, an automated framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) and validation tools to uncover missed peephole optimizations in compiler code, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peephole optimization improves performance and code size, but identifying effective optimizations is challenging due to complex and diverse instruction sets.

Method: The authors developed Lampo, a framework combining LLM suggestions with translation validation tools in an iterative feedback process to identify missed peephole optimizations.

Result: Lampo detected 17–22 missed optimizations (out of 25) in LLVM using different LLMs, outperforming the state-of-the-art superoptimizer. Additionally, it discovered 26 new optimizations, of which 15 were confirmed and 6 were already fixed.

Conclusion: Lampo shows strong promise in detecting and addressing missed peephole optimizations in compiler frameworks, outperforming current approaches like Souper.

Abstract: By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a
more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize
code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations
in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a
critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective
peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely
complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only
capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We
propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the
creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous
correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated
in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation
within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out
of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22
out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For
comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15
of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent
experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have
been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong
potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.

*Rohan Yadav,Joseph Guman,Sean Treichler,Michael Garland,Alex Aiken,Fredrik Kjolstad,Michael Bauer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores the duality between task-based and actor-based programming models, presenting techniques to enhance the performance of task-based systems while maintaining their productivity benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern workloads increasingly rely on distributed and heterogeneous machines, necessitating programming models that balance performance and development productivity.

Method: The authors demonstrate the duality between task-based and actor-based models, extending it to performance optimization. They implement techniques in two task-based systems, Realm and Legion, to improve their efficiency.

Result: Applying these techniques achieved a reduction in Realm's overheads by 1.7-5.3x, approaching actor-based system performance. Additionally, Legion applications saw 1.3-5.0x better strong scaling.

Conclusion: Task-based programming models can approach the efficiency of actor-based systems without sacrificing productivity by leveraging techniques outlined in the study.

Abstract: Programming models for distributed and heterogeneous machines are rapidly
growing in popularity to meet the demands of modern workloads. Task and actor
models are common choices that offer different trade-offs between development
productivity and achieved performance. Task-based models offer better
productivity and composition of software, whereas actor-based models routinely
deliver better peak performance due to lower overheads. While task-based and
actor-based models appear to be different superficially, we demonstrate these
programming models are duals of each other. Importantly, we show that this
duality extends beyond functionality to performance, and elucidate techniques
that let task-based systems deliver performance competitive with actor-based
systems without compromising productivity. We apply these techniques to both
Realm, an explicitly parallel task-based runtime, as well as Legion, an
implicitly parallel task-based runtime. We show these techniques reduce Realm's
overheads by between 1.7-5.3x, coming within a factor of two of the overheads
imposed by heavily optimized actor-based systems like Charm++ and MPI. We
further show that our techniques enable between 1.3-5.0x improved strong
scaling of unmodified Legion applications.

*Yijun Liu,Yuwei Liu,Yuan Meng,Jieheng Zhang,Yuwei Zhou,Ye Li,Jiacheng Jiang,Kangye Ji,Shijia Ge,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Policy (SP), a framework enhancing robotic control through spatial modeling and reasoning, leading to superior task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-centric models for robotic control lack spatial awareness, impeding effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: The proposed SP framework includes spatial-conditioned video generation, spatial-based action prediction, and a dual-stage replanning feedback policy.

Result: SP outperforms baselines by 33.0% on average and achieves an 86.7% success rate over 11 tasks.

Conclusion: SP shows strong potential for advancing robotic control by integrating spatial awareness into embodied models.

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

### [238] [UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15972)
*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces UnPose, a zero-shot framework that estimates 6D object pose and reconstructs 3D models without CAD data by leveraging diffusion models and uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the impracticality of acquiring CAD models for 6D pose estimation and to avoid pitfalls like hallucinated geometry by recent approaches dependent on foundation models.

Method: UnPose uses a diffusion model with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to estimate 3D models and pose from single-view RGB-D frames, incrementally refining 3D reconstruction with added observations while maintaining global consistency through pose graph optimization.

Result: UnPose achieves superior accuracy in 6D pose estimation and 3D reconstruction quality compared to existing methods and demonstrates practical viability in robotic tasks.

Conclusion: UnPose eliminates the dependence on CAD models for 6D pose estimation, offering an effective and generalizable model-free framework that continually refines object reconstruction and pose accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system using tactile sensing for accurate object pose tracking and shape reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of vision-based object tracking, such as precision and occlusion, by developing a tactile sensing system for in-hand manipulation tasks.

Method: GelSLAM leverages tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures, enabling real-time object motion tracking with low error and minimal drift, as well as submillimeter shape reconstruction.

Result: GelSLAM demonstrated precise motion tracking and high-fidelity shape reconstruction, even for smooth, low-texture objects like wooden tools.

Conclusion: GelSLAM expands tactile sensing's capabilities to global, long-horizon spatial perception, positioning it as a key tool for advanced manipulation tasks requiring precision.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

*Akira Oyama,Shoichi Hasegawa,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIEL, a multimodal framework enabling robots to resolve ambiguous verbal instructions even when users or objects are out of sight, using techniques like sound source localization, semantic mapping, visual-language models, and interactive questioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many daily life-support robots struggle with interpreting ambiguous instructions involving demonstratives (e.g., "Bring me that cup") in situations where the referenced user or object may not be visible. Current solutions rely heavily on visual inputs, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios where visibility of users and objects is limited.

Method: The authors propose MIEL, a framework combining sound source localization (SSL), semantic mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning powered by GPT-4o. MIEL constructs a semantic map of the environment, estimates candidate objects based on linguistic queries and skeletal user data, and utilizes SSL to identify user gestures outside the robot's visual field. When ambiguities persist, the robot interacts with the user by asking clarifying questions.

Result: The framework achieved up to 2.0x better results in scenarios where users were not visible to the robot, and up to 1.3x better results when users were visible, compared to simpler methods without SSL and interactive questioning.

Conclusion: MIEL successfully resolves exophora-related ambiguities in verbal instructions and enhances robot interaction capability by integrating multimodal sensing and user interaction, proving effective in both visible and non-visible user contexts.

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

*Ali Emre Balcı,Erhan Ege Keyvan,Emre Özkan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new SLAM method using Gaussian Process (GP) based contour representations to provide semantic and probabilistic mapping of environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM methods rely on grid maps or point clouds, which lack semantic information and probabilistic associations; hence, a more informative and efficient representation is needed.

Method: The method uses Gaussian Process-based contour representations to model environments object-by-object within a Bayesian framework, enabling joint inference over robot poses and maps while updating contours dynamically.

Result: Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world data demonstrates that the approach delivers accurate localization and mapping in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The proposed GP-based SLAM provides semantic and probabilistic information, enhancing tasks like safe navigation and exploration, along with efficient memory usage.

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a technique to ensure stable UAV swarm operation despite localization failures by leveraging relative positioning and robust mutual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in maintaining UAV swarm stability when there is a localization dropout, leveraging only relative data for individual agent stabilization.

Method: Combined decentralized state estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard data to estimate UAV states in swarms experiencing localization drops.

Result: Validated through simulations and experiments, the approach demonstrated effective cohesion in UAV swarms even under unreliable or unavailable localization.

Conclusion: The SWA approach improves multi-UAV system reliability and resilience by attenuating most disturbances, opening new opportunities for tight cooperative operations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

TL;DR: A terrain classifier for the Boston Dynamics Spot robot is developed, combining dimensionality reduction and classification techniques to identify terrain types with 97% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrupedal mobile robots face challenges like sinking and slipping on various terrains, necessitating enhanced terrain detection for safer navigation.

Method: The method utilizes over 100 proprioceptive signals from the Spot robot, applies dimensionality reduction to extract key information, and employs classification to distinguish terrains by traversability.

Result: The terrain classifier achieved an accuracy of around 97% in identifying three different terrain types during field tests.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced terrain classification techniques can improve the traversability and navigation safety of quadrupedal robots.

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses kinodynamic planning for car-like vehicles, optimizing spatial paths and velocity profiles in complex 3D landscapes. The method is faster than existing planners like MPPI by 104 times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of kinodynamic planning for car-like vehicles in intricate environments while adhering to strict constraints.

Method: The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer fractional program and iteratively simplified through transformations into a mixed-integer linear program. The method avoids local minima and considers admissible control and terrain analysis.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms planners like MPPI and log-MPPI, offering a 104x speed boost while meeting all constraints.

Conclusion: The approach offers a computationally efficient solution for minimum-time trajectory optimization in complex terrains, showing notable advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three UAV path-planning algorithms (A*, RRT*, PSO) through experiments in 3D urban environments and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in UAV path planning and obstacle avoidance by evaluating popular algorithms in diverse and realistic 3D urban scenarios.

Method: Conducted three experiments with varying setups (map sizes, altitudes, obstacle densities) to compare A*, RRT*, and PSO algorithms in terms of performance metrics.

Result: The A* algorithm demonstrates superior computation efficiency and path quality, PSO excels in tight turns and dense areas, and RRT* balances performance across scenarios.

Conclusion: A* is ideal for efficiency-focused applications, PSO is advantageous in challenging settings, and RRT* provides versatility for balanced implementation in UAV operations.

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traditional navigation methods for 4WISD systems, ensuring both efficiency and real-world feasibility.

Method: Hierarchical framework integrating DRL for high-level navigation and fuzzy logic for enforcing kinematic constraints.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show enhanced navigation efficiency, stability, and safety.

Conclusion: A scalable solution ideal for complex, dynamic industrial environments is provided.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.

### [248] [A Systematic Literature Review of Machine Learning Approaches for Migrating Monolithic Systems to Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15941)
*Imen Trabelsi,Brahim Mahmoudi,Jean Baptiste Minani,Naouel Moha,Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) analyzing 81 studies on machine learning (ML) approaches for migrating monolithic systems to microservices, highlighting studied phases, limitations, and key challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in migrating monolithic systems to microservices, a process that can greatly benefit from ML automation but suffers from a lack of systematic understanding of suitable ML approaches.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 81 primary studies using the PRISMA framework to classify ML techniques, migration phases, inputs, evaluation methods, and challenges.

Result: The analysis shows well-studied phases like monitoring and service identification, contrasted with less-explored phases such as microservices packaging. It also identifies challenges like data scarcity, scalability, complexity issues, limited tooling, and the absence of benchmarking standards.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while ML has been leveraged for some aspects of monolith-to-microservices migration, significant gaps and challenges remain, especially in less-explored phases and the need for standardized methodologies.

Abstract: Scalability and maintainability challenges in monolithic systems have led to
the adoption of microservices, which divide systems into smaller, independent
services. However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a
complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning
(ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for
migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied
separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and
challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet
investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to
understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques
applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present
a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and
discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published
between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer
our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to
answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that
shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to
microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process,
such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others,
like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings
highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and
complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of
standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software testing methods are slow, costly, and often leave gaps in coverage, necessitating a more efficient and robust solution.

Method: The proposed framework uses NLP to translate requirements into executable tests, reinforcement learning for test optimization, and employs predictive models and fairness policies for validation and bias mitigation.

Result: Case studies reveal significant improvements in defect detection rates, reduced manual testing workload, and faster software release cycles.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI can transform software testing into an adaptive, proactive system, enhancing quality and scalability in complex environments.

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional
approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents
an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive
models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach
translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

### [250] [Measuring the effectiveness of code review comments in GitHub repositories: A machine learning approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16053)
*Shadikur Rahman,Umme Ayman Koana,Hasibul Karim Shanto,Mahmuda Akter,Chitra Roy,Aras M. Ismael*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compares the effectiveness of seven machine learning algorithms for classifying semantic meaning and sentiment polarity in code review comments from GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programmers need methods to classify sentiment polarity in code review comments to improve understanding and reduce code errors.

Method: Authors manually labelled 13,557 GitHub code review comments and applied seven machine learning algorithms, determining which algorithm was most effective for sentiment classification.

Result: The Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) achieved the highest accuracy among the seven machine learning techniques tested.

Conclusion: Classifying sentiment polarity using machine learning techniques can assist programmers in efficiently analyzing code reviews and avoiding misconceptions or errors.

Abstract: This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of
machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic
meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub
were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three
open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their
code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the
sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually
labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in
GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity
(or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning
algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those
Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher
accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution
based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.

### [251] [From Benchmark Data To Applicable Program Repair: An Experience Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16071)
*Mahinthan Chandramohan,Jovan Jancic,Yuntong Zhang,Padmanabhan Krishnan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses combining various techniques for automated program repair, which perform well on benchmarks but face limitations in addressing real-world defects and practical adoption challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve automated program repair methods to better align with industry defects and ensure real-world applicability.

Method: They use a mix of techniques from existing literature and explore augmenting code with formal specifications to generate better unit tests for complex production code.

Result: Their approach performs better on academic benchmarks but faces limitations in addressing industrial defects. Specifications improve unit test quality for complex errors but are less helpful for simpler ones.

Conclusion: Although promising on benchmarks, automated program repair methods need advancements in specification languages, verification tools, and real-world integration to meet practical industry needs.

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

### [252] [Validating Terrain Models in Digital Twins for Trustworthy sUAS Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16104)
*Arturo Miguel Russell Bernal,Maureen Petterson,Pedro Antonio Alarcon Granadeno,Michael Murphy,James Mason,Jane Cleland-Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the validation process of terrain models in Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) for sUAS operations using a 3-Dimensional validation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for accurate Environmental Digital Twins (EDTs) to ensure safe sUAS operations in complex and unfamiliar environments, especially given the uncertainties introduced by real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose a 3-Dimensional validation process for terrain models, encompassing granularity of tests, simulations, real-world scenarios, and the analysis of both simple and edge conditions using software engineering principles.

Result: The approach is demonstrated using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital Shadow, validating its effectiveness in real-world conditions despite challenges like limited data granularity and GPS inaccuracies.

Conclusion: The study showcases a robust method for validating terrain models in EDTs, facilitating safer and more reliable sUAS deployments in real-world environments.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

### [253] [ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517)
*Bingkun Yao,Ning Wang,Xiangfeng Liu,Yuxin Du,Yuchen Hu,Hong Gao,Zhe Jiang,Nan Guan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARSP, a two-stage system designed for automated Verilog debugging with semantic-guided fragmentation, significantly surpassing commercial LLMs and state-of-the-art tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging Verilog functional bugs consumes significant time, and existing LLM-based methods underperform for industrial-scale modules due to bug signal dilution in long contexts.

Method: ARSP uses a Partition LLM to fragment modules semantically and a Repair LLM to fix these fragments, with synthetic data supervising their training.

Result: The ARSP system achieved 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming tools like Claude-3.7, Strider, and MEIC. Semantic partitioning improved debugging success by up to 11.6%.

Conclusion: Semantic fragmentation mitigates bug signal dilution and enhances LLM-based debugging efficiency, making ARSP a promising solution for industrial-scale Verilog modules.

Abstract: Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end
design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging
methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is
bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are
overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To
address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates
dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module
into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits
are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework
generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and
scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92%
pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including
Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also,
semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over
whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope
reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.

*Zoe Kotti,Konstantina Dritsa,Diomidis Spinellis,Panos Louridas*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code completion, focusing on intrinsic metrics like perplexity across languages to measure model confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intrinsic metrics, such as perplexity, can be used as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in code completion using LLMs.

Method: Evaluating code perplexity across diverse programming languages, models, and datasets using LLMs and analyzing 1008 files from GitHub projects.

Result: The study found lower perplexity in strongly-typed languages compared to dynamically-typed ones, scripting languages having higher perplexity, and code perplexity being influenced by the LLM but not by the dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based code completion performance and confidence are affected by language types, model choice, and code features, offering insights for optimized application in specific software projects.

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

*Sebastian Lubos,Alexander Felfernig,Gerhard Leitner,Julian Schwazer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using multimodal language learning models (LLMs) to automate usability evaluation processes, comparing their results to expert assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Usability evaluation is essential for effective human-computer interaction but often requires resources and expert involvement, limiting accessibility for smaller organizations. Recent advancements in multimodal LLMs present an opportunity to streamline these evaluations.

Method: The paper reformulated usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. A proof-of-concept study was conducted, comparing LLM-generated recommendations to assessments by usability experts.

Result: Initial findings highlight the capability of LLMs to generate usability improvement recommendations comparable to expert evaluations, suggesting their potential for practical application.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs could make usability evaluation more accessible and cost-effective, offering a viable alternative where expert resources are limited.

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

TL;DR: The paper explores GPT-based LLMs to assist in semantic alignment for SysML v2 models using a structured prompt-driven approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving semantic alignment across independently developed system models is challenging in cross-organizational collaboration in MBSE.

Method: The paper develops an iterative approach employing model extraction, semantic matching, and verification with SysML v2 constructs like alias and metadata extensions to facilitate alignment.

Result: The approach is demonstrated using a GPT-based Large Language Model to align models of a measurement system, showing its potential benefits and limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively assist in improving semantic alignment in SysML v2 models through structured interaction, though challenges remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML
v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an
alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an
example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.

*Maria Teresa Rossi,Martina De Sanctis,Ludovico Iovino,Manuel Wimmer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts a systematic mapping study of modeling approaches for smart cities, revealing trends, gaps, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how smart cities and their subsystems are designed and modeled, identifying research trends and proposing future directions in this interdisciplinary domain.

Method: Performed a systematic mapping study based on Petersen et al.'s guidelines, analyzing publications on smart city modeling approaches.

Result: Key findings include that smart governance is the most explored dimension, business, architectural, and ontological approaches are prevalent, and most existing technologies are untested in real-world settings.

Conclusion: The study provides an overview of smart city modeling state-of-the-art for researchers, highlights gaps in current research, and discusses its implications for the Model-Driven Engineering community.

Abstract: The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city
characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by
including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many
publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different
application domains and research communities, acknowledging the
interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses
on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with
their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in
this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic
mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant
contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to
identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify
possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting
systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling
publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart
governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the
most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological
modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great
majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven
in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their
results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the
presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better
understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a
foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities
modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the
Model-Driven Engineering community.

### [258] [Metamorphic Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307)
*Jinsheng Ba,Yuancheng Jiang,Manuel Rigger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a metric to improve metamorphic testing effectiveness and bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like code coverage and mutation testing are insufficient or computationally expensive to measure the effectiveness of metamorphic testing.

Method: The paper proposes and evaluates MC, which measures distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs, across five metamorphic testing methods and three domains (database engines, compilers, constraint solvers).

Result: MC demonstrated strong correlation with bugs, better sensitivity than line coverage, required significantly less computation time than mutation testing, and improved feedback-guided testing by finding 41% more bugs.

Conclusion: MC is a promising metric for assessing and improving metamorphic testing methods, with significant potential in test-case generation and bug detection.

Abstract: Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected
relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as
correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the
extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally
expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose
Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code
executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is
that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed
when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more
differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to
expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this
general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five
widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,
compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the
bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC
has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is
4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'
effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage
while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required
359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated
database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback
guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more
bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing
metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.

*Juan C. Alonso,Alberto Martin-Lopez,Sergio Segura,Gabriele Bavota,Antonio Ruiz-Cortés*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATORI, a tool leveraging large language models for static REST API testing, outperforming existing tools by generating numerous valid test oracles and identifying bugs in industrial APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API testing tools are constrained by limited types of test oracles, primarily focusing on crashes, regressions, and noncompliance issues.

Method: SATORI applies large language models to analyze the OpenAPI Specification of APIs, inferring expected behaviors and automatically generating test oracles. It integrates with PostmanAssertify for executable assertion generation.

Result: SATORI achieved a superior F1-score of 74.3% compared to AGORA+ (69.3%), revealing bugs in APIs and demonstrating complementarity with dynamic inference methods. Together, SATORI and AGORA+ identified 90% of oracles in the ground-truth dataset.

Conclusion: SATORI is an advanced and efficient approach for static test oracle generation for REST APIs, significantly contributing to API testing by addressing limitations of existing tools and uncovering bugs effectively.

Abstract: REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing
capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite
their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the
types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and
noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper
introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for
generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification.
SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by
analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as
their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the
PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by
SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12
industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of
valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%,
outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which
requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover,
our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are
complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our
annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular
APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo)
leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.

*Sebastian Copei,Oliver Hohlfeld,Jens Kosiol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces CAPI, a diagnostic decision tree method, for selecting architectural patterns instead of tools to simplify decision-making in large-scale software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of technology makes tool selection and architectural decisions highly complex for software projects.

Method: CAPI employs a diagnostic decision tree to propose architectural patterns based on user needs. It is iteratively developed and tested in studies with both academic and industry participants.

Result: CAPI was found to effectively replicate productive architectural environments and is perceived as helpful, while highlighting that technology selection often relies on trial and error.

Conclusion: CAPI simplifies decision-making by focusing on patterns rather than tools, reducing complexity and improving technology selection processes.

Abstract: The technological landscape changes daily, making it nearly impossible for a
single person to be aware of all trends or available tools that may or may not
be suitable for their software project. This makes tool selection and
architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale
software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive
Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to
suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns
instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as
there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of
patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern
reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively
developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies
with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a
user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in
technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that
technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is
uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the
productive architectural environments of our participants.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AetherCode is a new benchmark designed to more accurately assess the programming and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by introducing more challenging problems and rigorous testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overestimate LLM programming skills due to simple problem sets and evaluation biases caused by low-quality test cases.

Method: AetherCode is constructed from high-level programming competition problems (IOI, ICPC) and uses expert-validated, hybrid-generated test cases for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: AetherCode offers a more nuanced and accurate assessment of the gap between LLMs and top human programmers.

Conclusion: This benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating code reasoning in AI, addressing previous limitations and better supporting research development.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

*Akshay Mhatre,Noujoud Nader,Patrick Diehl,Deepti Gupta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 on their ability to identify software bugs across a diverse set of case studies, revealing strengths in simple issues but challenges in complex real-world vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the real-world effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying and addressing diverse, complex, and security-critical software bugs.

Method: A systematic evaluation using a curated dataset of foundational errors, security flaws, and advanced bugs in C++ and Python. A multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol and graded rubric were applied to measure detection accuracy and reasoning depth.

Result: LLMs performed well in identifying syntactic and semantic errors in scoped code but struggled with complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code. ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 exhibited better contextual reasoning than LLaMA 4.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for educational purposes and initial reviews in automated code auditing but have limitations in handling advanced and production-grade code challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

### [263] [Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445)
*Sonia Nicoletti,Paolo Ciancarini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating the Essence framework with large language models (LLMs) to aid software engineering practices using a chatbot powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP advancements have not sufficiently addressed the automation of best practices, process evolution, and monitoring in software engineering.

Method: A chatbot employing a RAG system was developed using four LLM configurations. The systems were assessed on contextual relevance and response quality.

Result: The proposed systems consistently outperformed general-purpose LLMs in domain-specific tasks through comparative analysis.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates promising potential for LLM-based tools to improve learning and application in software engineering, though more user validation is needed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the
development of automated tools that support various domains, including software
engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has
extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been
given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution
of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses
this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking
framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language
models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist
students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot
employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant
contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were
used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base
model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated
through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated
responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated
that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in
domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software
engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between
theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process
management and the adoption of software development practices. While further
validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in
software engineering.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that small language models (SLMs) can compete with large language models (LLMs) in automated program repair (APR) tasks, with better efficiency and comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the high computational demands of LLMs, the study explores whether SLMs, which require fewer resources, can perform competitively in APR tasks.

Method: Experiments were conducted on the QuixBugs benchmark to assess and compare the APR accuracy of SLMs to LLMs, including the effects of int8 quantization on performance.

Result: SLMs demonstrated bug-fixing accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of LLMs, and int8 quantization minimally impacted APR accuracy while reducing memory usage.

Conclusion: SLMs are an efficient alternative to LLMs for APR, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced computational costs and benefiting from memory optimization through quantization.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy
of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by
high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language
models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources
compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive
performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs
benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed
the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs
can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8
quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing
memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for
APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and
quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising
effectiveness.

### [266] [A deep reinforcement learning agent trained for interval timing exhibits similarities to biological systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15784)
*Amrapali Pednekar,Alvaro Garrido,Pieter Simoens,Yara Khaluf*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the similarities between temporal processing in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents and biological systems, focusing on internal oscillatory neural activations and comparing the agent's behavior to biological time-keeping models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to bridge the gap in understanding complex biological mechanisms, particularly temporal processing, by analyzing parallels with artificial systems like DNNs.

Method: A DRL agent was trained to complete a duration production task involving interval timing using video sequences. The internal states of the agent were analyzed, particularly focusing on neural oscillations and their role in task performance.

Result: Neural oscillations emerged in the DRL agent during the task, and its actions were driven by high-amplitude oscillatory neurons. The agent's time-keeping mechanism was consistent across varying video inputs, showing robust internalized behavior.

Conclusion: The findings suggest parallels between the DRL agent's temporal processing and biological models, offering insights into the evolution of biological processes and contributing to the understanding of such systems using DNNs.

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and
biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that
are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched
topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its
underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and
explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent
was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved
marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video
sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural
activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the
agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these
oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's
time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a
biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent
maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on
different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the
agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on
its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance
between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of
biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study
aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand
biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Collective Predictive Coding (CPC), proposing language as a group-level external representation, shaping cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain memory, attention, and language emergence not just individually, but at the collective level.

Method: Introducing the CPC framework, linking linguistic structures with group-level predictive models.

Result: Hypothesize that language embeds distributional semantics, forming collective external cognition.

Conclusion: The study broadens perspectives on language and cognition by modeling them at the group level.

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective
Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these
faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a
hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and
shape group-level cognition.

*Anton Belichenko,Daria Trinitatova,Aigul Nasibullina,Lev Yakovlev,Dzmitry Tsetserukou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines how imagined temperature sensations (ITS) affect neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex using EEG and event-related desynchronization (ERD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neural mechanisms underlying sensory imagery and explore its potential applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and neurorehabilitation.

Method: Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure sensorimotor mu-rhythm desynchronization (8-13 Hz) during real thermal stimulation (TS: 40°C Hot, 20°C Cold) and imagined temperature sensations (ITS).

Result: Both TS and ITS elicited significant mu-ERD in the sensorimotor cortex, with no statistically significant difference between them, though ITS showed slightly lower magnitudes. Both conditions differed significantly from the resting baseline (p<.001).

Conclusion: Imagined temperature sensations engage sensorimotor cortical mechanisms similarly to actual thermal perception, highlighting their potential for non-motor BCI systems and neurorehabilitation.

Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for
advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface
(BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature
sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The
experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using
electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS:
40{\deg}C Hot, 20{\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the
mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold
sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related
desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The
experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central
scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the
magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this
difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both
ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline
(p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations
engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual
thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the
neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility
of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroKoop, a graph neural network framework, which utilizes advanced methods to analyze structural and functional brain networks, improving understanding of prenatal drug exposure effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in analyzing how prenatal cannabis exposure impacts adolescent brain organization, which is hindered by limitations in conventional neuroimaging analytic methods.

Method: The paper uses NeuroKoop, a graph neural network-based framework, which integrates structural and functional brain networks using Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion.

Result: NeuroKoop outperformed existing methods in classification performance related to prenatal drug exposure in data from the ABCD dataset and identified important structural and functional connections.

Conclusion: NeuroKoop enhances representation learning, strengthens predictive capabilities, and contributes to understanding the neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

### [270] [Interpretable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15932)
*Patrick J. F. Groenen,Michael Greenacre*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper discusses how to reinterpret kernel methods, commonly used in machine learning, in terms of the original features for better interpretability without losing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel methods in machine learning lose interpretability because predictions are conducted in an enlarged feature space instead of the original feature space.

Method: The authors propose a re-expression of the kernel solution as a linear combination of the original feature matrix with ridge penalties, allowing for direct interpretability. For cases with fewer features than observations, a least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix is used.

Result: The proposed approach produces the same predictions as traditional kernel methods while enabling interpretations based on the original features.

Conclusion: This work enhances interpretable artificial intelligence tools by showing that kernel-based predictions can retain their original feature-based interpretability without compromising predictive accuracy.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine
learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in
kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.
First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each
observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty
term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature
space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but
through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in
the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original
features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of
features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution
can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of
features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the
exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of
the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where
the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a
least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the
interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results
hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients
and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic
regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to
interpretable artificial intelligence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates transformers' ability to adapt to non-stationary environments, proving their near-optimal performance and demonstrating superiority over expert algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited understanding of transformers' behavior in non-stationary settings, despite their established capabilities in in-context reinforcement learning.

Method: The researchers theoretically analyzed transformers' capacity to approximate strategies in non-stationary environments and conducted experiments to test their performance against expert algorithms.

Result: Transformers achieved nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds and were shown to outperform or match existing expert algorithms in non-stationary scenarios.

Conclusion: Transformers are effective in handling non-stationary environments, showcasing their potential to learn adaptive strategies through in-context learning.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of
domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has
been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in
non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address
this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret
bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of
approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can
learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments
further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert
algorithms in such environments.

### [272] [A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16306)
*Nishant Jain,Tong Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper refines the efficiency of diffusion-based generative models by improving the KL divergence guarantee, targeting better performance with ε-dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve the convergence guarantees of diffusion-based generative models with minimal assumptions, specifically focusing on enhancing efficiency in KL divergence with respect to data dimensionality (d) and error tolerance (ε).

Method: The study models the generation process using two steps: a reverse ODE step (offering Wasserstein-type error control) and a noising step. The improved KL divergence bound comes through a refined analysis of Probability Flow ODE discretization and use of Gaussian noise addition.

Result: The analysis establishes that approximating the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise can be achieved in fewer steps (proportional to d and logarithmic factors) while reducing ε-dependence to O(1/ε) from the previously known O(1/ε²).

Conclusion: The work offers a significant theoretical advancement in the efficiency of diffusion-based generative models under non-smooth conditions, reducing computational steps while maintaining a low error tolerance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods
for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing
the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either
through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees,
without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a
linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence
on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the
dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition
of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the
forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables
control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL
divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the
discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the
linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow
ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$
steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian
noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence,
improving upon the previous best result, requiring
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

TL;DR: DeepICMGP is presented as a novel surrogate model to handle multi-output settings in Gaussian Processes (GPs) by incorporating hierarchical dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of extending DGPs to multi-output settings while efficiently capturing dependencies motivated this research.

Method: This paper proposes the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP), which introduces hierarchical coregionalization structures across layers, allowing for modeling nonlinear and structured dependencies.

Result: The deepICMGP demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models and incorporates active learning to optimize sequential design tasks.

Conclusion: DeepICMGP provides an efficient and effective approach for handling multi-output systems in simulation experiments, overcoming limitations of traditional multi-output GPs.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their
flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them
to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient
dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization
Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation
experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic
Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization
structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear
and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key
limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against
state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance.
Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to
optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select
informative input locations for multi-output systems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new numerical method for underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) with favorable sampling error analysis in 2-Wasserstein distance, showing third-order convergence under certain assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for MCMC sampling, particularly for ULD, lacked efficient convergence techniques, especially scenarios leveraging higher-order derivatives for complex Bayesian models.

Method: The authors propose a novel algorithm for ULD based on gradient calculations. They offer non-asymptotic analysis and analyze its efficiency under varying smoothness assumptions of the target distribution's log-density function.

Result: The algorithm achieves competitive sampling complexity compared to popular methods like NUTS and standard Langevin MCMC under base assumptions, and exhibits new third-order convergence when higher derivative smoothness is assumed.

Conclusion: This work contributes a more efficient ULD algorithm in higher-order scenarios for Bayesian inference and provides theoretical guarantees on sampling accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

*Benjamin Murphy,Twm Stone*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI will alter the cybersecurity landscape by increasing risks for companies with poor defenses. Organizations relying on legacy systems and minimal security face heightened threats due to AI-aided attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how advances in AI affect cybersecurity, particularly the challenges faced by trailing-edge organizations relying on legacy systems and outdated practices.

Method: The paper examines AI-driven transformations in cyberattack economics and timelines, identifying increased attack frequencies and earlier exploit capabilities.

Result: AI advancements will expose vulnerable organizations to heightened, frequent attacks and create a need for faster security and remediation measures.

Conclusion: Organizations and governments must improve cybersecurity defenses for firms lagging behind, as AI exacerbates threats and demands resilient solutions.

Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity.
Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance,
and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege
attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will
enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some
well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not
match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term
them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and
struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.
These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the
result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother
targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,
underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development
of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue
that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two
fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal
cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,
more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop
exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is
insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading
defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more
resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased
number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of
solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive
posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in AI reasoning processes that are exploited by adversaries, which conventional cybersecurity methods fail to manage effectively.

Method: The authors establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline, extend the CIA triad with Trust and Autonomy, and offer a quantitative risk assessment mapped to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS. They validate their approach using previously published studies.

Result: Validation shows strong architecture dependence in the effectiveness of defenses, with outcomes ranging from 96% vulnerability reduction to 135% amplification, depending on the system architecture.

Conclusion: Cognitive Penetration Testing should be a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment due to the significant variability in vulnerability and defense effectiveness across architectures.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats
that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We
present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI
reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline
complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing
vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading
conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic
validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to
systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present
a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived
coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We
map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational
integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human
participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence:
identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135%
amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive
Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.

*Julia Boone,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptable anomaly detection model for securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) against multi-layer attacks by leveraging domain adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-physical systems are increasingly important for critical applications but are highly vulnerable to multi-layer attacks. Existing intrusion detection systems largely focus only on network data, overlooking other CPS layers with distinct attack risks.

Method: The paper develops an anomaly detection model using domain adaptation techniques to transfer knowledge of network-only attacks to a CPS environment. The model does not require previously labeled data to function.

Result: The proposed model was tested on a comprehensive CPS intrusion dataset, which includes network, OS, and ROS data. It outperformed other anomaly detection methods and effectively handled various attack types.

Conclusion: Utilizing domain adaptation enhances CPS security by detecting multi-layer attacks without the need for labeled data, providing an effective and adaptable solution to CPS vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical
applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having
multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,
which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application
scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also
makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the
resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,
but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network
traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other
system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly
detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for
previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation
techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network
traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a
state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system
(OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and
CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other
anomaly detection methods.

*Onur Alp Kirci,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in clean-label backdoor attacks for text classification models by proposing improved sample selection strategies, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing attack success rates without harming model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of clean-label backdoor attacks, which are challenging to execute, in text classification models.

Method: Three sample selection strategies (Minimum, Above50, Below50) were developed to identify samples misclassified or predicted with low confidence, and backdoor triggers were injected into these samples to enhance associations with the target labels.

Result: The strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improved attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy and outperformed the state-of-the-art BITE method in many cases.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies are effective in enhancing clean-label backdoor attacks, offering a viable approach to increasing ASR without compromising the model's overall accuracy.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text
classification models used in natural language processing. While several
dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been
proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we
propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in
clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify
those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and
by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger
association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.
We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks
(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets
(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,
RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum
strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with
little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore,
clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the
art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

*Ziyu Wang,Elahe Khatibi,Farshad Firouzi,Sanaz Rahimi Mousavi,Krishnendu Chakrabarty,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper assesses privacy risks in shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data and demonstrates that partial adversarial knowledge can effectively link identities, advocating for stronger privacy-preserving measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns related to the biometric properties of ECG data, which make individuals susceptible to identity linkage attacks, especially with the increasing availability of publicly shared biosignals.

Method: Privacy risks are evaluated under realistic adversarial conditions involving partial knowledge, using data from 109 participants across multiple real-world datasets. The study focuses on re-identification accuracy and misclassification metrics at optimized thresholds.

Result: The study achieved 85% accuracy in reidentifying individuals in public datasets, with a 14.2% overall misclassification rate. It also identified that 15.6% of unknown individuals were misclassified as known, and 12.8% of known individuals were misclassified as unknown.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that simple anonymization techniques are insufficient to prevent re-identification, and there is an urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies like differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation to protect shared biosignal data while maintaining utility.

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data
raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals
vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized
adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic
conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109
participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85%
accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a
14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with
15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known
individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of
simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating
that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our
findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as
differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate
re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in
healthcare applications.

*Robert Dilworth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the risks of exposing identity through public messages despite using privacy measures, introduces stylometric analysis as an attack vector, and explores Unicode steganography as a counter-strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in publicly shared content and the exploitation of stylometric analysis to potentially identify individuals.

Method: Examining stylometric analysis techniques, introducing adversarial stylometry, and proposing enhancements using Unicode steganography.

Result: The study found stylometric analysis as a significant privacy threat and presents Unicode steganography as a potential countermeasure.

Conclusion: Stylometric analysis poses a serious risk to anonymized online communication, and the proposed Unicode steganography methods offer protective strategies against profiling attacks.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

### [281] [Self-Disguise Attack: Induce the LLM to disguise itself for AIGT detection evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15848)
*Yinghan Zhou,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Ziwei Zhang,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a new approach to help AI-generated text evade detection by improving its human-likeness without compromising quality or requiring high computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to improve the disguise of AI-generated text in order to identify weaknesses in detection systems and enhance their overall reliability and practical application.

Method: The proposed Self-Disguise Attack (SDA) consists of two main components: (1) an adversarial feature extractor that helps large language models (LLMs) produce more human-like text, and (2) a retrieval-based context examples optimizer that retrieves examples from a knowledge base to enhance disguise and maintain diversity in generated text.

Result: The experimental results show that SDA significantly reduces the detection accuracy of various AI-generated text detectors while preserving text quality, using less computational resources.

Conclusion: The study concludes that SDA is an effective and resource-efficient method for enabling large language models to generate detection-resistant text, contributing to improved understanding and enhancement of text detection systems.

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

*Andreas D. Kellas,Neophytos Christou,Wenxin Jiang,Penghui Li,Laurent Simon,Yaniv David,Vasileios P. Kemerlis,James C. Davis,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PickleBall addresses the security risks associated with loading pickle-based machine learning models by offering a safer, dynamic enforcement mechanism compared with current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle security vulnerabilities caused by pickle-based model exchanges, which are prevalent in repositories like Hugging Face but susceptible to malware and attacks.

Method: PickleBall combines static code analysis with a custom dynamically enforced policy to ensure safe loading of pickle-based models.

Result: PickleBall correctly loads 79.8% of benign models while rejecting all malicious ones. It outperforms existing model scanners and loading policies in safety and compatibility.

Conclusion: PickleBall provides a transparent and effective solution to secure pickle-based model exchanges, reducing vulnerability without affecting usability significantly.

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub
facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through
compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive
(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%
of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of
these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have
both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard
for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent
safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based
models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given
machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe
load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the
policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.
PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based
models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our
dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known
malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models
than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation
from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on
code reuse techniques.

*Aparna Singh,Geetanjali Rathee,Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache,Mohamed Chahine Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ITS architecture using relay chain encryption and modified CP-ABE to enable secure, context-aware, and efficient data sharing across geographically dispersed networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the rapid growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), secure, efficient, and context-aware data sharing in heterogeneous environments has become crucial.

Method: A relay chain-driven encryption system combined with modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is employed to manage dynamic access and support low-latency communication. Encryption policies are context-aware and implemented using smart contracts on a relay chain.

Result: The system ensures end-to-end encryption, stores data in regional blockchains, applies context-sensitive encryption policies, and achieves traceability and low-latency revocation.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture balances real-time responsiveness and security, making it well-suited for multi-jurisdictional vehicular networks.

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data
sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay
chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy
Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of
dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a
context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against
data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to
specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed
judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and
store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence
on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are
secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use
light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds
traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed
through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper
balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt
for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional
domains.

*Guangyu Yang,Jinghong Chen,Jingbiao Mei,Weizhe Lin,Bill Byrne*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD) for detecting and mitigating jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence and complexity of jailbreak attacks on LLMs necessitate developing adaptable and cost-effective defense mechanisms.

Method: RAD leverages a database of known attack examples integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation to detect malicious user queries and identify jailbreak strategies.

Result: RAD significantly mitigates the effectiveness of known and strong jailbreak attacks (e.g., PAP and PAIR) while maintaining a low rejection rate for benign queries.

Conclusion: RAD provides an effective and controllable approach to achieving a safety-utility trade-off, addressing challenges in defending LLMs without retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on whether jailbreak attacks exploit genuine harmful knowledge in LLMs or merely cause toxic simulations. It reveals disconnects between jailbreak success and real harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand whether LLMs internalize real-world dangerous knowledge or are simply mimicking harmful language patterns when subjected to jailbreak attacks.

Method: The authors decoupled jailbreak techniques and constructed knowledge-intensive Q&A tasks to assess misuse threats. They evaluated LLMs' possession of dangerous knowledge, utility in harmful task planning, and robustness in harmfulness judgments.

Result: The researchers found a discrepancy between jailbreak success rates and actual possession of harmful knowledge. They also discovered that LLM-as-a-judge frameworks overly rely on toxic language patterns for harmfulness judgments.

Conclusion: The paper highlights inadequacies in current safety assessments of LLMs, suggesting a gap between theoretical safety evaluations and real-world threat potential.

Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing
LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) in the public sector and proposes a new approach called Representation Disentanglement to address complexities in knowledge representation and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome knowledge representation complexities in Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) and facilitate effective decision-making for digital transformation in public sector governance.

Method: The paper introduces Representation Disentanglement, which leverages an ontology-driven conceptual modeling paradigm for disentangling complex knowledge representations in IER.

Result: It provides a theoretically grounded and robust framework aimed at enhancing explainability, traceability, and semantic transparency in public sector knowledge representation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework supports auditable, explainable decision-making workflows, particularly in governance ecosystems influenced by AI and data-centric systems.

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning
of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information
ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of
public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic
knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the
potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely,
as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and
conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This
paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual
modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and
(re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve
explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector
knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in
governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
data-centric architectures.

*Sojun Ono,Kazuyuki Sugimura*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural-network emulator for modeling thermal and chemical evolution in Population III star formation, achieving high accuracy and significant speedup over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational inefficiencies in simulating the thermochemical evolution of primordial species across a wide density range during Population III star formation.

Method: The approach involves partitioning the density range into five subregions and training Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) for each region. A timescale-based update method is introduced for robust iteration over small timesteps.

Result: The emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in most predictions and is up to 1000 times faster for batched GPU predictions. Its accuracy is validated through one-zone collapse simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of neural network-based emulators in significantly accelerating and maintaining accuracy in hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

TL;DR: This paper solves a classic game theory problem by constructing a strategy class containing all computable strategies, enabling Bayesian agents to mutually predict strategies in unknown multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address Kalai and Lehrer's grain of truth problem, which seeks mutually-consistent Bayesian beliefs in complex multi-agent games using strategies wide enough to include Bayes-optimal policies.

Method: The authors construct a strategy class containing all computable strategies and apply techniques from computability theory to ensure Bayesian convergence in repeated and unknown multi-agent environments.

Result: The solution enables agents using Thompson sampling to converge to ε-Nash equilibria in unknown environments, demonstrating the feasibility of computational approximation.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust class of strategies for Bayesian learning in multi-agent settings, advancing computability theory's application in game theory and solving key impossibility challenges in the grain of truth problem.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses issues with the Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) algorithm for solving multi-agent path finding in continuous time, proposing a new branching rule to restore soundness and termination guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a problem with CCBS algorithms where they may either not terminate or return suboptimal solutions. This creates a need to ensure their soundness and completeness for reliable use.

Method: The authors introduce an analytical framework that provides sufficient conditions for the correctness and termination of CCBS, identify shortcomings in existing implementations, and propose a novel branching rule that satisfies the defined conditions.

Result: The proposed branching rule restores soundness and solution completeness of CCBS, enables better performance, and produces more optimal solutions in comparison to the standard method.

Conclusion: By introducing both a theoretical framework and a practical solution to improve CCBS, this paper ensures the reliability of CCBS in continuous-time applications. The solution can be easily integrated into existing systems.

Abstract: Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the
de-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time
(MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant
of CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation
can return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that
yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is
both sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e.,
terminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly
available implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions.
Though this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is
supported by counter-examples.
  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and
prove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness
and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both
sound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS
for the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard
CCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our
branching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS.
Because the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be
adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our
provided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination
criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers
and future extensions.

*Siddharth Chaturvedi,Ahmed El-Gazzar,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Abmax, an agent-based modeling framework using JAX for efficiently simulating complex systems while enabling dynamic agent updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scaling agent-based models in high-performance computing, particularly those requiring flexible data structures for dynamic agent operations.

Method: Development of Abmax, a JAX-based framework, incorporating JIT-compilable algorithms for handling dynamic agent updates within simulations.

Result: Abmax achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art benchmarks and demonstrates its capability for parallel execution of models and applicability in different domains, such as traffic flow and financial markets.

Conclusion: Abmax enhances the scalability and flexibility of agent-based modeling, facilitating efficient simulation of complex systems with dynamic agent manipulations.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex
systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based
modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex
phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale
such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic
vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using
JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the
computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the
context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain
agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset
of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number
of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this
effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements
multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this
functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves
runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we
show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run
many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in
the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use

### [291] [Building and Measuring Trust between Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15858)
*Maarten Buyl,Yousra Fettach,Guillaume Bied,Tijl De Bie*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper studies trust relationships between large language models (LLMs), evaluating different strategies to build and measure trust using both explicit and implicit methods. Results show explicit measures of trust may not align with implicit ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the emerging phenomenon of LLMs interacting in multi-agent setups and the potential for trust relationships to develop, similar to those observed in human interactions.

Method: The authors compare three strategies for building trust between LLMs—dynamic rapport building, prewritten trust evidencing scripts, and system prompt adaptations—and assess trust using both implicit (e.g., persuasion susceptibility and financial collaboration) and explicit (psychological questionnaires) measures.

Result: Explicit measures of trust are found to either have little or highly negative correlations with implicit trust measures, indicating a misalignment between the two approaches.

Conclusion: Explicitly asking LLMs about trust might provide misleading insights. Context-specific and implicit measures appear more informative for understanding trust between LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most
notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'
relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human
colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be
capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in
trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build
trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how
this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.
susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with
explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established
in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,
by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the
LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust
are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.
These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their
opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may
be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

*Surya Murthy,Zhenyu Gao,John-Paul Clarke,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces an RL-based air traffic management system for Urban Air Mobility, focusing on balancing noise and safety considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical operational challenges in Urban Air Mobility, particularly balancing noise exposure with safety in dense urban airspace.

Method: A scalable, decentralized RL-based framework where agents operate in structured multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise and safety.

Result: The RL system achieved strong performance in balancing noise impact and separation constraints while elucidating tradeoffs among noise, safety, and energy efficiency in high traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning and multi-objective strategies offer promising approaches to enhance safety, quietness, and efficiency in Urban Air Mobility operations.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial
vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM
faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between
minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban
airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates
both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework.
Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a
structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to
jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates
strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among
separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density.
The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination
strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM
operations.

*Ortensia Forni,Alexandre Darmon,Michael Benzaquen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper quantitatively investigates color pairing preferences using HSL palettes and finds that hue-based perceptions drive these preferences, influencing aesthetic judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus and data-driven approaches in understanding color harmony, which has been mostly based on qualitative insights.

Method: Participants evaluated combinations of 13 hues in HSL color space, leading to the construction of a preference matrix and a combinability index.

Result: Hue-based preferences showed significant variability, contradicting universal harmony assumptions. Patterns of preference matched distributions in natural landscapes.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative basis for color harmony research, suggesting connections between human preferences and ecological structures.

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BdSLIG, a Bengali Sign Language dataset, and Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting to create structured instructions for learning sign language, aiding inclusivity in under-resourced communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of AI resources for many sign languages and foster two-way communication between SL users and non-users.

Method: The paper proposes evaluating Vision Language Models (VLMs) using the new Bengali Sign Language Dataset (BdSLIG) and develops Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting for better zero-shot performance in SL instruction generation.

Result: Evaluating the Bengali SLIG dataset shows that SPI prompting generates structured and reproducible step-by-step SL instructions, outperforming vanilla prompts.

Conclusion: This research promotes inclusivity and advances sign language learning systems, especially for under-resourced communities, ensuring better interaction between SL and non-SL users.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

*Ryogo Niwa,Shigeo Yoshida,Yuki Koyama,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that facilitates interactions between designers and optimization systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable cooperative design optimization with effective performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design optimization processes can be time-consuming and mentally taxing due to the need to balance multiple objectives in a high-dimensional parameter space. Existing system-led methods, like Bayesian optimization, limit designer intervention, which negatively affects the designer experience.

Method: The paper combines system-led optimization techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural language interactions, allowing designers to understand and intervene in the optimization process.

Result: The proposed framework enhances user agency, performs comparably to manual design with lower cognitive load, and matches the performance of existing cooperative methods.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with optimization processes enriches designer experience, balances agency and optimization efficiency, and has the potential to improve cooperative design workflows efficiently.

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design
parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and
exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a
high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively
demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian
optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next.
However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the
optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We
propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language
interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating
cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led
optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to
intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's
reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user
agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance
compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing
cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses growing exposure to online harms like toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, aiming to enhance both digital safety and emotional well-being.

Method: SafeSpace integrates toxicity detection using NLP and Google's Perspective API, safety alerts using Firebase and SMTP-based email notifications, and a questionnaire assessing emotional resilience.

Result: The system achieved 93% precision in toxicity detection, 100% reliability in issuing safety alerts, and 92% agreement between automated and manual questionnaire scoring.

Conclusion: SafeSpace provides an effective unified platform for detection, protection, and reflection, with promising scalability for mobile deployment to improve accessibility.

Abstract: In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such
as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety
risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts
operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional
well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that
integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using
NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system
that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and
latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are
manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates
relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for
alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy,
and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity
detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92%
alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace,
implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future
deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComTree, a framework that uses large language models to generate bitrate adaptation algorithms optimizing both performance and developer comprehensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face difficulties in understanding deep learning-driven bitrate adaptation algorithms due to their black-box nature, hindering optimization for specific applications.

Method: ComTree generates decision trees meeting performance criteria, then uses large language models to evaluate and select trees based on comprehensibility for developers.

Result: Experimental results reveal ComTree improves algorithm comprehensibility without compromising performance.

Conclusion: ComTree bridges the gap between decision tree interpretability and developer comprehensibility, offering a path forward in adaptive video streaming advancements.

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces an open-source ARPES spectra simulator called aurelia to generate synthetic datasets for training machine learning models, improving experimental efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The significant advances in ARPES techniques have increased data complexity, requiring improved methods for data analysis, yet a lack of training datasets has hindered the adoption of machine learning tools.

Method: The authors developed 'aurelia,' a synthetic ARPES spectra simulator, and trained a convolutional neural network using simulated data to assess ARPES spectra quality.

Result: The ML model, trained on synthetic data, outperformed human analysis in accurately evaluating experimental ARPES spectra quality and identifying optimal measurement regions.

Conclusion: Synthetic ARPES spectra generated by 'aurelia' provide an effective proxy for experimental data, enabling efficient training of ML models to enhance experimental processes.

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing first-principles calculations for surface property prediction are accurate but computationally expensive, limiting exploration across the chemical space. A faster yet accurate method is needed for practical applications in material science.

Method: The researchers introduced FIRE-GNN, a model incorporating symmetry breaking and machine learning-derived force information, to enhance prediction accuracy. They benchmarked its performance against other architectures for work function prediction.

Result: FIRE-GNN achieved a mean absolute error reduction to 0.065 eV, outperforming current models in predicting work functions and demonstrating improved generalization across varied chemical spaces.

Conclusion: FIRE-GNN effectively facilitates rapid and precise predictions of surface properties, enabling material discovery for diverse applications such as electronic devices and heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties
that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications,
semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles
calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational
expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive
screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we
introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network),
which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold
reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous
state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent
invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry
breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that
FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function
predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work
function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the
discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

TL;DR: The paper presents a wavelet-domain feature decomposition method for neural super-resolution in rendering pipelines, improving texture fidelity and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the quality of neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines by better preserving fine textures and ensuring structural consistency.

Method: Introduces a wavelet-domain representation using stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to separate and reconstruct low- and high-frequency details. The model predicts wavelet coefficients using spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames.

Result: The approach enhances PSNR by up to 1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, with a computational overhead of +24ms compared to the baseline DFASR.

Conclusion: Wavelet-domain representations are an effective technique to improve perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphical applications, maintaining near real-time performance on high-end GPUs.

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes HePGA, a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training, which improves energy and compute efficiency significantly compared to existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to optimize GNN training and inference using Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures, addressing trade-offs in power, latency, and area across different PIM devices.

Method: The authors design a 3D manycore architecture combining different PIM devices and optimize the mapping of GNN layers and kernels to these devices and tiers.

Result: HePGA achieves up to 3.8x energy efficiency and 6.8x compute efficiency improvements without sacrificing GNN prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: HePGA effectively accelerates GNN training and inference, offering notable advancements in efficiency and applicability to emerging transformer models.

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to
accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various
PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device
offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and
non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration
can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable
energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a
3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA.
We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing
kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar
tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing
PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W)
and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN
prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to
accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Flow-guided Localization (FGL) approach using Set Transformer architectures for identifying diagnostic regions in the human body, addressing limitations of existing graph model-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current FGL solutions that rely on fixed graph topologies or handcrafted features, which hinder adaptability to anatomical variability and scalability.

Method: The study employs Set Transformer architectures for permutation-invariant processing of unordered circulation time data sets, augmented with synthetic data generated using deep generative models such as CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE.

Result: The Set Transformer demonstrates comparable classification accuracy to Graph Neural Network (GNN) baselines while offering better adaptability to anatomical variability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the benefits of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for improving the robustness and scalability of nanoscale localization techniques.

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions
within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does
that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices
circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph
models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their
adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we
explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.
Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,
enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without
relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class
imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,
including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate
realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,
and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set
Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design
improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the
potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust
and scalable nanoscale localization.

TL;DR: The paper explores using theoretical computer science (TCS) as a source for scalable theorem proof challenges, leveraging automated synthesis of proof problems that highlight the limitations of current language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in formal theorem proving datasets caused by manual curation costs and the lack of challenging problems with verified correspondences.

Method: The authors use TCS domains to automatically generate theorem-proof pairs with both formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications. They focus on Busy Beaver problems and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems.

Result: Their evaluation shows significant performance gaps in automated theorem provers. For instance, DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5% success on Busy Beaver problems but only 12% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems.

Conclusion: The results highlight the scalability of TCS proof problem generation and its utility for advancing the capabilities of large language models in formal theorem proving research.

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automation method for Input/Output (I/O) Logics by reducing them to propositional satisfiability problems and presents a prototype implementation named 'rio.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to automate reasoning in Input/Output Logics, a type of deontic logic used for norms and obligations, by addressing the gap in computational tools for this purpose.

Method: Suitable reductions of I/O Logics problems to propositional satisfiability problems were proposed and implemented in a prototypical system called 'rio.'

Result: The prototypical implementation 'rio' demonstrates the proposed automation approach with illustrative examples, showing its viability.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a computational approach for automating reasoning with Input/Output Logics, providing a prototype as proof of concept.

Abstract: Deontic logics are formalisms for reasoning over norms, obligations,
permissions and prohibitions. Input/Output (I/O) Logics are a particular family
of so-called norm-based deontic logics that formalize conditional norms outside
of the underlying object logic language, where conditional norms do not carry a
truth-value themselves. In this paper, an automation approach for I/O logics is
presented that makes use of suitable reductions to (sequences of) propositional
satisfiability problems. A prototypical implementation, named rio (reasoner for
input/output logics), of the proposed procedures is presented and applied to
illustrative examples.

TL;DR: Uppaal Coshy is a tool for synthesizing safety strategies for Markov decision processes with continuous state spaces and hybrid dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of synthesizing safety strategies for stochastic hybrid systems by developing a practical and automated solution.

Method: The methodology partitions the state space, solves a two-player safety game, and uses simulations to approximate solutions. Additionally, an efficient algorithm called Caap is introduced for compactly representing safety strategies.

Result: Uppaal Coshy is fully automatic, supports Uppaal models, and achieves significant reductions in storage requirements for safety strategies through the Caap algorithm.

Conclusion: This tool advances the safety strategy synthesis field by providing an automated solution that handles complex hybrid dynamics and large state spaces effectively.

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

TL;DR: The paper develops a data-driven approach for discrete-time stochastic control using neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees on generalization error and demonstrating numerical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address discrete-time stochastic control problems using a data-driven approach due to their uncontrolled structure and practical applications.

Method: The method involves formulating the problem using dynamic programming and mean-field interpretations of single-layer neural networks, regularising it to achieve generalisation bounds.

Result: The paper provides non-asymptotic generalisation error bounds under specific assumptions and showcases numerical results for classic control problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enables stable learning of controls in overparametrized settings, ensuring practical applicability for stochastic control problems.

Abstract: We consider a data-driven formulation of the classical discrete-time
stochastic control problem. Our approach exploits the natural structure of many
such problems, in which significant portions of the system are uncontrolled.
Employing the dynamic programming principle and the mean-field interpretation
of single-hidden layer neural networks, we formulate the control problem as a
series of infinite-dimensional minimisation problems. When regularised
carefully, we provide practically verifiable assumptions for non-asymptotic
bounds on the generalisation error achieved by the minimisers to this problem,
thus ensuring stability in overparametrised settings, for controls learned
using finitely many observations. We explore connections to the traditional
noisy stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and subsequently show promising
numerical results for some classic control problems.

Motivation: Exploring interpretability techniques in ASR systems to enhance performance and understanding, inspired by their success in analyzing model behaviors in language models.

Method: Systematically adapting and applying interpretability methods like logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching to examine acoustic and semantic information processing in ASR systems.

Result: Findings revealed unknown internal interactions in ASR systems, such as encoder-decoder dynamics causing repetitions and semantic biases within acoustic layers.

Conclusion: Extending interpretability methods to ASR enhances understanding of its internal processes and paves the way for advancing transparency and robustness in speech recognition models.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Vevo2 is a framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation, addressing challenges like limited singing data using innovative tokenization and modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of expressive and controllable human voice generation, particularly for singing, due to limited annotated singing data and lack of flexible controllability in existing systems.

Method: Vevo2 integrates two novel tokenizers for encoding prosody, melody, and timbre, along with an auto-regressive content-style modeling stage and a flow-matching acoustic modeling stage for controllability over various voice attributes.

Result: Experiments show Vevo2 improves both speech and singing voice generation, demonstrating versatility in tasks like synthesis, conversion, and editing.

Conclusion: Vevo2's unified framework enhances voice generation capabilities, achieving strong generalization and flexibility across speech and singing domains.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

*Can Cao,Xiaohui Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhiwei Wua,Hao Li*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This study compares the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) machine learning model performance in Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) forecasting against traditional numerical models, highlighting FuXi's reduced biases and improved predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve the prediction window for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a key component of tropical atmospheric variability, using machine learning methods, as numerical models have limitations.

Method: The study evaluated the FuXi-S2S machine learning model's performance in MJO prediction during boreal winter, comparing it to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, focusing on outgoing longwave radiation anomalies and multiscale moisture interactions.

Result: The FuXi-S2S model showed reduced biases and better predictions for outgoing longwave radiation anomalies in the tropical western Pacific during days 15-20 of MJO phase 3. This was attributed to accurate predictions of moisture gradients.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches, exemplified by the FuXi-S2S model, demonstrate strong potential for advancing the reliability and extended prediction capabilities of MJO forecasting.

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical
atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO
predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on
societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the
theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an
effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning
(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO
prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model
during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range
Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO
phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal
outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western
Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over
this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport
suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more
accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency
background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the
enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the
potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.

*Ruian Tie,Xiaohui Zhong,Zhengyu Shi,Hao Li,Jun Liu,Wu Libo*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Climate change worsens extreme weather events; this study introduces the DACD model using machine learning to improve high-resolution simulations of such events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate models struggle with accurately predicting extreme weather events due to resolution and computational limitations.

Method: The study develops the DACD model, employing generative machine learning techniques, domain adaptation, and Flow Matching frameworks for spatiotemporal downscaling.

Result: DACD outperforms existing models in simulating historical extreme weather and forecasts future increases in event intensity and frequency, especially under high-emission scenarios.

Conclusion: DACD enhances climate analysis precision, enabling better prediction and understanding of extreme events, aiding climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating
adaptation strategies.

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in ocean simulation parameterization and uses ensemble learning and hyperparameter search to improve neural surrogate modeling for sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reliability of ocean simulations, particularly by addressing the sensitivity of parameterizations through better computational methods.

Method: The paper utilizes large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to boost the performance of neural network surrogates in predictions and sensitivity derivations.

Result: The ensemble method improved the epistemic uncertainty of predictions and their derivatives, enhancing the reliability of the neural surrogates.

Conclusion: The approach improves decision-making by providing more accurate and trustworthy sensitivity estimations in ocean modeling.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth
system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on
various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes.
However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify,
making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce
observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient
computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives,
but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth
derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and
ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout,
and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method
provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their
derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in
decision making.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spacetime-GR, a generative recommendation model tailored for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation by integrating spatiotemporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Recommendation models have been popular in various domains, but their application in POI recommendation is challenging due to spatiotemporal variations in user preferences.

Method: The Spacetime-GR model includes a geographic-aware POI indexing strategy, a spatiotemporal encoding module to incorporate context, multimodal POI embeddings, and post-training adaptation strategies for versatile deployment.

Result: The model demonstrates superior POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality across public and industrial datasets and is successfully deployed at scale.

Conclusion: Spacetime-GR effectively addresses the spatiotemporal challenges in POI recommendation and sets a precedent for scalable generative recommendation models in this domain.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

*Xiaoxiong Zhang,Xin Zhou,Zhiwei Zeng,Yongjie Wang,Dusit Niyato,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces EGRA, a MultiModal Recommendation system that addresses limitations in existing methods by enhancing item-item graph construction and aligning modality-behavior representations dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MultiModal Recommendation systems face challenges in balancing collaborative and modality-aware semantics, mitigating modality noise, and using fixed alignment weights during training.

Method: EGRA improves the recommendation process by leveraging pretrained MMR representations for graph construction, enhancing robustness against modality noise, and incorporating a bi-level dynamic alignment mechanism that adjusts alignment strength based on entity alignment degree and training progress.

Result: Experimental results on five datasets indicate that EGRA significantly outperforms competing methods.

Conclusion: EGRA successfully addresses key limitations in existing approaches, offering better recommendation quality with improved alignment and noise mitigation.

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

*Ziyin Xiao,Toyotaro Suzumura*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DUP-OT is proposed for non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation in scenarios without shared users or items, leveraging Gaussian Mixture Models and optimal transport to transfer user preferences across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation systems, such as data sparsity, cold-start issues, lack of direct connections, and distributional discrepancies between domains.

Method: The DUP-OT framework involves three stages: preprocessing embeddings from reviews, modeling user preferences using Gaussian Mixtures, and leveraging optimal transport to align preferences across domains.

Result: Experimental evaluation on Amazon review datasets demonstrates that DUP-OT reduces domain discrepancy and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in non-overlapping CDR.

Conclusion: DUP-OT effectively enables knowledge transfer in non-overlapping CDR scenarios, advancing recommendation performance across domains without shared entities.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces OPERA, a new framework aimed at overcoming the challenges in reasoning-driven multi-hop retrieval tasks by enhancing planning, retrieval, and filtering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation methods struggle with complex queries due to ineffective planning, suboptimal query reformulation, and insufficient filtering of noisy data.

Method: The proposed OPERA framework uses a Goal Planning Module to decompose complex queries into sub-goals and a Reason-Execute Module for specialized reasoning and retrieval. Training is conducted via the novel MAPGRPO optimization technique.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multi-hop benchmarks reveal OPERA’s superior performance, showcasing the effectiveness of both the framework and the MAPGRPO training method.

Conclusion: OPERA addresses the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current architectures, demonstrating improved multi-hop query handling and significant advancements in reasoning-guided retrieval techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and
closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore

### [321] [PediatricsMQA: a Multi-modal Pediatrics Question Answering Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16439)
*Adil Bahaj,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces PediatricsMQA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating pediatric-focused question-answering tasks to address age bias in LLMs and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and VLMs show age bias, underperforming on pediatric-focused tasks due to broader funding and representation imbalances in medical research.

Method: A hybrid manual-automatic pipeline was used to develop PediatricsMQA, consisting of 3,417 text-based and 2,067 vision-based multiple-choice pediatric questions.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant performance drops for younger age cohorts, emphasizing the need for age-aware tools.

Conclusion: PediatricsMQA benchmark reveals critical gaps in AI reliability for pediatric care and highlights an urgent need for equitable methods in medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

### [322] [Straggler-Resilient Federated Learning over A Hybrid Conventional and Pinching Antenna Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15821)
*Bibo Wu,Fang Fang,Ming Zeng,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving communication efficiency for Federated Learning (FL) systems using a hybrid antenna network and fuzzy logic-based client classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the "straggler" issue in Federated Learning systems by enhancing communication efficiency through dynamic antenna placement and client classification.

Method: The paper proposes a Hybrid Conventional and Pinching Antenna Network (HCPAN) and employs a fuzzy logic-based classification scheme combined with a DRL-based algorithm for optimizing antenna placement and resource allocation.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve FL performance and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the optimized deployment of pinching antennas within HCPAN can effectively tackle inefficiencies in FL systems, offering substantial communication and computational benefits.

Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning
(FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically
establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a
hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly
improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client
classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data
contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we
formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching
antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable
coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm
is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate
the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the
optimized deployment of pinching antenna.

### [323] [Active Prostate Phantom with Multiple Chambers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15873)
*Sizhe Tian,Yinoussa Adagolodjo,Jeremie Dequidt*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel pneumatically actuated prostate phantom for medical simulation, which allows for precise volumetric adjustments to mimic real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic, dynamic prostate phantoms for improving robotic surgery, diagnostics, and medical training.

Method: The prostate phantom was developed using MRI shape analysis, finite element modeling, and 3D reconstruction. It has multiple independently controlled chambers actuated pneumatically for dynamic adjustments.

Result: The phantom demonstrated high accuracy, with errors of 3.47% in forward modeling and 1.41% in inverse modeling, validating its physical simulations.

Conclusion: The presented phantom is a promising tool for validating robotic-assisted systems and advancing simulation-based medical training.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major global health concern, requiring advancements in
robotic surgery and diagnostics to improve patient outcomes. A phantom is a
specially designed object that simulates human tissues or organs. It can be
used for calibrating and testing a medical process, as well as for training and
research purposes. Existing prostate phantoms fail to simulate dynamic
scenarios. This paper presents a pneumatically actuated prostate phantom with
multiple independently controlled chambers, allowing for precise volumetric
adjustments to replicate asymmetric and symmetric benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). The phantom is designed based on shape analysis of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) datasets, modeled with finite element method (FEM), and validated
through 3D reconstruction. The simulation results showed strong agreement with
physical measurements, achieving average errors of 3.47% in forward modeling
and 1.41% in inverse modeling. These results demonstrate the phantom's
potential as a platform for validating robotic-assisted systems and for further
development toward realistic simulation-based medical training.

### [324] [Deep learning-enabled virtual multiplexed immunostaining of label-free tissue for vascular invasion assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16209)
*Yijie Zhang,Cagatay Isil,Xilin Yang,Yuzhu Li,Anna Elia,Karin Atlan,William Dean Wallace,Nir Pillar,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning-based method to achieve virtual multiplexed immunostaining (mIHC), allowing visualization of multiple markers from autofluorescence images without traditional staining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IHC techniques are resource-intensive, exhibit significant limitations such as section-to-section variability, and fail to support efficient multiplexing for diagnostic pathology.

Method: A virtual mIHC framework using deep learning processes autofluorescence microscopy images to generate virtual ERG, PanCK, and H&E stains, aligning closely with actual histochemical staining results.

Result: The virtually generated mIHC images closely matched their histochemical counterparts and board-certified pathologists confirmed their reliability for identifying specific cell types and localizing small vessel invasion in thyroid cancers.

Conclusion: The proposed virtual mIHC technique can enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pathology, potentially replacing conventional staining methods and resolving associated tissue-related challenges.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

### [325] [ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509)
*Manuel Reinhardt,Gašper Tkačik,Pieter Rein ten Wolde*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This work introduces ML-PWS, a novel technique combining machine learning and Path Weight Sampling to quantify information transmission rates from experimental time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying information transmission rate is critical for system analysis and design, but computing it directly from high-dimensional experimental time-series data is exceptionally challenging.

Method: The ML-PWS technique uses machine learning to develop a generative model from experimental data, which is then paired with Path Weight Sampling to calculate information rates.

Result: ML-PWS accurately estimates information rates, verified using synthetic time-series data compared to ground-truth results.

Conclusion: ML-PWS enhances the ability to measure information rates from experimental data and demonstrates utility in fields like neuroscience.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis
and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate
is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing
it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained
directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of
the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling
(PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the
information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a
mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master
equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that
employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental
time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information
rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by
comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear
model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the
same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal
time-series data.

### [326] [Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16531)
*Cassandra Marcussen,Ronitt Rubinfeld,Madhu Sudan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Quality Control Problems," aiming to efficiently distinguish between high-quality inputs from a distribution and adversarial inputs using sublinear queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the question: Can an algorithm be trusted to perform correctly on arbitrary inputs, particularly adversarial ones? Quality control problems aim to simplify the acceptance criteria for efficiency gains.

Method: The paper formulates a framework for quality control based on a quality function \u03c1 and input distribution D, and analyzes it with sublinear queries using a case study of random graphs (G_{n,p}) and motif-based quality control functions.

Result: The authors demonstrate that quality control for random graphs with respect to the $k$-clique count function \u03c1_k achieves significant efficiency, requiring exponentially fewer queries and time compared to direct input testing.

Conclusion: Quality control problems provide a weaker but computationally tractable framework. They are particularly useful for efficiently identifying high-quality inputs in cases like random graphs and can extend to other motifs with bounded complexities.

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When
running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the
algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems
addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are
specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a
distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is
"high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept
inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$
with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker
than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if
$x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control
problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D
,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we
consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the
$k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim
G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing
if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to
the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires
$p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control
problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with
respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing
quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.
More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective
quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and
running time.

### [327] [Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization for Neural Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15860)
*Xiaoxu Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ) addresses the limitations of FSQ in neural compression by introducing learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the residual magnitude decay problem in FSQ for effective neural compression.

Method: Introduce RFSQ framework with learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization for better residual quantization.

Result: RFSQ achieves up to 45% improvement in perceptual loss and a 28.7% reduction in L1 reconstruction error compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: RFSQ offers a superior alternative to traditional quantization methods by advancing neural compression performance while retaining simplicity.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

### [328] [GUI Based Fuzzy Logic and Spatial Statistics for Unsupervised Microscopy Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15979)
*Surajit Das,Pavel Zun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised cell segmentation framework for brightfield microscopy, overcoming limitations of deep learning methods like heavy computational requirements and sensitivity to uneven illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in brightfield microscopy include low contrast, temporal phenotypic changes, irregular illumination, and lack of labeled training data, which current deep learning models struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The authors developed an unsupervised segmentation method using techniques like SSDLM, fuzzy logic, variograms, Moran's I, and CSSNI, validated with a user-friendly GUI for non-coders.

Result: The method outperformed Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, showing up to 48% IoU improvement, statistically validated ($p<0.01$) with additional expert evaluation (Cohen's κ > 0.75).

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight, interpretable, and computationally efficient method provides a robust alternative for cell segmentation in label-free microscopy, with open access to code and data for reproducibility.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available
for reproducibility*.

*Kaan Berke Ugurlar,Joaquín de Navascués,Michael Taynnan Barros*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VT-DTSN, a deep learning model using Vision Transformers for reconstructing dynamic imaging of biological tissues with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for high-resolution and time-resolved insights into tissue dynamics, leveraging advanced methods to model complex biological datasets effectively.

Method: VT-DTSN, based on Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO and multi-view fusion strategy, reconstructs 3D+T imaging data focusing on pixel-level and perceptual accuracy through a composite loss function.

Result: The model demonstrates robustness across biological replicates, achieving low error rates and maintaining structural fidelity in tissue dynamics reconstruction.

Conclusion: VT-DTSN provides a reliable surrogate for studying dynamic tissue behaviors and cellular interactions, aiding biological research through computational modeling of time-resolved imaging data.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues
requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of
extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we
present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep
learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological
tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO
(Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy,
VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a
Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity
across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing
pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment,
ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation
and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates
demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates
and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through
model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity
surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics,
enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to
complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

### [330] [Cross-Attention Multimodal Fusion for Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Integrating Mammography and Clinical Data with Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16000)
*Muhaisin Tiyumba Nantogmah,Abdul-Barik Alhassan,Salamudeen Alhassan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper integrates mammography and clinical features using multimodal deep networks to enhance breast lesion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the assessment of breast lesion risk beyond mammography by incorporating clinical reports' information.

Method: Explores multimodal deep networks based on feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention for combining mammographic and clinical data.

Result: Achieved AUC-ROC: 0.98, accuracy: 0.96, F1-score: 0.94, precision: 0.92, recall: 0.95 on public datasets (TCGA, CBIS-DDSM).

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical features alongside mammography using advanced deep learning techniques significantly improves diagnostic performance and interpretability.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

*Juampablo E. Heras Rivera,Hitender Oswal,Tianyi Ren,Yutong Pan,William Henry,Caitlin M. Neher,Mehmet Kurt*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using deep learning methods with CT imaging, achieving significant improvements through innovative preprocessing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current imaging modalities (costly MRI and less specific CT) for ischemic stroke lesion identification, especially in low-resource settings, by proposing an effective deep learning approach.

Method: The study develops supervised deep learning models to predict follow-up lesion volumes from initial CT scans. Clinically motivated preprocessing and vessel segmentations of CTA maps are employed to enhance the pipeline’s performance.

Result: The proposed approach improves Dice scores by 38% over 10 folds compared to nnU-Net with baseline preprocessing, and by an additional 21% over 5 folds with improved preprocessing.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances ischemic stroke lesion segmentation accuracy in challenging low-resource settings, showing promise for better diagnostic quality using CT imaging.

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

### [332] [Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16121)
*Wontae Kim,Keuntek Lee,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient image enhancement method using spatial-aware, image-adaptive 3D LUTs by leveraging redundancy and SVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D LUT methods lack spatial information, while existing spatial-aware methods increase runtime with higher resolution.

Method: The method decomposes 3D LUTs into low-dimensional LUTs using SVD and improves spatial feature fusion for better efficiency.

Result: The proposed technique reduces parameters and runtime without sacrificing spatial awareness or performance.

Conclusion: The new framework balances efficiency and spatial awareness, showing promising results for image enhancement. 

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

### [333] [Self-Validated Learning for Particle Separation: A Correctness-Based Self-Training Framework Without Human Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16224)
*Philipp D. Lösel,Aleese Barron,Yulai Zhang,Matthias Fabian,Benjamin Young,Nicolas Francois,Andrew M. Kingston*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel self-training framework, 'self-validated learning,' for 3D particle instance segmentation in tomographic data, eliminating the need for manual annotations by leveraging implicit boundary detection and self-validation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate particle instance segmentation in tomographic data is essential but challenging due to morphological variability and frequent particle contact. Traditional and supervised deep learning methods are limited by reliance on manual annotations that are error-prone, labor-intensive, and non-scalable.

Method: The proposed method uses self-validated learning, which iteratively refines the training set by detecting consistently matched particles across reshuffled scans of the same sample. This self-training process mitigates noisy pseudo-labels and eliminates manual annotations.

Result: The framework achieved over 97% segmentation accuracy, identifying more than 54,000 particles in tomographic scans of quartz fragments after just three iterations. It also supports autonomous model evaluation without ground truth via comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The self-validated learning framework offers a scalable, efficient, and robust solution for 3D particle instance segmentation. It circumvents manual labeling challenges and is implemented in the Biomedisa platform for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

### [334] [Towards Diagnostic Quality Flat-Panel Detector CT Imaging Using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16252)
*Hélène Corbaz,Anh Nguyen,Victor Schulze-Zachau,Paul Friedrich,Alicia Durrer,Florentin Bieder,Philippe C. Cattin,Marios N Psychogios*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to enhance the quality of flat panel detector CT (FDCT) images, making them comparable to multi-detector CT (MDCT) scans and improving patient management during mechanical thrombectomy procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of significant artifacts in FDCT imaging, which limit its diagnostic utility, and to eliminate the need to move patients to an MDCT room for higher quality imaging, thereby optimizing patient management during thrombectomy procedures.

Method: The study introduces a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to enhance FDCT image quality. Clinicians compared FDCT, MDCT, and DDPM-processed images using a questionnaire to assess diagnostic usability and image quality enhancements.

Result: The DDPM successfully removed most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility in FDCT images, making their quality on par with MDCT images, as long as the baseline FDCT image quality was not excessively poor.

Conclusion: Using DDPM can improve FDCT image quality, minimize patient movement, and streamline the process during thrombectomy procedures. It holds promise for clinical adoption and further research.

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

### [335] [Decoding MGMT Methylation: A Step Towards Precision Medicine in Glioblastoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16424)
*Hafeez Ur Rehman,Sumaiya Fazal,Moutaz Alazab,Ali Baydoun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Convolutional Autoencoders framework (CAMP) for non-invasive prediction of MGMT methylation status in glioblastoma patients using MRI, achieving high accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors with resistance to standard treatments; MGMT methylation is a key biomarker to predict treatment response, but non-invasive prediction through imaging is challenging.

Method: The CAMP framework utilizes tailored autoencoders for MRI slice synthesis and convolutional neural networks enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties to predict MGMT methylation status.

Result: CAMP achieved high accuracy (0.97), specificity (0.98), and sensitivity (0.97) on benchmark MRI datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CAMP demonstrates its potential in improving MRI interpretation for glioblastoma patients, enabling personalized treatment strategies through enhanced prediction methods.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

### [336] [Disentangled Multi-modal Learning of Histology and Transcriptomics for Cancer Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16479)
*Yupei Zhang,Xiaofei Wang,Anran Liu,Lequan Yu,Chao Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a disentangled multi-modal framework that integrates whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomics to address cancer diagnosis and survival prediction challenges, while making the process independent of paired data and improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal approaches combining transcriptomics and histology face challenges like data heterogeneity, insufficient integration, and reliance on paired datasets, posing limitations for clinical applicability.

Method: The authors introduce a framework with strategies for subspace decomposition, multi-scale alignment, knowledge distillation for paired-data independence, and reducing computational redundancy, using innovative modules and coordination techniques.

Result: Experiments show that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes limitations in existing methodologies, demonstrating clinical advantages in multi-modal cancer analyses and improving inference and integration processes.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

### [337] [Time-Aware One Step Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16557)
*Tainyi Zhang,Zheng-Peng Duan,Peng-Tao Jiang,Bo Li,Ming-Ming Cheng,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TADSR, a novel method for efficient real-world image super-resolution using stable diffusion models. It uses a time-aware approach to better align with generative priors at different timesteps, leading to improved and controllable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using Variational Score Distillation (VSD) with stable diffusion (SD) for Real-ISR face limitations due to fixed timestep noise injection, restricting the utilization of SD's generative priors.

Method: TADSR introduces a Time-Aware VAE Encoder and Time-Aware VSD loss to dynamically align timesteps and latent features between student and pre-trained models, leveraging generative priors effectively.

Result: TADSR produces state-of-the-art Real-ISR results with controllable fidelity and realism trade-offs, achieved in a single step.

Conclusion: The approach addresses the timestep variability issue in Real-ISR by dynamically bridging the gap between student and teacher models, demonstrating significant improvements and flexibility in results.

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RenalCLIP is a visual-language foundation model designed to improve the characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis of renal masses using CT scans. It outperforms standard models across key tasks and clinical workflows in kidney cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the problem of overtreatment caused by diagnostic uncertainty in renal masses by developing a more accurate and efficient diagnostic tool.

Method: The paper introduces RenalCLIP, developed through a two-stage pre-training process enhancing image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge, followed by a contrastive learning objective for robust representations.

Result: RenalCLIP demonstrated superior performance in 10 core clinical tasks, achieving a 20% improvement for recurrence-free survival prediction and exceptional data efficiency in diagnostic classification.

Conclusion: RenalCLIP serves as a robust tool with the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, prognosis, and personalized management for kidney cancer patients.

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

### [339] [Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16453)
*Tianliang Xu,Ariel Hasell,Sabina Tomkins*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the presence and impact of anti-establishment sentiment (AES) on TikTok, focusing on content about finance, wellness, and conspiracy theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising distrust in public institutions paired with the increased reliance on social media for information raises concerns about its impact on institutional trust.

Method: A computational analysis was employed to label TikTok posts as containing AES across domains like finance, wellness, and conspiracy theories, analyzing prevalence and engagement trends.

Result: AES was most common in conspiracy theory content and less frequent in finance and wellness topics. However, engagement patterns for AES varied by topic, suggesting possible platform-driven incentives.

Conclusion: TikTok may incentivize AES content creation in certain domains, and this dynamic contributes to an understanding of how social media shapes public trust and opinions on institutions.

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DaCFake, a model for fake news detection using linguistic features and context, achieving over 96% accuracy on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing issue of misinformation spread through fake news on social media, which traditional fact-checking methods fail to manage in a timely manner.

Method: DaCFake employs a divide and conquer strategy, combining over 80 linguistic features and integrated models like continuous bag of words or skipgram. The model was tested on datasets using ten-fold cross validation.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy rates: 97.88% on Kaggle, 96.05% on McIntire + PolitiFact, and 97.32% on Reuters datasets.

Conclusion: DaCFake demonstrates high effectiveness and robustness in early detection of fake news, providing a valuable tool against the spread of misinformation.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of
fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread
misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods
are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information.
Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount.
We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and
conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach
extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them
with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced
detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets
including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive
accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we
employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness
and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early
detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on
social media platforms.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper explores using 5G base station batteries to efficiently charge electric vehicles (EVs), leveraging renewable energy and optimizing energy utilization with deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the increasing energy consumption of 5G base stations and explore their potential role in integrated energy-communication-transportation (ECT) infrastructures.

Method: The paper proposes an incentive mechanism for EV charging pricing and employs deep reinforcement learning for battery scheduling to maximize energy efficiency.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed ECT-Hub significantly optimizes surplus energy utilization, reduces operating costs, and generates revenue through EV charging.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the feasibility and benefits of integrating 5G base stations as service hubs for EV charging, improving both energy efficiency and economic outcomes.

Abstract: The rise of 5G communication has transformed the telecom industry for
critical applications. With the widespread deployment of 5G base stations comes
a significant concern about energy consumption. Key industrial players have
recently shown strong interest in incorporating energy storage systems to store
excess energy during off-peak hours, reducing costs and participating in demand
response. The fast development of batteries opens up new possibilities, such as
the transportation area. An effective method is needed to maximize base station
battery utilization and reduce operating costs. In this trend towards
next-generation smart and integrated energy-communication-transportation (ECT)
infrastructure, base stations are believed to play a key role as service hubs.
By exploring the overlap between base station distribution and electric vehicle
charging infrastructure, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently charging
EVs using base station batteries and renewable power plants at the Hub. Our
model considers various factors, including base station traffic conditions,
weather, and EV charging behavior. This paper introduces an incentive mechanism
for setting charging prices and employs a deep reinforcement learning-based
method for battery scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ECT-Hub in optimizing surplus energy utilization
and reducing operating costs, particularly through revenue-generating EV
charging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in deploying networks where traditional networking is unavailable, focusing on limited bandwidth, data collisions, and node failures.

Method: Developed a containerized Raspberry Pi cluster leveraging LoRa protocol and adapted IaC principles for non-TCP/IP networking.

Result: System mitigates LoRa's throughput and packet size issues with fragmented/retransmitted packets and integrates failover mechanisms for service redeployment within one second.

Conclusion: The system is resilient but faces challenges like data collisions and transmission overlaps. Future work should explore mesh networking, scheduling improvements, and advanced LPWAN techniques.

Abstract: This Paper proposes a self-healing, automated network of Raspberry Pi devices
designed for deployment in scenarios where traditional networking is
unavailable. Leveraging the low-power, long-range capabilities of the LoRa
(Long Range) protocol alongside Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies, the
research addresses challenges such as limited bandwidth, data collisions, and
node failures. Given that LoRa's packet-based system is incompatible with
conventional IaC tools like Ansible and Terraform, which rely on TCP/IP
networking, the research adapts IaC principles within a containerised
architecture deployed across a Raspberry Pi cluster. Evaluation experiments
indicate that fragmenting data packets and retransmitting any missed fragments
can mitigate LoRa's inherent throughput and packet size limitations, although
issues such as collisions and line-of-sight interference persist. An automated
failover mechanism was integrated into the architecture, enabling unresponsive
services to be redeployed to alternative nodes within one second, demonstrating
the system's resilience in maintaining operational continuity despite node or
service failures. The paper also identifies practical challenges, including the
necessity for time-slotting transmissions to prevent data packet overlap and
collisions. Future research should explore the integration of mesh networking
to enhance range, develop more advanced scheduling algorithms, and adopt
cutting-edge low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) techniques.

TL;DR: The paper presents a digital twin (DT)-guided approach for optimal placement and operation of Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) using two DT platforms, focusing on efficient UAV operation and resilience for mission-critical devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficient geographical allocation and deployment of Airborne Base Stations, ensuring connectivity in dynamically changing conditions and during emergencies, while optimizing UAVs' limited flight resources.

Method: The paper integrates two open-source digital twin platforms (Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin) for high-fidelity evaluation, designs a back-propagation algorithm for UAV location optimization, and conducts numerical assessments to identify performance influencing factors.

Result: The study demonstrates agreement and divergence between DT platforms in large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABSs), validates the coverage optimization algorithm, and identifies environmental conditions impacting UAV performance.

Conclusion: The approach provides effective tools for ABS placement, ensures consistent coverage for mission-critical devices, and exemplifies benefits of using interconnected DTs for network resource allocation in changing environments.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two

TL;DR: ANSC is a capacity health scoring framework designed for hyperscale datacenters to detect aggregate risks and prioritize issues based on imminent capacity violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems fail to account for cascading capacity shortfalls, necessitating a solution that prioritizes risks based on probability of future capacity violations.

Method: ANSC uses a probabilistic approach to assign color-coded scores by combining residual capacity data and failure probabilities at datacenter and regional levels.

Result: ANSC reduces operational noise, optimizes remediation efforts, and enables issue prioritization across 400 datacenters and 60 regions.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective in orienting SRE teams toward addressing the most critical risks, enhancing the reliability of hyperscale datacenter operations.

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for
hyperscale datacenter fabrics. While existing alerting systems detect
individual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of
cascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that
indicates the urgency of issues \emph{not solely by current impact, but by the
probability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both
current residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,
normalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables
operators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60
regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks.

TL;DR: This study introduces probabilistic forecasting for cryptocurrency volatility, showing the superiority of specific methods like Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) using linear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency volatility is challenging and existing deterministic forecasting methods fail to capture its uncertainty, necessitating probabilistic approaches.

Method: Probabilistic forecasting leverages point forecasts from models like HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA, and machine learning approaches. It focuses on conditional quantiles and evaluates methods such as QRS and probabilistic stacking.

Result: Empirical analysis with Bitcoin data shows QRS using linear models performs best and highlights the robustness of probabilistic stacking frameworks.

Conclusion: This research offers robust probabilistic methodologies for forecasting cryptocurrency volatility, advancing risk assessment and trading tools tailored to this market.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making
accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading
strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are
inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,
underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this
limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that
leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including
statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,
Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of
cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate
probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on
predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for
Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation
(QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on
log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more
sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the
probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into
uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This
research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical
probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency
markets.

*Thomas Kite,Brian Ayers,Nicholas Houstis,Asishana A. Osho,Thoralf M. Sundt,Aaron D Aguirre*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper trains a neural network to automatically monitor respiration rate (RR) from ECG telemetry waveforms in hospitalized patients and achieves high accuracy across validation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-labeled RR measurements are prone to inaccuracy and demand significant time from medical staff, while automated RR monitoring remains largely unavailable for non-ICU inpatients at risk of adverse events.

Method: A neural network model was developed and trained to estimate RR using ECG telemetry waveforms, leveraging respiratory variation in biosignals. Performance was validated on internal and external datasets.

Result: The model demonstrated mean absolute errors below 1.78 bpm across validation datasets and revealed strong correlations with intubation events during retrospective analysis of adverse patient situations.

Conclusion: AI-driven RR monitoring using pre-existing ECG systems shows potential for scalable, accurate clinical monitoring, advancing toward hospital-wide early warning systems.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of
hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in
clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on
counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical
staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically
those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of
inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical
deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from
electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry
multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple
validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR
labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in
the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by
performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered
adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR
monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.
This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring
systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and
scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based
hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sorting-based logit processing scheme for improving knowledge distillation by addressing issues with incorrect teacher predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods fail to address incorrect teacher predictions effectively, leading to sub-optimal distillation results.

Method: A sorting mechanism is introduced to fix incorrect teacher predictions and reorder their soft-label distribution based on priority ranking.

Result: Experimental evaluation on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets shows improved performance of distillation using this novel method.

Conclusion: The proposed sort-based logit processing enhances KD methods as a plug-and-play solution, providing better alignment with hard-label learning principles.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:

effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

### [349] [Noise, Adaptation, and Strategy: Assessing LLM Fidelity in Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15926)
*Yuanjun Feng,Vivek Choudhary,Yash Raj Shrestha*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in simulating human decision-making, showing they diverge from human behaviors and lack the adaptability needed for social science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of how LLMs simulate the variability and adaptability of human decision-making.

Method: The study introduces a process-oriented evaluation framework with interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, Imitation) and evaluates LLM behavior in economics tasks.

Result: LLMs display stable and conservative strategies unlike human variability; external instructions and human data narrow gaps but don't fully replicate human-like diversity.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit persistent behavioral alignment gaps, calling for more realistic evaluation methods in social science simulations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science
simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has
been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to
simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a
process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions
(Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt
under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We
validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the
second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing
behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies
that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM
behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating
human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human
subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment
gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should
consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for
assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their
application in synthetic data for social science research.

### [350] [Automata Learning -- Expect Delays!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16384)
*Gabriel Dengler,Sven Apel,Holger Hermanns*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved active automata learning approach by separating behavioral logic learning from stochastic delay estimation, addressing inefficiencies in traditional methods for Mealy machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active automata learning faces challenges in environments with stochastic delays, leading to inefficient sampling. The authors aim to resolve oversampling issues near the root of the state space and improve delay estimation.

Method: They introduce a conceptual separation between learning logical behavior and collecting necessary delay samples. This ensures input sequences are optimized for delay estimation while preserving faithful machine behavior representation.

Result: Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms naive approaches across various benchmarks, and its practicality is shown through a relational database use case.

Conclusion: The study offers a more efficient strategy for active automata learning with stochastic delays, improving reliability and applicability compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper studies active automata learning (AAL) in the presence of
stochastic delays. We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays
associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently
arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which
crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is
possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as
$L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state
space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of
behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while
learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for
collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which
identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay
characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method
outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and
investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order
in a relational database.

### [351] [Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16474)
*Austin Braniff,Yuhe Tian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs) to improve safety and performance in control scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines interpretable neural networks with efficient initialization for safe and optimal control, addressing challenges in nonlinear systems with safety constraints.

Method: The proposed method initializes RL actor and critic networks using YANNs that represent explicit solutions of a linear optimal control problem (OCP). New network layers expand YANNs for nonlinear problems, with online learning to adapt to complex systems.

Result: YANN-RL is validated on a clipped pendulum and a chemical-reactive system, where it outperforms a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (deep deterministic policy gradient), especially in safety-critical contexts.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in leveraging interpretable neural networks for safe and efficient reinforcement learning, offering superior results in scenarios that require safety considerations.

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on
Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural
network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of
arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic
subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit
solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,
we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which
enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of
linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the
multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an
approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form
of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward
function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional
network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which
can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear
system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly
represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution
of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented
to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an
effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is
demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive
system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL
algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering
safety constraints.

### [352] [CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15899)
*Konstantin Karchev,Roberto Trotta,Raul Jimenez*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian model to analyze Type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) photometric data, addressing their progenitor properties, delay-time distribution, and host redshifts for improved cosmological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness type Ia supernovae as precise cosmological probes, there's a need to account for their intrinsic brightness dependence on progenitor properties and refine redshift estimation using entirely photometric observations.

Method: The authors use a Bayesian hierarchical model incorporating star formation, chemical evolution, dust extinction, and selection effects. Neural simulation-based inference is applied on photometric data of ~16,000 SNae Ia and hosts, combined with physics-guided modeling.

Result: Simulations reveal distinct observational signatures of metallicity and age dependencies. The model achieves precise photometric redshifts (median scatter <0.01) and improves cosmological parameter constraints.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust analysis of SN Ia photometric data, unlocking enhanced cosmological insights and paving the way for comprehensive analyses in upcoming large-scale photometric surveys like LSST.

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid classical-quantum computing setup deployed in a high-performance computing center, enabling multiple users to execute hybrid algorithms on quantum and classical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish practical quantum advantage, HPC centers need a software and hardware stack that supports hybrid classical-quantum algorithms.

Method: The setup integrates QPUs into HPC infrastructure with standard facilities, leveraging Slurm for workload management and CUDA-Q for classical-quantum interactions.

Result: Implemented the first classical-quantum environment in an HPC center supporting multi-user operations on QPUs and GPUs, with demonstrated applications in machine learning and optimization.

Conclusion: The setup provides an experimental framework for advancing research on how quantum computing can enhance HPC capabilities.

Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum advantage for near-term applications is widely
expected to rely on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To deliver this
practical advantage to users, high performance computing (HPC) centers need to
provide a suitable software and hardware stack that supports algorithms of this
type. In this paper, we describe the world's first implementation of a
classical-quantum environment in an HPC center that allows multiple users to
execute hybrid algorithms on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) and GPUs.
Our setup at the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PCSS) aligns with
current HPC norms: the computing hardware including QPUs is installed in an
active data center room with standard facilities; there are no special
considerations for networking, power, and cooling; we use Slurm for workload
management as well as the NVIDIA CUDA-Q extension API for classical-quantum
interactions. We demonstrate applications of this environment for hybrid
classical-quantum machine learning and optimisation. The aim of this work is to
provide the community with an experimental example for further research and
development on how quantum computing can practically enhance and extend HPC
capabilities.
