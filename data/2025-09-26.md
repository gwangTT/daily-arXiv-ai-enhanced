### [1] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a temporal expression language to monitor and detect errors in AI agent behaviors, focusing on sequences of actions rather than textual outputs for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for systematic error-detection in LLM-based agentic systems, which suffer from fragile behavior validation due to stochastic variability in natural language outputs.

Method: The method adapts temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor agent execution traces, capturing sequence-based behavioral patterns through a temporal expression language.

Result: The approach was tested on a three-agent system, identifying behavioral anomalies in instances using smaller models due to coordination failures and improper tool sequencing, while larger models maintained correct behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed validation method is effective for monitoring AI agent behavior, providing a robust foundation for reliability testing in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [2] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling (LATTS), a method leveraging verifier models to optimize resource use in large language models during test time by dynamically allocating computation based on local difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in resource allocation during test-time scaling of large language models where computation is uniformly applied without considering the complexity of instances.

Method: LATTS uses a verifier model to dynamically decide, at each generation step, whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop based on a calculated local difficulty criterion.

Result: Empirical results indicate that LATTS achieves better accuracy-to-compute tradeoffs when compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: LATTS introduces a more resource-efficient approach to test-time scaling, improving performance and computational efficiency by adapting to the complexity of individual instances.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

### [3] [Philosophy-informed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20370)
*MZ Naser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML), integrating philosophical concepts into ML models for enhanced alignment, ethical design, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the potential to develop machine learning models that inherently respect philosophical values and address safety, ethical, and governance challenges in ML systems.

Method: The authors propose infusing philosophical principles into ML through model architecture design, objectives, evaluation protocols, and as a post-hoc tool, supported by case studies.

Result: The study demonstrates the practicality and impact of incorporating PhIML into ML and provides insights into existing technical and philosophical challenges.

Conclusion: Integrating philosophy into ML can lead to safer, ethically responsible, and philosophy-aligned machine learning systems, although challenges remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from
analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and
alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can
adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML
model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

*Paris Koloveas,Serafeim Chatzopoulos,Thanasis Vergoulis,Christos Tryfonopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InsightGUIDE is an AI tool that offers concise, structured insights from research papers to assist researchers rather than replace original reading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of scientific literature poses challenges for researchers, as existing tools often provide overly verbose summaries.

Method: The paper introduces InsightGUIDE, which integrates an expert's reading methodology into its AI logic, with its architecture and prompt-driven processes detailed and qualitatively compared to a general-purpose LLM.

Result: InsightGUIDE offers more structured and actionable insights compared to general-purpose LLMs, as demonstrated in a qualitative case study.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE is an effective assistant for researchers, offering concise and structured reading assistance without supplanting engagement with the original material.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [5] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to dynamically validate and assemble time-triggered system schedules, addressing challenges like message collisions and incorrect precedence handling to ensure safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability, safety, and adaptability of time-triggered systems in dynamic environments, addressing challenges such as message collisions, precedence errors, and invalid schedules.

Method: The authors propose a reconstruction framework that transforms AI-derived or heuristic scheduling priorities into executable schedules, incorporating safety checks, efficient resource allocation, and recovery mechanisms for context events.

Result: The results showcase improved system adaptability, operational integrity, and runtime performance, validated through experiments across diverse profiles like makespan reduction, workload balancing, and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical and scalable solution for generating reliable and flexible schedules in dynamic and safety-critical time-triggered systems.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [6] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles limitations of offline AI scheduling by introducing an adaptive online learning approach via reinforcement learning to improve performance in real-time for dynamic, unpredictable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline training for AI scheduling is limited by the infeasibility of creating complete Multi-Schedule Graphs (MSGs) for all scenarios, especially under unpredictable contexts.

Method: They propose integrating an online learning unit with reinforcement learning (RL) into the metascheduler to dynamically explore and expand scheduling solutions.

Result: Several RL models are successfully implemented to improve scheduling solutions, refine existing schedulers, and adapt to stricter deadlines and new performance criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed system ensures robustness, efficiency, and adaptability in handling scheduling demands for safety-critical environments, overcoming offline training limitations.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [7] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel recognition system for EMG-controlled prosthetic hands, using a fuzzy model to counter biosignal contamination through OCC and KNN classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contaminated biosignals reduce classification quality, hindering the effectiveness of EMG-based prosthetic hand control.

Method: The authors developed a system combining an ensemble of one-class classifiers (OCC) for contamination detection and K-nearest neighbours (KNN) for intent recognition, integrated with a fuzzy decision-making model.

Result: Experimental evaluation with real biosignals demonstrated the method's performance, providing comparative analysis with parameters of the system and benchmarking against similar systems.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system improves EMG-based hand prosthesis control by successfully handling contaminated signals, outperforming similar existing systems.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [8] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMULE, a framework for improving LLM agents' reflection generation by using a multi-level synthesis approach for self-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and overreliance on rare successful trajectories, particularly in complex tasks.

Method: SAMULE uses Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis across three levels: micro (single-task error correction), meso (error taxonomies within a task), and macro (insights from diverse tasks). A fine-tuned retrospective language model generates reflections, and foresight-based reflection allows proactive error handling during interactions.

Result: The SAMULE framework achieves superior performance compared to reflection-based baselines on three benchmarks: TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench.

Conclusion: Reflection synthesis and failure-focused learning are critical for developing self-learning capabilities in LLM agents, as demonstrated by the SAMULE framework's success.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional cybersecurity models, specifically scalability, real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in modern ecosystems.

Method: The framework uses agentic AI for autonomous threat mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and anomaly detection, integrating features like behavioral baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence sharing.

Result: Demonstrated improved adaptability, reduced response times, and better detection capabilities, especially against zero-day attacks, through cloud-based simulations.

Conclusion: An intelligent and scalable cybersecurity architecture paradigm compatible with zero-trust models, offering enhanced protection for complex infrastructure and adherence to international cybersecurity standards.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

### [10] [Accelerate Creation of Product Claims Using Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20652)
*Po-Yu Liang,Yong Zhang,Tatiana Hwa,Aaron Byers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Claim Advisor, a web application that uses large language models to accelerate and optimize the creation of product claims, enhancing efficiency in consumer behavior-driven marketing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the creation of effective product claims faster, more cost-efficient, and responsive to consumer needs.

Method: Developed Claim Advisor using in-context learning and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It provides search, generation, optimization, and ranking of product claims through a combination of semantic search and simulations.

Result: The application showed very promising results in a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) context, proving its potential for broad utility across industries.

Conclusion: Claim Advisor is innovative in transforming how claims are developed and tested, demonstrating usefulness in marketing and opening avenues for generative AI applications in multiple industries.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using LLaMA-4 109B for automated and protocol-aware evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans, achieving highly accurate and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the need for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans to ensure transparency, scalability, and robust clinical assessment.

Method: The study curated a dataset of 614 plans, developed a knowledge base, and integrated retrieval, prediction, and constraint-checking modules optimized with Gaussian Process. The pipeline uses a large language model for structured reasoning.

Result: The system achieved perfect accuracy in near-neighbor retrieval and high reliability in end-to-end evaluation, confirming accurate execution of components across protocols.

Conclusion: The RAG system demonstrates feasibility for transparent and scalable radiotherapy plan evaluation while minimizing hallucination. Future work involves clinician validation and improved domain-adapted retrieval models.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

### [12] [Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based Multi-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20729)
*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fairy, a new interactive multi-agent mobile assistant overcoming current limitations in mobile GUI agents by enabling cross-app collaboration, interactive task execution, and continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents struggle with diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs, failing on less common apps and offering poor user experiences due to unilateral task execution.

Method: Fairy consists of three core modules: a Global Task Planner for task decomposition across apps, an App-Level Executor for precise task execution with user interaction, and a Self-Learner for evolving app knowledge through experience.

Result: Fairy, with a GPT-4o backbone, achieved a 33.7% improvement in user requirement completion and a 58.5% reduction in redundant steps, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA).

Conclusion: Fairy's design and interaction mechanisms effectively improve user experience and efficiency, providing a significant advancement in mobile GUI agents.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [13] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Auto-Regressive (AR) and Non-Autoregressive (NAR) language models to enhance reasoning tasks, achieving substantial speedups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models are effective but slow in reasoning tasks, while NAR models are faster but produce less coherent results. The paper aims to integrate their strengths to overcome these challenges.

Method: The approach involves using NAR models to efficiently generate intermediate reasoning traces that guide AR models for producing accurate final answers.

Result: The hybrid approach improves performance by 26% over strong baselines and reduces inference costs.

Conclusion: Combining NAR and AR models in a reasoning framework achieves a balance between speed and quality, demonstrating significant advancements in reasoning-intensive domains.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

### [14] [Meta-Memory: Retrieving and Integrating Semantic-Spatial Memories for Robot Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20754)
*Yufan Mao,Hanjing Ye,Wenlong Dong,Chengjie Zhang,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Memory enables robots to use high-density memory for efficient spatial reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often face challenges in effectively using memories to answer human queries about spatial locations within complex environments.

Method: Meta-Memory utilizes a large language model (LLM) to create dense memory representations and integrates semantic and spatial modalities for reasoning.

Result: Meta-Memory outperformed existing approaches on SpaceLocQA and NaVQA benchmarks, and was successfully deployed on real-world robots.

Conclusion: The approach showcases significant improvement in spatial reasoning for robots, proving its efficacy and practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

### [15] [LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Log Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20798)
*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogReasoner, a framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) to conduct log analysis tasks with a structured reasoning approach inspired by expert cognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of general-purpose LLMs, which struggle to replicate expert-like structured reasoning and deliver precise reasoning details in log analysis tasks.

Method: LogReasoner employs a two-stage framework: (1) Coarse-grained enhancement, which uses expert thinking models to build structured reasoning workflows, and (2) Fine-grained enhancement, involving fine-tuning and preference learning to improve reasoning granularities and accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly improves the reasoning performance of LLMs on four distinct log analysis tasks using models like Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes.

Conclusion: LogReasoner effectively improves LLMs' structured reasoning abilities and performance in log analysis tasks, demonstrating its practical applicability in complex system health monitoring and diagnosis.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

### [16] [DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20912)
*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that enhances answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness in multimodal language models using innovative training paradigms and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models often rely on irrelevant image regions or dataset biases to arrive at answers, leading to flawed reasoning even when answers are correct. This undermines the fidelity of reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Method: DeFacto employs three training paradigms—positive, counterfactual, and random-masking—supported by a novel dataset of 100k images. Additionally, reinforcement learning with GRPO-based rewards steers the model toward accuracy and interpretability.

Result: DeFacto improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness on various benchmarks, marking significant progress in interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework addresses reasoning flaws in multimodal models, combining new training paradigms and RL techniques with a robust dataset to enhance both reasoning and accuracy. Resources (code and dataset) are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

### [17] [GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935)
*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces "GALAX," a framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance disease-critical signaling pathway interpretation by integrating multi-omic data, graph structures, and textual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for precision medicine struggle to combine quantitative multi-omic data, topological graph context, and textual biological knowledge effectively, leading to gaps in mechanistic interpretability and reliable reasoning.

Method: GALAX integrates pretrained GNNs into LLMs using reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), facilitating a step-wise generation and evaluation of disease-relevant subgraphs.

Result: The framework provides process-level supervision for reasoning without intermediate annotations and introduces Target-QA, a benchmark leveraging CRISPR-target data and multi-omic profiles for graph construction relevant to cancer cell lines.

Conclusion: GALAX provides a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable and interpretable reasoning, enabling reliable discovery of disease-related targets and pathways in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

### [18] [Beyond Stars: Bridging the Gap Between Ratings and Review Sentiment with LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20953)
*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular LLM-based framework for analyzing mobile app reviews, addressing limitations of traditional star-rating systems and enhancing sentiment analysis with structured methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Star-rating systems and traditional NLP techniques often fail to accurately interpret nuanced, contextual, and domain-specific feedback from app review texts.

Method: The authors propose a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) with structured prompting for tasks such as quantifying rating-text discrepancies, feature-level analysis, and enabling retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Experiments on the AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify datasets showed that the LLM-based framework outperformed traditional methods in accuracy, robustness, and generating actionable insights.

Conclusion: The modular LLM framework effectively addresses the challenges of app review analysis, providing richer insights and more precise sentiment interpretation compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

### [19] [AOT*: Efficient Synthesis Planning via LLM-Empowered AND-OR Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20988)
*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AOT*, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with AND-OR tree search for efficient retrosynthesis planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning for complex molecules is computationally challenging due to large search spaces and inference costs, and applying LLMs in this domain faces efficiency and cost limitations.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search, utilizing reward assignment strategies and retrieval-based context engineering to streamline chemical space navigation.

Result: Experimental evaluations show AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance, using 3-5 fewer iterations compared to existing LLM-based approaches, especially for complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: AOT* substantially enhances the efficiency of retrosynthesis planning while maintaining competitive solution rates, making it suitable for complex chemical targets.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

*Panagiotis Michelakis,Yiannis Hadjiyiannis,Dimitrios Stamoulis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating AI agents performing real-world tasks and proposes a framework utilizing deterministic finite automata (DFAs) for detailed task assessment through multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for AI agent evaluation overly simplify assessments by focusing on binary outcomes (success or failure), neglecting nuanced factors like safety, intermediate correctness, and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a DFA-based framework to encode tasks as valid sequences of tool-use paths and introduce CORE, a suite of five metrics to measure agent performance comprehensively.

Result: Using the proposed methodology, the authors highlight significant agent performance differences across various scenarios that traditional evaluation approaches fail to capture.

Conclusion: The DFA-based framework and CORE metrics provide a more robust and detailed approach for evaluating AI agents in real-world contexts, addressing the inadequacies of final-state evaluations.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a novel benchmark for assessing long-context reasoning in large language models through complex questions derived from scientific articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings in current long-context benchmarks, such as reliance on non-scientific texts, focus on simple tasks, or use of artificial contexts, by creating a benchmark that tests reasoning using scientific articles.

Method: SciTrek generates questions and answers based on SQL queries over metadata from scientific articles (titles, authors, references), ensuring scalability and verifiable reasoning steps. It evaluates models on contexts up to 1M tokens.

Result: Experiments show that SciTrek challenges large language models, revealing weaknesses in numerical reasoning and locating information in extended contexts. Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning provide limited improvements.

Conclusion: SciTrek highlights significant gaps in the ability of current LLMs to perform long-context reasoning, emphasizing the need for advancements in these systems to handle complex tasks effectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE, a framework for knowledge graph-based multi-hop question answering, optimizes answers by balancing accuracy, latency, and cost while maintaining provenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and unpredictability caused by traditional static k-hop expansions and over-retrieval in multi-hop question answering systems using knowledge graphs.

Method: Introducing CLAUSE, a neuro-symbolic framework with three agents (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator), and implementing an LC-MAPPO algorithm to optimize decisions under resource budgets during context construction.

Result: CLAUSE outperforms in terms of EM@1, latency, and token efficiency over benchmarks like HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, with significant gains in MetaQA-2-hop over GraphRAG by improving accuracy while reducing latency and graph expansion.

Conclusion: CLAUSE provides a compact and efficient framework for knowledge graph reasoning, enabling predictable and cost-effective question answering under deployment constraints.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate the creative abilities of large language models (LLMs) based on novelty and utility, revealing limitations and insights into their creative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of frameworks for evaluating the open-ended creative abilities of AI systems, particularly large language models, beyond compositional generalization.

Method: The authors propose a framework for evaluating the outputs of LLMs by their novelty and utility, and empirically investigate the scaling behavior, optimum configurations, and tradeoffs in LLM creativity.

Result: They discover optimal configurations for LLM creativity, highlight a fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff, and note that this tradeoff limits long-term creative potential despite scaling.

Conclusion: The findings provide foundational insights and challenge existing assumptions about the creative capabilities of LLMs, suggesting the need for advancements to overcome inherent tradeoffs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates persuasion dynamics within Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) involving Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). It shifts focus from model size to cognitive processes, introducing the concept of 'Persuasion Duality' that balances resistance to persuasion and persuasive efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to challenge the assumption that model scale determines persuasive efficacy, focusing instead on cognitive processes to provide insights into persuasion dynamics critical for MAS design and safety.

Method: The authors conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments, analyzing how LRMs' reasoning processes resist persuasion while their transparent reasoning enhances their ability to persuade others. Additionally, they explored multi-hop persuasion scenarios in MAS networks.

Result: The research identified 'Persuasion Duality,' a trade-off where LRMs are robust against persuasion while excelling in persuading others through reasoning transparency. They also uncovered complex influence propagation dynamics in MAS networks.

Conclusion: The findings link internal cognitive processes to persuasive behaviors in MAS, offering valuable insights for the future design and safety of MAS, and addressing vulnerabilities in advanced persuasion systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces Recon-Act, a multi-agent framework designed to improve task-solving on complex web interactions, utilizing closed-loop learning through reconnaissance and action. It achieves significant advancements on the VisualWebArena dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current web-interaction agents that struggle with disordered actions and excessive trial-and-error in long-horizon tasks.

Method: The framework employs two teams: a Reconnaissance Team to analyze errors and generate tools, and an Action Team to execute tasks using these tools, all within a closed-loop pipeline.

Result: Recon-Act demonstrates improved adaptability to new websites and better performance on long-duration tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the VisualWebArena dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes prior challenges in web interactions by leveraging self-evolving tools and collaborative team dynamics, presenting a promising roadmap towards full automation.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses two evaluation inconsistencies in LLMs used as automated evaluators through a probabilistic framework called TrustJudge, which significantly improves evaluation accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical issues in the evaluation frameworks of LLMs as judges, focusing on inconsistencies like score-comparison errors and transitivity violations.

Method: Proposed TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework with two innovations: distribution-sensitive scoring to preserve information and likelihood-aware aggregation to resolve transitivity issues.

Result: TrustJudge reduced Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%, improving evaluation reliability without extra training or human annotations.

Conclusion: TrustJudge offers systematic insights and practical solutions, ensuring trustworthy LLM evaluation frameworks with consistent improvements across models and scales.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a refined method to enhance reasoning capabilities in large models using Chain-of-thought (CoT) data through efficient selection based on high-value reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices in training large reasoning models indiscriminately use CoT data, raising questions about its effectiveness in improving reasoning. The paper aims to optimize the use of CoT data to enhance reasoning abilities.

Method: Defining reasoning potential as inversely proportional to the attempts required for a correct answer. Abstracting atomic reasoning patterns and building a core reference set enriched with these patterns. Introducing a dual-granularity algorithm to efficiently select CoT data that aligns with this core set for model training.

Result: Using just 10B-token CoT data, the proposed 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model achieved a 9.58% improvement on AIME 2024 and 2025 tasks, and boosted downstream RL performance upper bound by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Efficient selection of reasoning data based on high-value reasoning patterns is an effective approach to training models for improved reasoning capabilities, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) shape language models' reasoning abilities, revealing complementary effects: RL focuses reasoning while SFT diversifies it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct and combined effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), beyond their overall accuracy improvement.

Method: The reasoning process is analyzed at trajectory-level (complete reasoning outputs) and step-level (reasoning graphs based on individual steps), with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters, and techniques like clustering and graph-effect analysis.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories, concentrating reasoning into a smaller subset of steps, while SFT expands correct trajectories, homogenizing reasoning across multiple steps. Quantitative changes in reasoning graph topologies are also identified.

Conclusion: The combined use of SFT and RL in a two-stage training process is effective because SFT expands reasoning versatility, and RL consolidates reasoning efficiency, providing guidance for future training strategies and dataset design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

### [29] [ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134)
*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ToMPO algorithm for improving strategic decision-making in LLMs, addressing their limitations in reasoning about others and interdependent decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current reinforcement learning methods and LLMs in considering others' strategies and temporal dependencies in decision-making.

Method: The paper defines a strategic decision-making problem and proposes the ToMPO algorithm, which excels in perceiving individual strategies and analyzing game trends through advanced features such as reasoning-based rollouts and multi-level advantage estimation.

Result: The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in compliance and cooperative outcomes and exceeds models with 100x more parameters by 18%.

Conclusion: ToMPO significantly enhances the strategic decision-making abilities of LLMs, offering a more effective and efficient solution than existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

### [30] [Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21136)
*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model inspired by mirror neurons that aligns representations of observed and executed actions to enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between action understanding and embodied execution, which are inherently connected but often modeled separately in machine learning.

Method: The method employs two linear layers to map observed and executed representations into a shared latent space, using contrastive learning to align them and maximize mutual information.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the approach improves representation quality and generalization by fostering mutual synergy between action understanding and execution tasks.

Conclusion: The study validates that aligning representations inspired by mirror neuron mechanisms enhances task performance, showing the interconnectedness of observation and execution.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

### [31] [Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21163)
*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models handle rare tokens via distributed subnetworks rather than modular architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in representing and generating rare tokens in large language models.

Method: Analyze neurons in final-layer MLPs of various model families to evaluate rare-token processing mechanisms.

Result: Rare-token processing occurs via a distributed specialization mechanism involving coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks.

Conclusion: Rare-token handling follows a distributed structure, aiding insights for interpretable LLM edits and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [32] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) for large language models (LLMs), introducing theoretical limits and proposing a novel multi-step reasoning framework, InfoQA, that improves accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHQA requires sequential reasoning across dispersed evidence, but LLMs struggle when task complexity exceeds their single-pass output capacity. This research aims to overcome this bottleneck by investigating accuracy limits and proposing solutions.

Method: The authors establish a Fano-style accuracy upper bound to identify performance ceilings and introduce a multi-call framework, InfoQA, which uses capacity-aware task decomposition and reasoning path control to avoid overflow issues.

Result: Experimental validation shows that InfoQA effectively manages reasoning complexity and surpasses single-pass accuracy boundaries. The model behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions under stringent conditions.

Conclusion: InfoQA showcases a promising multi-step reasoning method for MHQA tasks, providing insights into capacity-aware reasoning for LLMs and encouraging further advancements in multi-step reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

### [33] [What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21224)
*Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture to study unprompted behavior in large language model agents, identifying three distinctive patterns of activity across different model implementations through systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how large language models behave autonomously without external tasks and establish a baseline for understanding their natural tendencies and biases.

Method: The authors used a continuous reason-and-act framework with persistent memory and self-feedback, deploying it across 18 runs with six state-of-the-art models from major AI labs.

Result: Three emergent behavioral patterns are identified: (1) project creation, (2) cognitive self-analysis, and (3) recursive self-conceptualization. Some models consistently followed specific patterns, showing stable biases.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the spontaneous and model-specific nature of LLM behavior, creating foundational insights for deploying autonomous systems and addressing potential ambiguities or errors.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

*Zijian Shao,Haiyang Shen,Mugeng Liu,Gecheng Fu,Yaoqi Guo,Yanfeng Wang,Yun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) that balances accurate disease prediction with clear, meaningful explanations, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of existing machine learning and LLM-based models, which struggle to provide both high prediction accuracy and clinically meaningful, trustworthy explanations.

Method: The Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) involves coordinating multiple LLMs, featuring iterative rule refinement from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rule check to incorporate global dataset statistics.

Result: RCA outperformed 22 baselines on one private and two public datasets, showing up to 40% relative improvement in accuracy and generating high-quality explanations that are clear, evidence-based, and balanced.

Conclusion: The RCA framework demonstrates significant potential for trustworthy clinical decision support systems by developing deep data comprehension and combining it with high predictive accuracy and robust explanations.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VC-Agent, an interactive tool using multi-modal large language models for personalized video dataset collection with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting extensive, specific video datasets from the internet is labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The VC-Agent employs multi-modal large language models to link user requirements with video content, alongside novel user-friendly filtering policies for iterative refinement through interaction.

Result: Experiments and user studies demonstrate VC-Agent's effectiveness and efficiency in retrieving and scaling up video datasets tailored to users' needs.

Conclusion: VC-Agent streamlines video dataset collection through an interactive interface, offering a novel, efficient approach to personalized dataset development.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a benchmark for assessing semantic understanding of embedding models and similarity metrics, which exposes performance gaps and limitations in semantic tasks across 30+ datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a challenging evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional benchmarks to probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding in large language models.

Method: The authors designed SAGE as a benchmark evaluating embedding models and similarity metrics across five key dimensions: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness, using adversarial conditions and nuanced human judgment tasks.

Result: SAGE evaluated 9 embedding models and classical metrics, revealing performance gaps; no single approach excelled across all dimensions. For example, OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large performed best in human preference alignment but was surpassed by classical metrics in information sensitivity.

Conclusion: SAGE highlights critical trade-offs and gaps in semantic understanding capabilities, providing a realistic tool to assess model robustness and suitability for real-world applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on open-source RISC-V implementation for educational use by proposing evaluation criteria, assessing existing implementations, and creating a robust open-source framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an open-source, adaptable RISC-V implementation for educational and amateur use, addressing the restrictive nature of commercial ISAs.

Method: Evaluate RISC-V implementations against pedagogical criteria, and develop an open-source framework meeting these benchmarks, ensuring composability for diverse educational needs.

Result: A comprehensive open-source RISC-V framework was created fulfilling pedagogical criteria, complemented by preliminary student feedback.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, easy-to-use tool for instructors and students, addressing gaps in open-source RISC-V implementations for education.

Abstract: While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use
through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA
presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many
free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on
platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V
implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZynqParrot, an FPGA-based modeling platform using the Scale-Down approach for accurate, efficient, and economical decomposition of systems for performance and functionality verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processor complexity raises cost and runtime concerns in functional verification and performance validation, particularly in simulation of long workloads.

Method: The paper proposes Scale-Down modeling, decomposing systems into manageable sub-components for prototyping, avoiding interference while ensuring FPGA acceleration and cycle accuracy.

Result: ZynqParrot is a modular, cycle-accurate co-emulation platform evaluated through case studies, demonstrating capabilities in functionality and performance verification with RISC-V processors.

Conclusion: Scale-Down modeling, through ZynqParrot, overcomes the inefficiencies of Scale-Out and Scale-Up approaches, enabling architects to achieve precision in system verification.

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.

*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for shifting public sentiment on diplomatic events by modifying narratives, leveraging a large language model and communication theories, and achieving a 70% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public sentiment is crucial for the effectiveness of diplomatic initiatives, policy support, and international image, but traditional sentiment analysis methods are resource-intensive and lack forward-looking capabilities.

Method: The method involves training a language model to predict public reaction to diplomatic events, creating a dataset of event descriptions and public discussions, predefining textual features for modification based on communication theories, and using a counterfactual generation algorithm with a large language model to alter narratives.

Result: The framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state in 70% of cases.

Conclusion: This framework is a practical tool for diplomats and policymakers to craft narratives that foster positive public sentiment toward diplomatic initiatives.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the predictors of memory load during sentence comprehension, focusing on sentence length, dependency length, and intervening structural complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether memory load in sentence comprehension is better explained by linear distance between dependent words or the structural complexity of the material between them.

Method: Analyzed harmonized dependency treebanks across multiple languages using a mixed-effects model to examine sentence-level memory load predictors, operationalized as a combination of feature misbinding and interference.

Result: All three factors—sentence length, dependency length, and intervening structural complexity—positively influence memory load, with sentence length having the broadest impact and intervening complexity providing additional explanatory power.

Conclusion: The study shows that both linear and hierarchical factors affect memory load, with interveners being a better indicator of processing demands than linear distance, offering a unified approach to evaluating memory load theories.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework using speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring and graph-based clustering for improved cross-lingual speech emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual SER faces challenges due to differences in phonetic variability and expressive styles among speakers and languages, requiring methods to align emotional expressions under diverse conditions.

Method: The proposed framework builds emotion-specific speaker communities using graph-based clustering and applies dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces for improved emotion alignment and transfer.

Result: Evaluations on English and Taiwanese Mandarin datasets show improved generalization compared to competitive baseline models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances cross-lingual emotion recognition and offers insights into the commonalities of emotion representation across different languages.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Conclusion: CFDLLMBench lays a foundation for assessing and improving LLM-driven automation techniques in computational science, particularly for numerical experiments in complex physical systems like CFD.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [43] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses machine learning models' ability to detect AI-generated research texts, finding DistilBERT to have the best performance among evaluated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content like ChatGPT texts poses societal risks in academic integrity, copyright issues, and misinformation, necessitating reliable AI-text detection tools.

Method: The study compared various ML models (classical techniques like Logistic Regression; transformer-based methods like DistilBERT, BERT, LSTM-based models) using labeled data of 250 text pairs to evaluate performance. Ensemble methods were tested.

Result: DistilBERT exhibited superior detection capability. Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom models provided balanced alternatives, while LSTM and BERT-N-gram models performed relatively poorly. Ensembles didn't outperform DistilBERT.

Conclusion: DistilBERT stands out as the top-performing model for detecting AI-generated texts. The research emphasizes improving transformer-based systems with richer datasets to adapt to advancing generative AI technologies.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConceptViz, a system that aids the interpretation of sparse autoencoder features in large language models by aligning them with human-understandable concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models represent knowledge internally is challenging, especially as SAE features are hard to interpret in human terms.

Method: ConceptViz utilizes a three-step pipeline (Identification, Interpretation, Validation) to map SAEs to human-understandable concepts, allowing interactive exploration and verification.

Result: Through usage scenarios and a user study, ConceptViz was effective in enhancing the interpretability and validation of concept representations in language models.

Conclusion: ConceptViz improves interpretability research by making it easier for researchers to discover and validate meaningful feature representations in LLMs, contributing to better understanding and usability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [45] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG proposes leveraging self-knowledge in LLMs to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance by filtering irrelevant content using a reinforcement learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation caused by irrelevant retrieved content. It seeks to filter out this content using a model's self-awareness of its own knowledge.

Method: SKILL-RAG employs a reinforcement learning-based framework to extract self-knowledge from the model and filters retrieved documents at a sentence-level granularity to integrate relevant external knowledge.

Result: Evaluation on benchmarks with Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B shows improved generation quality and reduced input documents, highlighting the value of self-knowledge in enhancing RAG's performance.

Conclusion: SKILL-RAG effectively utilizes self-knowledge for better filtering of retrievals, enhancing the synergy between internal model knowledge and external data sources while mitigating irrelevant information.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM introduces fine-grained emotional control in text-to-speech (TTS) by aligning word-level emotion annotations to text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of existing approaches to capture dynamic emotional shifts within sentences in TTS.

Method: Introduces the Emo-FiLM framework, which uses frame-level emotion2vec features, aligns them to words, and modulates these through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer for fine-grained control.

Result: Emo-FiLM outperforms current approaches in both global and fine-grained emotional expression tasks.

Conclusion: The Emo-FiLM framework is effective and generalizable for creating expressive and emotionally dynamic speech synthesis.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces USB-Rec, a framework to enhance Large Language Models in Conversational Recommender Systems by integrating training and inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of training focus in existing LLM-based approaches for conversational recommendation to improve performance.

Method: They developed the User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec) featuring a Preference Optimization dataset strategy for reinforcement learning training and a Self-Enhancement Strategy for inference.

Result: Experiments show that USB-Rec outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated framework effectively enhances LLMs' capabilities in conversational recommendation, solving key limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Conformal Importance Summarization, a framework ensuring critical content inclusion in AI-generated summaries through conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Summarization systems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and law, struggle to reliably include critical content, posing risks in high-stakes applications.

Method: The proposed framework calibrates thresholds on sentence-level importance using conformal prediction to generate summaries with user-specified coverage and recall of critical content.

Result: Experiments on summarization benchmarks confirm that the method ensures a theoretically guaranteed information coverage rate while being model-agnostic and requiring only minimal calibration.

Conclusion: The framework offers a controllable, reliable approach to automatic summarization, enabling safer AI deployment in critical domains by ensuring critical content is preserved.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object

### [50] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS is a role-based collaboration framework that improves reasoning among language models while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to Multi-Agent Debate (MAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the reasoning limitations of large language models operating as single agents and addresses the computational inefficiencies in collaborative reasoning frameworks like MAD.

Method: MARS employs a role-based system where an author generates initial solutions, reviewers independently offer feedback, and a meta-reviewer synthesizes this feedback to guide final decision-making.

Result: Experiments show that MARS achieves similar accuracy to MAD but with approximately 50% reductions in token usage and inference time.

Conclusion: MARS offers an efficient and accurate alternative to MAD, improving reasoning capabilities of LLMs while minimizing resource consumption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SiniticMTError dataset, providing annotated machine-translation errors for English translations into Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu Chinese to aid in improving low-resource language translation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translation for low-resource languages like Cantonese and Wu Chinese remains challenging due to the lack of substantial training data and linguistic resources.

Method: The authors created SiniticMTError by annotating machine-translated outputs for English to Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu Chinese with error type, span, and severity using native speakers. They ensured quality through rigorous analysis and feedback loops.

Result: The dataset helps identify patterns in types and severity of errors for machine translations, offering insights into improving translation models for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError provides a valuable resource for improving machine translation quality, fostering research on error-aware generation and evaluation for languages with fewer linguistic resources.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwasthLLM, a zero-shot, cross-lingual framework for medical diagnosis in English, Hindi, and Bengali, addressing challenges in low-resource languages with 97.22% accuracy in supervised settings and strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of automatic disease diagnosis from clinical text in multilingual healthcare environments, particularly focusing on low-resource languages like Hindi and Bengali.

Method: SwasthLLM combines the XLM-RoBERTa encoder, a language-aware attention mechanism, a contrastive learning module, a translation consistency module, and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) for cross-lingual, multi-task medical diagnostic capabilities.

Result: SwasthLLM achieved a test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings, and in zero-shot evaluations, achieved 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% on Bengali.

Conclusion: SwasthLLM demonstrates effective multilingual diagnostic performance, particularly in low-resource languages, and highlights the framework's robustness, zero-shot capabilities, and potential for multilingual healthcare settings.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DS-MoE, an adaptive modular framework extending the Mixture of Experts paradigm to specialize processing depths for different reasoning complexities, achieving improved efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability in large-scale transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional transformer architectures uniformly apply the same processing depth to all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality, particularly for complex inference tasks.

Method: The paper proposes DS-MoE, a modular framework with depth-specialised expert modules optimized for various reasoning depths. A learned routing network dynamically assembles reasoning chains, activating only the necessary experts based on input complexity.

Result: DS-MoE achieves up to 16% computational savings, 35% faster inference, and 2.8% higher accuracy on complex benchmarks compared to standard transformers, while also yielding interpretable reasoning chains.

Conclusion: DS-MoE represents a substantial improvement in adaptive neural architectures by enhancing efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability through depth-specialised modular processing.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), which processes text hierarchically rather than sequentially, thus improving computational efficiency and language understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers misrepresent human language as flat token sequences, leading to inefficiency, poor compositional generalization, and weak discourse-level modeling.

Method: HRT uses a wavelet-inspired, multi-resolution processing approach to enable bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization. It reduces sequence lengths exponentially, achieving O(nlogn) complexity.

Result: HRT demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE (+3.8%), SuperGLUE (+4.5%), and Long Range Arena (+6.1%), while reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37%.

Conclusion: HRT aligns computational architecture with the hierarchical structure of human language, providing both efficiency gains and improved language understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM enhances the speed of discrete flow-matching for language generation, reducing sampling steps from thousands to only a few while maintaining high output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of existing language models, such as ARMs, which generate tokens serially, causing latency issues, and DLMs, which require numerous sampling steps for high quality outputs.

Method: FS-DFM incorporates a discrete flow-matching approach where the number of sampling steps is an explicit parameter. The model is trained for consistency across step budgets with guidance distilled from lengthy trajectories and a reliable update rule to ensure accuracy without overshooting.

Result: The proposed FS-DFM achieves perplexity parity with a discrete-flow baseline, requiring only 8 steps compared to 1,024. It provides up to 128 times faster sampling with significant improvements in latency and throughput.

Conclusion: FS-DFM demonstrates that discrete flow-matching can be optimized for fewer steps without compromising quality, offering a practical solution for fast and efficient language modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of performance forecasting for language models using redacted task descriptions, aiming to predict outcomes without running experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evaluation process of large language models often consumes significant resources, so the authors propose forecasting performance to optimize and prioritize experiments.

Method: The authors use a corpus called PRECOG consisting of redacted description-performance pairs, implement experiments with retrieval modules, examine model reasoning behaviors, and test forecasting abilities under zero-leakage settings.

Result: Models achieve moderate prediction accuracy, with errors as low as 8.7 on accuracy-related tasks. Stronger reasoning models exhibit diverse querying, while open-source ones show limitations.

Conclusion: The study highlights that forecasting performance is feasible and could aid experiment prioritization, although improvements in reasoning and retrieval are needed for better accuracy.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

### [57] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to improve Japanese speech recognition tasks by addressing data sparsity with multitask learning and fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for tailored speech recognizers arises due to limited data for training models that produce phonemic transcriptions with accent marks, important for Japanese speaking assessment tasks.

Method: The paper proposes multitask training to incorporate auxiliary loss functions for leveraging orthographic annotations and fusion using finite-state transducer-based algorithms to combine phonetic and text estimates.

Result: The suggested methods reduced mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% on the CSJ core evaluation sets, demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: Multitask learning and fusion are effective strategies for building accurate phonemic recognizers, outperforming generic multilingual recognizers and showcasing advantages for Japanese speech assessment tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

### [58] [Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction with Knowledge from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20664)
*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework combining knowledge extracted from large language models (LLMs) with molecular structure features to enhance molecular property prediction (MPP), surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve molecular property prediction (MPP), a critical step in drug discovery, by addressing limitations in current methods that either rely heavily on manual feature engineering or have knowledge gaps and hallucinations in advanced models like LLMs.

Method: The proposed framework integrates prior knowledge extracted from LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1) with structural features obtained from pre-trained molecular models. It uses LLMs to generate domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, which is fused with structural representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the integrated approach outperforms existing MPP techniques, leveraging the combined strengths of LLM-derived knowledge and molecular structural features.

Conclusion: Fusing LLM-extracted knowledge with pre-trained molecular structural features offers a robust and effective strategy for improving molecular property prediction, advancing the field of drug discovery.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

### [59] [RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20691)
*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new adversarial attack, RedHerring, which reduces the reliability of attack detection models for text while maintaining classifier accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding the reliability of attack detection models, which are crucial for identifying adversarial modifications in text for NLP applications.

Method: The authors propose and test the RedHerring attack, which manipulates text to decrease the accuracy of attack detection models while leaving classifier accuracy intact.

Result: RedHerring decreased detection accuracy by 20-71 percentage points across 4 datasets and 3 detectors while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The research highlights vulnerabilities in attack detection models and offers a simple initial defense based on a confidence check, which significantly improves detection accuracy without retraining models.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

### [60] [Overcoming Black-box Attack Inefficiency with Hybrid and Dynamic Select Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20699)
*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in adversarial text attack testing by introducing two new strategies, Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which reduce computational costs while maintaining attack efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational cost of adversarial text attacks on complex NLP models, making such testing accessible to researchers with limited resources.

Method: The authors propose two innovative attack selection strategies—Hybrid Select, which uses a size threshold to combine BinarySelect and GreedySelect techniques, and Dynamic Select, which learns to allocate binary and greedy approaches based on text lengths.

Result: The sentence-level Hybrid Select method successfully reduces query requirements for adversarial attacks by 25.82% on average across various datasets and models without compromising attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies significantly improve the query efficiency of adversarial attacks, offering practical solutions for researchers constrained by computational resources.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the adaptability of speech emotion recognition by training a student model that surpasses API-only LALMs using unlabeled target-domain audio and auxiliary teacher frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech emotion recognition (SER) struggles with domain mismatch, particularly in scenarios where source data are unavailable, and accessible large audio-language models are limited to APIs.

Method: The paper introduces MI-Fuse, a framework combining stochastic predictions of a source-domain-trained SER classifier and an API-only LALM. The predictions are weighted using mutual-information-based uncertainty and stabilized with an exponential moving average teacher.

Result: Experiments conducted across three emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent improvements where the student model surpasses the LALM and outperforms strong baselines by 3.9%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a solution for adapting SER systems to new domains without access to source data, showcasing its practicality and effectiveness for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

*Jinwook Park,Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses a core issue in unsupervised neural grammar induction called 'probability distribution collapse.' A new methodology, 'collapse-relaxing neural parameterization,' mitigates it and enhances parsing performance with more compact grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the expressiveness bottleneck in existing models for unsupervised neural grammar induction, which leads to overly large and underperforming grammar structures.

Method: The authors propose 'collapse-relaxing neural parameterization,' which prevents collapse in the probability distribution of neural grammar models.

Result: The approach significantly improves grammar parsing performance and achieves more compact grammar structures across various languages.

Conclusion: By addressing probability distribution collapse, the proposed method makes grammar learning models more efficient and interpretable, yielding both tighter and better-performing grammars.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

*Youwon Jang,Woo Suk Choi,Minjoon Jung,Minsu Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces C2R, a novel framework for question-answering tasks that refines answers using confidence scores from sub-questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and performance of question-answering models across text, image, and video domains, utilizing sub-question reasoning.

Method: C2R generates and refines sub-questions to assess their respective confidence scores, selecting the best answer based on score comparisons, integrating seamlessly into existing QA models without additional training.

Result: The framework enhances performance consistently across varied QA models and benchmarks, and provides insights into the role of sub-questions in reasoning processes.

Conclusion: C2R effectively advances QA systems through confidence-based refinement without requiring extra training, emphasizing the importance of quality and quantity of sub-questions in reasoning.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the trade-off in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). It highlights that SFT may not always harm general capabilities, particularly with smaller learning rates, and introduces the Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) method to improve this balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the belief that domain-specific Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of LLMs inevitably degrades their general capabilities and investigate better strategies to mitigate such trade-offs.

Method: The study explores the impact of smaller learning rates and presents the new Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) method. It uses experimental evaluation and theoretical analysis while comparing existing strategies such as L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, and FLOW.

Result: Experimental results show that TALR outperforms other strategies in maintaining a balance between domain-specific fine-tuning benefits and general performance retention, while no method completely eliminates the trade-off.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical guidelines for adapting LLMs: use small learning rates to minimize performance degradation and employ TALR when further optimization is needed for balancing domain-specific and general capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

### [65] [Towards Atoms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784)
*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Atoms Theory for understanding internal representations in large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations of existing units like neurons and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to define fundamental units for internal representations in LLMs, overcoming issues like polysemy in neurons and instability in features.

Method: The Atoms Theory is proposed with the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations are used to validate the theory through theoretical and experimental results.

Result: The study finds that atoms enable 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers and provide significantly better uniqueness conditions compared to neurons (0.5%) and features (68.2%). Scaling experiments also confirm the recovery capacity of SAEs.

Conclusion: The Atoms Theory offers a theoretical framework for understanding LLM representations, demonstrating its potential for stable and unique sparse modeling while addressing limitations of previous units.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [66] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Conversational Prompting" methods that leverage user reviews as conversational inputs for generating personalized reviews using large language models (LLMs) in few-shot, training-free settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating personalized reviews when there is limited data about the target user and no opportunity to fine-tune models.

Method: They propose two methods: (1) Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP), which uses only the target user's reviews reformulated as conversational turns, and (2) Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), which introduces incorrect replies to guide the model in producing text resembling the user's style.

Result: Experiments on multiple domains and LLMs demonstrated that SCP and CCP outperform traditional prompting methods in generating personalized reviews closely mimicking the user's style, even in low-resource conditions where only two user reviews were available.

Conclusion: Conversational prompting is a lightweight and efficient solution for generating personalized reviews under few-shot and training-free constraints, with CCP being more effective if high-quality negative examples are available.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) framework to address the semantic gap between structured KGs and unstructured queries in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges like hallucinations and factual errors when handling knowledge-intensive tasks due to the semantic disparity between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries.

Method: The proposed EoG framework enriches KGs using LLMs' prior knowledge to improve graph-query alignment. It introduces three graph-quality metrics and verifies optimization objectives theoretically.

Result: Experimental results on two KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate the EoG framework's ability to produce high-quality KGs and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EoG bridges structural and semantic gaps in KGQA tasks, enhances reasoning accuracy, and ensures scalability and adaptability with low computational costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO combines LLMs' overcorrection with fine-tuned small LM precision to balance recall and precision in grammatical error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models excel in precision but lack recall, while large language models have high recall but low precision. This research seeks to combine their strengths.

Method: The approach uses large language models for intentional overcorrection to boost recall, followed by small fine-tuned models for targeted post-correction to improve precision.

Result: Experimental results show that PoCO significantly enhances recall and maintains competitive precision in grammatical error correction tasks.

Conclusion: PoCO successfully combines the strengths of large and small language models, achieving a balanced performance in grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'cheat-sheet ICL,' a method that uses concise textual summaries instead of lengthy examples for in-context learning, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency of in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) due to the high token count required for many-shot examples.

Method: Introduce cheat-sheet ICL, which distills many-shot examples into a concise textual summary used as context during inference.

Result: Cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or better performance than traditional many-shot ICL with fewer tokens and performs on par with retrieval-based ICL without the need for retrieval.

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL is an effective and efficient alternative for utilizing LLMs in downstream reasoning tasks, combining ease of use and strong performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper stems from privacy concerns when using LLMs in cloud services, where user data may inadvertently expose sensitive information.

Method: The paper proposes a zero-shot iterative sentence rewriting algorithm utilizing tree-search guided by a reward model to obfuscate or delete private information while maintaining text quality.

Result: Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in balancing privacy and utility.

Conclusion: The presented approach offers a promising and effective mechanism for mitigating privacy risks in text data, achieving superior anonymization while preserving text naturalness and relevance.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Conclusion: Sub-sentence citations improve verification efficiency for users and overcome limitations in traditional sentence and paragraph-level attribution.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [72] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes WeFT, a weighted supervised fine-tuning method for diffusion-based language models, achieving significant improvements in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in language tasks show promise but have challenges in supervised fine-tuning due to inconsistent generation and lack of precise probability estimates.

Method: Introduces WeFT, a weighted supervised fine-tuning technique that adjusts token importance based on their entropy to improve consistency in generation.

Result: WeFT achieved 39%, 64%, and 83% relative improvements over standard supervised fine-tuning on Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500, using small datasets.

Conclusion: WeFT enhances the reasoning performance of diffusion language models by addressing unpredictability in token control, with code and models to be shared publicly.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

### [73] [Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866)
*Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Natpatchara Pongjirapat,Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Tossaporn Saengja,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates approaches for enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions instead of single answers, introducing prompting and fine-tuning methods (SFT and RFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRMs typically produce single answers, which may hinder clinical decision-making that benefits from considering multiple options or perspectives.

Method: The authors propose a ranked-list answer format and explore two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. Fine-tuning includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to mimic annotated responses and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) that uses reward functions targeted at ranked answers.

Result: Ranked-list answers using RFT demonstrate greater robustness across formats than SFT. A case study on modified MedQA showed MRMs recognize multiple valid answers even if they fail to match the benchmark's preferred ground truth.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for using ranked lists as an alternative answer format, which could improve medical decision-making processes by accounting for multiple valid options.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

### [74] [Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic Collaboration for Long Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20900)
*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ proposes an adversarial multi-agent framework to address long document summarization challenges through collaborative summarization and quizzing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current LLMs in summarizing long documents, such as information loss and factual inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces a multi-agent framework with summarization and quizzing agents working collaboratively and adversarially to refine summaries and ensure quality.

Result: SummQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in three benchmarking datasets based on ROUGE, BERTScore, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The adversarial collaboration of summarization and quizzing agents is a promising new approach for improving the quality of long document summaries.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

### [75] [MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20909)
*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens identifies memorization in LLMs by analyzing numeric token trajectory patterns during generation, distinguishing between clean and contaminated examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in detecting implicit memorization contamination in language models.

Method: MemLens analyzes the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation to identify shortcut behaviors associated with contaminated data.

Result: MemLens effectively separates clean and contaminated data based on reasoning trajectory patterns and was validated by injecting specific samples via LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MemLens demonstrates its ability to reliably detect memorization in language models by capturing meaningful signals rather than relying on shallow correlations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [76] [Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20957)
*Asim Ersoy,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar,Kareem Darwish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how to improve tool-calling abilities of Arabic large language models using newly developed datasets and various training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While tool-calling for LLMs is heavily researched in English, there is a scarcity of resources and studies for other languages, such as Arabic, hence the paper seeks to close this gap.

Method: The authors conducted experiments with an Arabic LLM, adapted datasets from English into Arabic, and studied the impact of different strategies such as cross-lingual transfer, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning for specific tools.

Result: Extensive experiments revealed insights into strategies that can enhance the effectiveness and robustness of tool-augmented Arabic LLMs.

Conclusion: Developing Arabic LLMs capable of tool-calling requires a combination of adapted datasets and tailored training approaches to ensure high performance.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

### [77] [Analysis of instruction-based LLMs' capabilities to score and judge text-input problems in an academic setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20982)
*Valeria Ramirez-Garcia,David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators for academic Text-Input Problems, concluding that Reference Aided Evaluation is the most effective method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to determine the efficacy of LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems in higher education, particularly for assessing Text-Input Problems.

Method: The study tested five evaluation systems across a dataset of 110 student answers using three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation delivered the best results, with the most accurate scoring metrics compared to human evaluators.

Conclusion: Automated evaluation systems powered by LLMs hold promise as supplementary tools for academic purposes, provided they are applied with suitable methodologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can efficiently assist with text-heavy workloads in federally funded research contexts, demonstrating their application through case studies like NDAA and NSF Awards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of efficiently processing and analyzing text-heavy documents in federally funded research and governmental contexts, which are traditionally slow when handled manually.

Method: The authors employ large language models (LLMs) combined with the OnPrem$.$LLM framework. This approach uses minimal input-output examples and ensures secure and flexible generative AI application suitable for sensitive government operations.

Result: The study found that applying this method enhances the processing of defense policy and scientific documents, making oversight and strategic analysis more effective while preserving auditability and data sovereignty.

Conclusion: The use of OnPrem$.$LLM with LLMs can significantly accelerate text analysis tasks in sensitive governmental settings, demonstrating potential for broader applications in secure and strategic contexts.

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

### [79] [Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042)
*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how the causal mask in Transformer decoders contributes to positional information, showing it induces position-dependent attention patterns and interacts significantly with explicit encodings like RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the underexplored role of the causal mask in Transformers as a source of positional information, questioning its interaction with explicit encodings like RoPE and the impact on attention scores.

Method: The authors performed theoretical analysis to demonstrate attention pattern tendencies induced by causal masks, followed by empirical analysis on trained models to validate these behaviors and study the interaction between causal masks and RoPE.

Result: The study revealed that causal masks inherently favor nearby query-key pairs, similar to positional encodings, and distort RoPE's attention patterns in large language models.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical role of causal masks as a source of positional information in Transformers, emphasizing the impact of their interaction with explicit encodings like RoPE.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

*Keno Harada,Yudai Yamazaki,Masachika Taniguchi,Edison Marrese-Taylor,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces benchmarks to assess how large language models (LLMs) handle multiple instructions simultaneously, revealing consistent performance degradation with increasing instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs' ability to follow multiple instructions at once in real-world applications where such capabilities are critical.

Method: Created two benchmarks, ManyIFEval and StyleMBPP, along with regression models to estimate performance for unseen instruction combinations and varying instruction counts.

Result: Performance consistently declines as the number of instructions rises; regression models achieve approximately 10% error in predicting performance even for unseen combinations.

Conclusion: Efficient evaluation of LLMs under diverse instruction combinations is achievable using relatively modest sample sizes and predictive models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoM-1K benchmark evaluates foundation models' performance on multimodal strength of materials problems. Models perform poorly with the best achieving 56.6% accuracy, suggesting improved text-based visual descriptions help mitigate errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the performance of foundation models in tackling complex, multimodal engineering problems, a largely unexplored domain, through a specialized dataset.

Method: The authors introduced SoM-1K, a dataset blending textual and schematic information, and an expert-generated prompting strategy (DoI). They assessed eight foundation models using this approach.

Result: Results show foundation models struggle with multimodal engineering tasks. Models using DoI outperform those using visual diagrams, with LLMs achieving better accuracy than VLMs.

Conclusion: Current foundation models require improved multimodal reasoning capabilities. Accurate text-based descriptions represent an effective interim solution for visual misinterpretation issues in engineering AI applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [82] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses the cultural positioning bias of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating that these models tend to adopt US-centric perspectives while treating non-mainstream cultures as outsiders. It introduces the CultureLens benchmark and mitigation methods to measure and reduce such biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the cultural positioning bias found in large language models, where these models default to a mainstream US cultural perspective and do not fairly represent less dominant cultures.

Method: The authors propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 prompts and 3 metrics to measure the bias in LLMs using a culturally situated interview script task. Furthermore, they introduce two inference-time mitigation methods: (1) Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) and (2) Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) with single-agent and multi-agent frameworks designed to reduce bias through self-reflection, critique, and refinement.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that LLMs favor insider tones for US-centric scripts but often use outsider stances for less dominant cultures. The proposed agent-based methods, particularly MFA, effectively mitigate these biases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed benchmarks and frameworks are effective tools for identifying and mitigating cultural positioning biases, offering promising directions for improving fairness in generative LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval introduces a dynamic evaluation benchmark to study hallucination in Persian language large language models (LLMs), revealing difficulties in detecting hallucinated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent challenges with hallucination in LLMs, especially for low-resource languages like Persian, motivated the creation of a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate these issues in Persian.

Method: The study employs a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline with human validation to identify hallucinations in QA and summarization tasks. Log probabilities are analyzed for believable hallucination detection, along with cultural context evaluations by annotators.

Result: The evaluation of 12 open- and closed-source LLMs showed they struggle with detecting hallucinated Persian text. Providing external knowledge reduces hallucination slightly, while Persian-trained models showed no distinct advantage.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the difficulty LLMs face in handling hallucination in low-resource languages like Persian, and suggest that external document support only partially addresses the issue.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) improve information-seeking tasks but require better personalization capabilities to meet diverse user needs. BESPOKE introduces a benchmark for evaluating personalization in such LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in systematic evaluation of personalization in search-augmented large language models, which is needed to recognize diverse user intents and deliver tailored information.

Method: The study developed BESPOKE, a benchmark that uses authentic human chat and search histories, queries with detailed preferences, and feedback paired with diagnostic preference scores.

Result: BESPOKE facilitated systematic analyses that identified critical requirements for improving personalization in LLMs tailored for information-seeking tasks.

Conclusion: BESPOKE serves as a valuable resource for fine-grained evaluation of personalized search-augmented LLMs, enhancing their relevance and effectiveness.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [85] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ is a dataset designed to evaluate social biases in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) through speech-based scenarios, building on the text-focused BBQ benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and measure social bias in SLMs arising from both content and acoustic elements, which are unique due to the addition of spoken language.

Method: The study extends the BBQ benchmark to speech, converting every context into controlled voice conditions for bias and accuracy evaluation, and applies it to two SLMs: LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio.

Result: LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias but amplifies gender and accent bias, while Qwen2-Audio reduces these biases while maintaining content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ offers a unified framework to diagnose biases in SLMs from both content and acoustic perspectives, enabling deeper insights into bias-related issues in spoken contexts.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [86] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs), introducing a dataset to systematically analyze this issue and revealing paradoxical patterns in male-oriented bias and gender-independent responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address acoustic-based gender differentiation in SpeechLMs, which leads to biased and paradoxical responses during human-AI voice interaction.

Method: Developed a dataset with 9,208 speech samples in three categories and evaluated SpeechLMs (LLaMA-Omni series) and Whisper speech encoders to analyze gender biases and response patterns.

Result: SpeechLMs exhibit male-oriented responses in gender-stereotypical scenarios, fail to differentiate appropriately in gender-dependent contexts, and the bias originates from Whisper speech encoders.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs prioritize fairness but fail to appropriately use gender information, necessitating advanced techniques to eliminate gender biases while maintaining contextual appropriateness.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [88] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the ROC framework for multimodal relation extraction (RE) to overcome the limitations of classification-based methods by treating RE as a retrieval task, achieving superior performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal RE approaches have limitations in incorporating structural constraints and offering semantic depth, leading to inefficiencies in fine-grained relation understanding.

Method: ROC reformulates RE as a semantics-driven retrieval task, incorporates entity type and positional cues via a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language with a large language model, and uses contrastive learning for entity-relation alignment.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on MNRE and MORE benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher robustness and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: ROC advances multimodal RE by addressing structural and semantic limitations in prior methods, offering a more effective and interpretable approach for relation extraction.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

### [89] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can sometimes wrongly associate syntax with domain knowledge, which can impact their understanding of task instructions. The authors identify and analyze such spurious correlations and propose testing frameworks and training data improvements to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to improve LLM performance on instruction-following tasks by addressing spurious associations between syntax and domain knowledge. Such associations may lead models to misunderstand or misinterpret prompts, especially in safety-critical applications.

Method: The researchers used a synthetic training dataset to analyze syntactic-domain correlations and their effect on model performance. They developed an evaluation framework to detect such issues in open-source (OLMo-2, Llama-4) and closed-source (GPT-4o) models.

Result: The analysis revealed that syntactic-domain correlations negatively affect performance on entity knowledge tasks, with a drop in accuracy (mean 0.51 ± 0.06). The study also demonstrated that this issue exists in widely-used datasets (e.g., FlanV2) and can be exploited to bypass refusals in safety-finetuned models.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations and improve training data by introducing syntactic diversity within domains. These measures can mitigate spurious correlations and improve model reliability, especially in safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores computational humour in NLP, emphasizing challenges in understanding, generating, and explaining humour, while highlighting the gap between AI and human humor capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humour is a fundamental human trait and a challenging NLP task, requiring reasoning and context to assess the capabilities of modern large language models.

Method: The authors survey the current state of computational humour, focusing on generative tasks like creation and explanation, and address the scarcity of research and challenges in the field.

Result: The literature reveals limited progress in generating and explaining humour beyond puns, with state-of-the-art models still significantly behind human capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of computational humour as an NLP subdiscipline, proposing future directions that address humour's subjective and ethically ambiguous nature.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [91] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential personally identifiable information (PII) leakage in chatbots built on small language models (SLMs) and proposes a new method, GEP, to investigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research lies in the rising appeal of SLMs for their comparable performance to large language models (LLMs) while being more energy-efficient. However, the security aspect, specifically PII leakage, has not been adequately studied for SLMs.

Method: The authors finetuned a chatbot called ChatBioGPT using BioGPT's backbone and medical datasets, then evaluated the limitations of template-based PII extraction methods. They introduced a novel GEP (Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based) method to better detect PII leakage under SLM conditions.

Result: Their experiments with GEP showed it could detect up to 60 times more PII leakage compared to template-based methods. GEP also maintained effectiveness in more complex scenarios involving free-style PII insertions with varied syntactic forms, achieving a PII leakage detection rate of up to 4.53%.

Conclusion: The study concludes that conventional template-based PII detection methods are insufficient for SLMs. The proposed GEP method effectively identifies significant PII leakage risks, contributing to improved security assessment in SLM-based chatbots.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for large language models (LLMs) that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration, significantly improving reasoning accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of explicit retrieval in scientific reasoning and the dilution of strong solutions in multi-agent environments.

Method: The approach involves a token-level Monitor-based retrieval module for implicit knowledge integration, and two hierarchical refinement strategies: Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR).

Result: The framework sets new accuracy benchmarks (48.3%) on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold dataset, reduces token usage by 53.5%, and improves efficiency with 43.7% fewer agent steps.

Conclusion: The combination of implicit knowledge augmentation and structured refinement can effectively address reasoning inefficiencies in LLMs, outperforming current baselines across multiple domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLaw, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Chinese legal knowledge and reasoning. It focuses on their ability to retrieve statutes and reason through legal cases, revealing significant weaknesses in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in analyzing legal texts, but their general pre-training obscures a true understanding of legal knowledge, raising questions about their reliability in this specialized field.

Method: The authors designed CLaw with two key components: (1) a detailed corpus of 306 Chinese national statutes, segmented and timestamped for rigorous retrieval evaluation, and (2) 254 case-based reasoning challenges sourced from Supreme Court materials to test practical legal reasoning.

Result: Empirical evaluations showed that current LLMs struggle with accurately retrieving legal provisions and applying them in reasoning, undermining their reliability in legal tasks.

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires accurate knowledge retrieval coupled with robust reasoning capabilities, which could be improved using techniques like supervised fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation. The paper contributes a benchmark and insights to advance domain-specific LLMs, particularly in law.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem is introduced to enhance long-term conversational agents by using a sentence-level graph memory approach to handle dialogue history beyond LLM context windows, achieving improved accuracy in question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational agents require advanced memory management to effectively handle dialogue histories that exceed LLM context windows. Existing methods face challenges in organizing and retrieving relevant information across granular contexts.

Method: The paper proposes SGMem, a system that uses sentence-level graphs within chunked units to represent dialogues across various contextual levels. It combines raw dialogue retrieval with generated memory, such as summaries and insights, to provide coherent and relevant context for response generation.

Result: Experimental evaluations on LongMemEval and LoCoMo datasets show that SGMem enhances accuracy and outperforms strong baseline approaches in long-term conversational question answering.

Conclusion: SGMem demonstrates the ability to better organize and retrieve dialogue histories for conversational agents, enabling improved coherence and relevance in long-term interactions.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces QCG-RAG, a graph-based framework addressing limitations in retrieval-augmented generation by enabling query-granular indexing and multi-hop retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods face limitations due to granularity issues, such as token costs and loss of context in fine-grained graphs or failure to capture nuanced relationships in coarse-grained graphs.

Method: QCG-RAG employs Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to create query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, paired with a multi-hop retrieval mechanism to obtain relevant chunks for reasoning.

Result: QCG-RAG outperformed previous graph-based and chunk-based RAG methods in question answering tasks, showing enhanced accuracy in experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG datasets.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG sets a new standard for multi-hop reasoning by resolving granularity dilemmas and improving retrieval and reasoning in long-context understanding tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of homonym duplication in generative diffusion models and proposes a method to measure and mitigate this problem, particularly focusing on its amplification due to Anglocentric bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges posed by homonyms in generative diffusion models, which can lead to errors in image generation and are further amplified by translation-related biases.

Method: The authors propose a measurement method for duplication rates and use both automated Vision-Language Model (VLM) assessments and human evaluations. Additionally, they explore prompt expansion as a mitigation method.

Result: The proposed evaluation framework effectively measures homonym duplication rates, and the prompt expansion method successfully mitigates issues related to both homonym duplication and Anglocentric bias.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust evaluation framework and a simple, yet effective solution (prompt expansion) to address homonym duplication in generative diffusion models.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses output homogenization in large language models by proposing task-dependent measures of diversity and introducing techniques to improve functional diversity while retaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that output homogenization in language models isn't always problematic but depends on the specific task category, highlighting the need for task-dependent approaches to evaluating and mitigating such homogenization.

Method: The authors introduce a task taxonomy with eight categories, a task-anchored functional diversity metric, and a sampling technique tailored to improve or preserve homogenization based on the task requirements.

Result: They find that their task-anchored sampling technique successfully increases functional diversity in tasks requiring it, while maintaining quality and preserving homogenization for tasks where it's desirable.

Conclusion: Task-dependent conceptualizations and techniques significantly enhance the evaluation and control of output homogenization in large language models, challenging the presumption of a trade-off between diversity and quality.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

*Irina Tolstykh,Aleksandra Tsybina,Sergey Yakubson,Maksim Kuprashevich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLMTrace, a large-scale, bilingual dataset tailored for detecting AI-generated text and localizing it at the character level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of adequate training data for robust detection systems of AI-generated text, especially datasets that include modern models, bilingual content, and mixed human-AI authorship.

Method: LLMTrace was built using a range of modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing character-level annotations and supporting tasks like binary classification and AI-generated interval detection.

Result: The dataset is bilingual (English and Russian) and includes annotations for precise localization of AI-generated segments within texts.

Conclusion: LLMTrace is expected to help train and evaluate advanced and practical AI detection models, addressing gaps in existing datasets.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how input perturbations affect Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning outputs, providing a theoretical framework and validating it experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite methods aiming to optimize prompts for CoT models, there is no theoretical understanding of how input perturbations impact reasoning outputs, which limits further advancements in prompt optimization.

Method: The authors theoretically derived an upper bound for input perturbations and analyzed its correlation with reasoning steps. They extended their conclusions to the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model and validated the results using experiments with datasets and models.

Result: The study proves that the impact of input perturbations is positively correlated with reasoning steps and cannot be eliminated. For the LSA model, it shows this upper bound is inversely related to input embeddings and hidden state norms, confirmed by experimental results.

Conclusion: The findings provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence that input perturbations significantly influence CoT outputs, which has implications for prompt optimization and model robustness.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically

### [100] [DisCoCLIP: A Distributional Compositional Tensor Network Encoder for Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21287)
*Kin Ian Lo,Hala Hawashin,Mina Abbaszadeh,Tilen Limback-Stokin,Hadi Wazni,Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP enhances vision-language models by integrating syntactic structures using tensor networks, significantly improving compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vision-language models that overlook the compositional structure of language, leading to failures in tasks sensitive to word order and grammatical structure.

Method: DisCoCLIP uses a frozen CLIP vision transformer and a novel tensor network text encoder, which incorporates grammatical structure through distributional word tensors derived from Combinatory Categorial Grammar parsing. Tensor decompositions reduce high-order tensor parameters for efficiency.

Result: DisCoCLIP outperformed baseline models, improving CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy to 82.4%, and ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%. It reached 93.7% on the new SVO-Swap benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable and efficient representations, enhancing vision-language models' compositional reasoning significantly.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

*Pranjal A. Chitale,Varun Gumma,Sanchit Ahuja,Prashant Kodali,Manan Uppadhyay,Deepthi Sudharsan,Sunayana Sitaram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Updesh, a culturally contextualized synthetic dataset for 13 Indian languages, generated using large open-source LLMs grounded in Wikipedia content. The dataset improves AI model performance, particularly in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing effective multilingual AI while incorporating cultural grounding and addressing low-resource language settings.

Method: A bottom-up data generation strategy using large LLMs grounded in language-specific Wikipedia content, as opposed to translating from high-resource languages. This led to the creation of the Updesh dataset with 9.5M data points in 13 Indian languages.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Updesh showed significant improvements in generative tasks and remained competitive on NLU tasks, with pronounced gains in low and medium-resource languages. Human evaluations noted high data quality but also highlighted areas needing improvement.

Conclusion: Culturally and contextually aware data generation methods are vital for effective multilingual AI, particularly for low-resource languages, and Updesh exemplifies this potential.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates sycophantic behaviors in large language models (LLMs) by differentiating sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement. The behaviors are encoded as distinct and steerable directions in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sycophantic behaviors in LLMs arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.

Method: The researchers analyzed LLMs using techniques such as difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across various models and datasets.

Result: They found that sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement are encoded in distinct, independently steerable linear directions, and their structures are consistent across model families and scales.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors correspond to separate, independently controllable representations in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

### [103] [RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback & Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319)
*Zhilin Wang,Jiaqi Zeng,Olivier Delalleau,Ellie Evans,Daniel Egert,Hoo-Chang Shin,Felipe Soares,Yi Dong,Oleksii Kuchaiev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLBFF (Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback), a new RL paradigm that combines human feedback's versatility with rule-based precision to address limitations in existing RL methods for large language model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL paradigms, RLHF and RLVR, have weaknesses such as interpretability issues and scope limitations. The need for an approach combining human nuance with verifiable precision motivated the creation of RLBFF.

Method: RLBFF extracts binary principles from natural language feedback and trains reward models as entailment tasks. Principles are specified by users, grounding training and aligning behavior using customized criteria.

Result: Reward Models trained with RLBFF outperform Bradley-Terry models, ranking #1 on JudgeBench and RM-Bench, with additional benchmarks showing competitive or superior results at lower inference costs.

Conclusion: RLBFF effectively combines human-driven flexibility with rule-based precision, offering a superior and customizable approach for aligning large language models, supported by fully open-sourced methodologies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Conclusion: The work showcases how cross-discipline learning improves generalization and reliability in scientific reasoning tasks. The model and associated data are open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural
language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained
on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence
generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens
instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances
fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline

### [105] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method for detecting hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) using next-token probabilities (NTPs) to measure uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in VLMs, which compromise their reliability, and to develop a computationally efficient detection method.

Method: The approach involves training lightweight ML models using NTP-based features and validating the method on a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements labeled as hallucinated or not.

Result: The method demonstrates that NTP-based features are effective predictors of hallucinations, with performance comparable to strong VLMs. Combining NTPs with linguistic features or integrating VLM prediction scores further enhances performance.

Conclusion: NTP-based methods provide a simple and computationally efficient way to detect hallucinations in VLMs, improving their reliability.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight and sensor-independent module for cloud segmentation on multispectral Earth observation data, featuring efficient onboard processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the current challenges in cloud segmentation models, which are tightly bound to specific sensors and require ground-based processing, by creating a flexible, onboard solution.

Method: The paper presents Fast-SEnSeI, which employs a lightweight encoder module with an improved spectral descriptor, compact U-Net-based segmentation model, CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline, and sensor-independent processing for arbitrary band configurations.

Result: Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets show Fast-SEnSeI achieves accurate cloud segmentation across diverse spectral configurations.

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI enables efficient and flexible onboard cloud segmentation, addressing a critical need in Earth observation tasks, and demonstrates suitability for space-qualified hardware.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging Riemannian geometry for offline handwritten signature verification in writer-independent scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizing models for writer-independent settings in signature verification, particularly due to dependence on real-world datasets for training.

Method: The method uses geometric representations of signatures in the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix space, generates synthetic data via Riemannian Gaussian Mixtures, and employs a metric learning framework to train on these synthetic samples.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates low error rates in experiments conducted on two widely used signature datasets representing Western and Asian styles, including intra- and cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Generating synthetic data in the Riemannian space offers a promising solution for improving writer-independent signature verification models.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify various image generation and editing tasks into one efficient, high-performance framework, enabling both creativity and professional applications.

Method: The paper introduces a diffusion transformer model with a strong VAE, pretrained on billions of text-image pairs. It employs strategies like adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and speculative decoding for efficient inference.

Result: Seedream 4.0 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image and image editing tasks, achieving rapid generation of high-resolution images and excelling in complex multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 extends the traditional boundaries of text-to-image systems, offering a multifunctional creative tool with robust capabilities for generative AI, now accessible for users.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Contrastive Learning (CL) framework for breast cancer detection, achieving 96.7% accuracy using limited labeled data by leveraging semi-supervised learning with ResNet-50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited accuracy of deep learning methods in breast cancer detection due to the scarcity of large labeled datasets and to exploit smaller labeled datasets more effectively.

Method: The authors trained ResNet-50 in a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using a similarity index with a large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. They utilized data augmentation and transformations to further enhance the model's performance, followed by fine-tuning with a smaller labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed model achieved a high accuracy rate of 96.7% in breast cancer detection performance when evaluated on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, surpassing existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework can effectively address the challenge of limited labeled datasets while significantly improving the accuracy in breast cancer detection.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Foundation Models (FMs) for industrial image checks, finding that while FMs excel on public datasets, their performance falters on real-world industrial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Foundation Models can automate quality inspections for manufacturing by generalizing across domains and replacing supervised AI systems requiring labeled training data.

Method: Testing multiple Foundation Models on real-world industrial imagery and public image datasets, comparing their performances.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial image datasets but performed effectively on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Foundation Models currently struggle to generalize to real-world manufacturing data, despite their success in controlled public benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal Neural Space (NS) with an encoder-decoder architecture for efficient modular tasks in vision and imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models are inefficient for modular tasks since each requires separate latent mappings.

Method: The NS framework employs a lightweight CNN-based encoder-decoder that pre-computes generalizable features shared among multiple tasks.

Result: Experiments show successful application of NS in tasks like demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: NS reduces redundancy, enhances generalization across domain shifts, and lays a groundwork for efficient vision pipelines.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines optimizing image selection for training models tailored to edge camera systems, focusing on minimizing data transmission while maximizing model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating model performance for edge camera systems involves frequent training, but is limited by computational power and data transmission costs.

Method: The authors use a hybrid approach: a high-confidence stream-based data selection strategy combined with a diversity-based approach.

Result: The study found that the proposed method achieves high-quality models with fewer dataset queries and similar training loads.

Conclusion: High-confidence and diversity-based selection strategies enhance model quality while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained edge systems.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve virtual try-on systems by enabling fine styling control and simplifying mask creation.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models and image segmentation to automate binary mask generation based on user images and textual instructions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in virtual try-on when interoperated with existing models.

Conclusion: InstructVTON enhances virtual try-on accuracy and usability by addressing limitations of mask-based methods and incorporating advanced styling control.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on

*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepAFRNet, a deep learning model for recognizing altered fingerprints, achieving high accuracy on real-world altered fingerprint data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recognizing deliberately altered fingerprint patterns for biometric systems in sensitive applications.

Method: DeepAFRNet employs a VGG16 backbone for feature extraction, cosine similarity for embedding comparison, and performance evaluation on real-world altered fingerprint datasets.

Result: Achieved 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% accuracies on three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) using strict thresholds.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet is effective for recognizing altered fingerprints and addresses limitations of prior systems, showing promise for real-world use where accuracy and security are critical.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

*Hanna Yurchyk,Wei-Di Chang,Gregory Dudek,David Meger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing bimanual robotic manipulation by integrating attention maps from the DINOv2 vision transformer model into 3D voxel representations, achieving notable performance improvements in a benchmark task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic manipulation tasks by leveraging semantic visual cues extracted from pre-trained Vision Transformers, thereby enhancing robot policies.

Method: Attention maps from DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer model, are interpreted as saliency scores from RGB images. These scores are then transformed into 3D voxel-based semantic features and integrated into a behavior cloning policy.

Result: The proposed method improved the performance of a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy by 8.2% on average and 21.9% relatively in the RLBench bimanual manipulation benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating attention maps from Vision Transformers into voxel grids provides meaningful semantic information, significantly improving robotic manipulation capabilities in benchmark tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks 36 variants of real-time object detectors, like YOLOv12 and RT-DETRv2, for blueberry detection in natural environments using a new dataset of over 85,000 labeled instances. Fine-tuning with semi-supervised learning further improved detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in blueberry detection due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur, by leveraging deep learning and providing a benchmark analysis of advanced real-time object detectors.

Method: A new dataset with 661 annotated images and 85,879 instances was used to evaluate 36 variants of YOLO and RT-DETR object detectors. Fine-tuning was performed using semi-supervised learning on an additional 1,035 unlabeled images to improve performance.

Result: RT-DETRv2-X achieved the highest accuracy with a mAP@50 of 94.8% after fine-tuning, outperforming other models. Accuracy gains from semi-supervised learning ranged from -1.4% to 2.9%.

Conclusion: Benchmarking and semi-supervised learning proved effective for advancing blueberry detection. The models and datasets were made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy to improve deep learning performance in mammogram classification on the Mini-DDSM dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for mammogram interpretation faces challenges like limited dataset resolution and small sample sizes, which restrict its potential in breast cancer screening.

Method: The study employed ROI augmentation, where images during training were replaced probabilistically with random ROI crops sampled from a label-free bounding-box bank, adding jitter to increase variability. It used patient-level cross-validation with ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and efficiency metrics.

Result: ROI augmentation resulted in modest ROC-AUC performance gains, minor PR-AUC variations, and no additional inference-time cost.

Conclusion: Data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without additional labels or complex architectural adjustments.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method leveraging mirror reflections to create a virtual camera view for robust and generalizable 3D reconstruction from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify 3D reconstruction from single images by using mirror reflections to provide stereo information, which is common in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method involves generating a physically valid virtual camera view based on mirror reflections, implementing a symmetry-aware loss for pose refinement, and extending the framework to dynamic scenes. A synthetic dataset is provided for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the method's effectiveness in 3D reconstruction and pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a novel and efficient method for single-image 3D reconstruction by using mirror reflections, showing practical effectiveness across dynamic and static scenes.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Yiming Xiao,Archit Gupta,Miguel Esparza,Yu-Hsuan Ho,Antonia Sebastian,Hannah Weas,Rose Houck,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FacadeTrack, a framework for assessing building occupancy after disasters using street-level panoramic video linked to parcel data, achieving high precision and recall metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of accurately assessing building occupancy after disasters using imagery due to limitations in both overhead and street-view coverage.

Method: FacadeTrack combines panoramic street-level video with parcel alignment, view rectification for facade analysis, and attribute extraction to inform two decision strategies—rule-based and two-stage approaches.

Result: The two-stage approach demonstrated higher precision (0.927) and recall (0.781) compared to the one-stage rule-based method, which had a precision of 0.943 and recall of 0.728.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides scalable, auditable assessments of building occupancy post-disaster, making it suitable for emergency management workflows and offering insights to improve accuracy.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [120] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how humans use semantic representations alongside visual features to interpret social interactions, especially through moving shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the semantic and visual mechanisms humans employ to perceive social interactions from basic animations.

Method: Two studies: Study 1 involved participants labeling moving shapes, and Study 2 measured human similarity judgments for 27 social interactions and compared them with predictions from semantic and visual models.

Result: Semantic models, particularly verb-based embeddings, were found to complement visual features in explaining human judgments about social interactions.

Conclusion: Social perception integrates semantic and visual information, demonstrating a blend of abstract and visual representation in interpreting interactions.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

*Xiaowei Wang,Di Wang,Ke Li,Yifeng Wang,Chengjian Wang,Libin Sun,Zhihong Wu,Yiming Zhang,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles challenges in Cross-view Geo-localization (CVGL) by proposing the EGS framework, enhancing robustness and reliability under diverse conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVGL is challenged by appearance variations caused by UAV orientations and the difficulty in establishing reliable correspondences for global and fine-grained details.

Method: The method involves an E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for robust feature extraction under rotation and viewpoint shifts and a graph with a virtual super-node for blending global semantics with local details.

Result: The EGS framework demonstrated substantial performance gains and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed EGS framework enhances cross-domain generalization by addressing key CVGL challenges, offering a robust and effective solution to establish reliable correspondences across diverse viewpoints.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for infrared small target detection by introducing a Dual-Path Edge Network that separately addresses edge enhancement and semantic modeling through innovative modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to cluttered backgrounds and inherent design conflicts in deep models, such as balancing spatial details and semantic robustness.

Method: The Dual-Path Edge Network has two paths: (1) a Bidirectional Interaction Module utilizing Local and Global Self-Attention, including a Transformer architecture, for semantic modeling, and (2) a Multi-Edge Refiner enhancing edge details via Taylor finite difference operators and attention-driven mechanisms.

Result: The proposed framework achieves precise infrared small target detection by integrating multi-scale edge refinement and robust semantic modeling, effectively suppressing noise.

Conclusion: This approach successfully combines structural semantics with edge refinement to advance the performance of infrared small target detection in noisy environments.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework and dataset for studying and predicting group intentions in collaborative settings, specifically using basketball videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in analyzing and predicting collective intentions in group settings, which is often overlooked compared to individual intentions.

Method: Introduces "Group Intention Forecasting (GIF)" as a new task. Proposes SHOT, a large-scale annotated basketball dataset, and GIFT, a framework to predict group intentions by extracting individual features and group dynamics.

Result: Experimental validation highlights the effectiveness of the SHOT dataset and the GIFT framework in forecasting group intentions.

Conclusion: The SHOT dataset and GIFT framework provide a strong basis for advancing research in group intention forecasting, particularly by leveraging multi-individual and multi-level information in dynamic group scenarios.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Neptune-X, a framework that improves maritime object detection using synthetic data generation and active sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address limitations in maritime object detection caused by scarce annotated data and poor generalization in diverse maritime scenarios.

Method: Introduces the X-to-Maritime generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention for realistic scene synthesis and Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for optimizing training data relevance.

Result: Neptune-X achieved significant gains in detection accuracy, especially in challenging maritime conditions, and sets a new standard in maritime scene synthesis.

Conclusion: By combining generative models and task-aware sample selection, Neptune-X overcomes key challenges in maritime object detection and enhances performance in underrepresented scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents STELLA, a novel Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, supported by the new CRESENT-365 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pose estimation accuracy in challenging lunar mapping mission conditions involving sparse, oblique, and long-duration imagery.

Method: STELLA integrates crater detection using Mask R-CNN, identification through descriptor-less methods, pose solving via perspective-n-crater algorithm, and orbit determination in a batch process.

Result: Experiments on the CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 datasets demonstrate high accuracy with metre-level positional precision and sub-degree attitude accuracy under varying conditions.

Conclusion: STELLA represents a significant advancement in Crater-Based Navigation for lunar mapping, offering robust pose estimation over year-long campaigns.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how independent visual and linguistic models align conceptually, finding that alignment strengthens in semantic representations and aligns with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how and where unimodal networks (visual and linguistic) align conceptually, and whether this alignment reflects human preferences and semantic understanding.

Method: The paper explores representational alignment using mid-to-late layers of vision and language models, with tests on semantic robustness, human judgment alignment via a "Pick-a-Pic" task, and effects of exemplar aggregation.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers as networks shift to shared semantic representations, robust to appearance changes but sensitive to semantic disruption. Human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in embedding spaces, and exemplar aggregation amplifies alignment.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code aligned with human judgments, strengthened further by averaging embeddings across exemplars.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

### [127] [FreeInsert: Personalized Object Insertion with Geometric and Style Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20756)
*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a new framework that allows precise 3D geometric control and style-consistent object insertion into images without requiring additional training, leveraging 3D generation models and diffusion adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to overcome geometric control and style-consistency challenges in existing image editing methods, which often struggle with maintaining realism and require extensive training for customization.

Method: The proposed method, FreeInsert, first converts 2D objects into 3D using 3D generation models, enabling 3D-level interactive editing. The edited 3D object is re-rendered into 2D and combined with style and content control mechanisms using diffusion adapters, creating final edited images with geometric and style consistency.

Result: FreeInsert achieves significant improvements in providing geometric control over inserted objects as well as style consistency between the object and the background, all without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert represents a novel and accessible approach to image editing that bridges the gap in geometric control and style consistency, showcasing the potential of 3D generation models for personalized image composition tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a novel framework enhancing identity-based text-to-image models by improving scene diversity, personalization control, and efficiency through innovative methods like PerGeneration and ResInversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with scene quality, control precision, and identity fidelity, necessitating a method to improve these shortcomings without extensive retraining.

Method: The approach employs a triple-flow fused PerGeneration method to unify generation and reconstruction processes and introduces ResInversion to expedite inversion for personalized models.

Result: CustomEnhancer delivers state-of-the-art performance in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls, while drastically reducing inversion time by 129 times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of personalized text-to-image synthesis, offering precise control and high-quality outputs with minimal computational costs.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

*Hyomin Choi,Heeji Han,Chris Rosewarne,Fabien Racapé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompressAI-Vision, an open-source evaluation platform to optimize video compression for neural network-based computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for a unified platform to optimize video compression methods for varying computer vision tasks and neural network models.

Method: The authors developed CompressAI-Vision, incorporating standard codecs and datasets to evaluate coding tools based on compression efficiency and task performance in two inference scenarios.

Result: The platform was demonstrated to achieve compression gains while preserving task accuracy and has been adopted by MPEG for its Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard.

Conclusion: CompressAI-Vision is a useful and publicly available resource that addresses challenges in vision-based video compression and supports standard development efforts.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision

introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools
compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining
task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.

### [130] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework to tackle domain shifts in cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) for medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of domain shifts in medical image segmentation, particularly in scenarios where labeled and unlabeled training data experience domain shifts, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets.

Method: The proposed DAC framework is based on co-training with two sub-models that leverage cross pseudo supervision. It incorporates feature-level supervision to address inaccuracies caused by domain shifts and uses asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to enhance discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse.

Result: Experiments on medical imaging datasets like Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM demonstrated robust generalizability of the DAC framework, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The DAC framework successfully improves performance in the CD-SSDG setting, addressing both domain shift and limited annotation issues through innovative supervision techniques.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

### [131] [Real-Time Object Detection Meets DINOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20787)
*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEIMv2, an advanced real-time object detector framework that achieves superior performance-cost trade-offs across diverse deployment scenarios, surpassing previous models like YOLO and establishing new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve real-time object detection frameworks by building on DEIM's success and incorporating DINOv3 features, seeking enhanced performance across GPU, edge, and mobile environments.

Method: The framework utilizes techniques like DINOv3-pretrained/distilled backbones, Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) for multi-scale feature extraction, HGNetv2 with pruning for lightweight models, a simplified decoder, and an upgraded dense O2O design.

Result: DEIMv2 models achieve state-of-the-art performance with reduced parameters. For example, DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3 M parameters, outperforming models with larger parameter counts. The DEIMv2-S model exceeds 50 AP with less than 10 M parameters, and DEIMv2-Pico achieves 38.5 AP with just 1.5 M parameters, matching YOLOv10-Nano at half the size.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes a new paradigm for real-time object detection frameworks by achieving high accuracy and efficiency across both high-end and lightweight deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA integrates adversarial training into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for vision-language models, improving robustness against adversarial attacks without significant loss in clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are central to safety-critical applications but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper aims to enhance the robustness of such models without compromising their efficiency.

Method: The authors propose DAC-LoRA, a framework that employs a dynamic curriculum of progressively challenging adversarial attacks, guided by First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and TRADES-inspired loss, within the PEFT methods like LoRA.

Result: DAC-LoRA achieves significant improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy, demonstrating it can integrate seamlessly with existing fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA offers an effective and lightweight solution to enhance the adversarial robustness of vision-language models, contributing broadly to the AI safety landscape.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedDSPG, a generative approach to enhance federated domain generalization using domain-specific soft prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing federated domain generalization (FDG) methods, which struggle to generalize to unknown domains due to limited diversity in learned soft prompts.

Method: FedDSPG generates domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) using content and domain knowledge, training a generative model across clients. At inference, DSPs are produced for unseen domains to guide downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show that FedDSPG surpasses strong FDG baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Integrating generative principles into federated learning enhances FDG by enabling robust generalization to unseen domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: LumbarCLIP is a novel framework integrating imaging (MRI) and textual (radiological descriptions) data using contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in lumbar spine diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust diagnostic system that can effectively combine and analyze lumbar spine MRI scans with accompanying radiological text reports.

Method: The framework leverages contrastive language-image pretraining by integrating visual encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder. Dense image and text representations are projected into a shared embedding space with learnable projection heads and optimized using soft CLIP loss.

Result: LumbarCLIP achieves up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score in downstream classification tasks, handling class imbalance effectively. Linear projection heads outperformed non-linear ones for cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: LumbarCLIP lays a strong foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis, offering a powerful tool for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoisonVID, a black-box attack targeting prompt-guided video sampling in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), achieving high success rates and raising concerns about the robustness of current sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in assessing the safety of prompt-guided video sampling strategies in VideoLLMs and to understand their vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors develop PoisonVID, a black-box poisoning attack that uses a closed-loop optimization strategy with universal perturbations, leveraging a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini to suppress relevance scores for harmful frames.

Result: PoisonVID demonstrates an attack success rate of 82%–99% across three distinct prompt-guided sampling strategies and various advanced VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: The work underscores the vulnerability of current prompt-guided sampling approaches in VideoLLMs and emphasizes the need for safer and more robust sampling strategies in the future.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Game of Regularizer (GoR), a method that improves quantization-aware training with knowledge distillation for better AI model compression, achieving superior performance and balanced loss handling under low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing task-specific and distillation losses in quantization-aware training under low-bit settings, which existing methods struggle with due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes.

Method: The proposed method, Game of Regularizer (GoR), adaptively balances loss objectives in quantization-aware training using two trainable parameters for dynamic regularization, and it also introduces an ensemble distillation framework (QAT-EKD-GoR) leveraging multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR shows consistent outperformance compared to state-of-the-art quantization-aware training methods across image classification, object detection, and large language model compression tasks while ensuring fast inference and near full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: The GoR and EKD-GoR frameworks offer robust solutions for compressing AI models, improving their performance, and enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware with accuracy comparable or better than full-precision models.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge evaluated the performance of automated deep learning systems for plant identification using large, noisy datasets from the web compared to smaller, expert-curated ones, involving 10,000 plant species and over 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated plant identification systems to work at a continental scale by leveraging both expert-curated datasets and large, noisy datasets from the web.

Method: The challenge compared the effectiveness of training datasets—one being smaller but validated by experts, and the other being large and noisy from the web—in identifying plant species.

Result: Findings contrasted the performance of systems trained on large, noisy datasets with those trained on small, reliable datasets in a practical test scenario using third-source data from the Pl@ntNet app.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility and challenges of using noisy web-sourced data for building automated plant identification systems and provides valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is introduced as a class-agnostic, cross-species plant counting model outperforming current methods in terms of performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of species-dependent plant counting models and propose a solution that is robust, efficient, and capable of cross-species counting.

Method: The authors extend the TasselNet model to TasselNetV4, integrating the extract-and-match paradigm from CAC and a vision transformer while incorporating multi-branch box-aware local counters to improve robustness.

Result: TasselNetV4 achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to current CAC models on two challenging datasets: PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 represents a foundational model for class-agnostic plant counting, showcasing adaptability across species, scales, and scenes.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-supervised method with a biomarker topology engine to improve retinal biomarker segmentation in OCT scans, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retinal segmentation methods often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model interactions between retinal layers and lesions effectively, and lack topological accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised model incorporating a biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomical correctness, joint modeling of layers and lesions, and disentangled spatial/style representation.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on public and internal OCT datasets, showing robust generalization to pathological cases using partially annotated data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of incorporating anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate and reliable retinal biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the LifeCLEF 2016 plant identification challenge, which aimed to evaluate plant ID methods on 110,000+ images of 1,000 species, factoring in open-set recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve plant identification methods under real-world conditions, focusing on large-scale plant datasets and the challenge of unknown classes in biodiversity monitoring.

Method: The identification task used a large dataset of plant images and treated it as an open-set recognition problem, emphasizing robustness against unknown classes. Participating groups used diverse systems and approaches to address this task.

Result: The challenge provided insights into the performance of participating systems and identified strengths and limitations related to open-set recognition in plant identification.

Conclusion: The challenge underlined the difficulty of recognizing unknown classes while demonstrating progress in scalable and robust plant identification systems for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs in KB-VQA tasks by refining visual information, offering a cost-effective method without requiring expensive training.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

### [142] [The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20878)
*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study systematically analyzes the relationship between perceptual optimization objectives and their effectiveness as image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. It highlights an asymmetry where metrics that excel in IQA aren't necessarily effective for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the unexplored correlation and asymmetry between perceptual optimization objectives and their utility as IQA metrics.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic analysis of fidelity and adversarial objectives in optimization and IQA, assessing how various architectures and objectives interact.

Result: They discovered a misalignment: fidelity metrics good for IQA aren't equally beneficial for optimization. Additionally, discriminator design impacts optimization effectiveness, with patch-level and convolutional architectures delivering better detail reconstruction.

Conclusion: The findings advance the understanding and design of optimization loss functions, indicating that principles of IQA transferability and discriminator design are key for perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

*Zhifei Li,Feng Qiu,Yiran Wang,Yujing Xia,Kui Xiao,Miao Zhang,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IOG-VQA, an advanced Visual Question Answering model using Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-based debiasing to overcome dataset bias and improve reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models face challenges due to biases in training data, leading to limited generalization and reliance on superficial patterns.

Method: Integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention to model complex interactions between objects and uses GAN-based debiasing to create balanced data distributions.

Result: IOG-VQA achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets, excelling in addressing dataset biases and imbalances.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of handling object interactions and biases to improve performance and generalization in Visual Question Answering models.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

*Tristan S. W. Stevens,Oisín Nolan,Jean-Luc Robert,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of restoring video sequences with noise and background artifacts by integrating low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling into a method called Nuclear Diffusion, showing improved results in cardiac ultrasound dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing and restoring video sequences with structured noise and background artifacts are challenging with existing methods. Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods often fail to capture the variability in real-world video data.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid framework called Nuclear Diffusion that combines low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video restoration, particularly focusing on medical imaging.

Result: When applied to cardiac ultrasound dehazing, Nuclear Diffusion demonstrates superior performance in contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic) compared to traditional RPCA methods.

Conclusion: The study shows the effectiveness of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for improving video restoration performance, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

*Shuqiao Liang,Jian Liu,Renzhang Chen,Quanlong Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FerretNet, a neural network designed for efficient synthetic image detection using local pixel dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improved realism of synthetic images generated by models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs challenges detection methods.

Method: Two artifacts from generation are exploited: latent distribution deviations and decoding-induced smoothing effects. Local pixel dependencies are used to reconstruct images and detect disruptions.

Result: FerretNet, despite being lightweight (1.1M parameters), achieves 97.1% accuracy across 22 generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering robust and efficient detection capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MoTIF, a concept bottleneck framework tailored for video classification, emphasizing interpretability through human-interpretable concepts with temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend conceptual models like Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) from static image classification to video classification while addressing challenges posed by temporal dependencies.

Method: Introduced MoTIF, an interpretable architectural design inspired by transformers, tailored for handling sequences of arbitrary length in video data. It incorporates three perspectives: global concept importance, local concept relevance, and temporal dependencies.

Result: MoTIF effectively transfers the concept-based modeling paradigm to video data, providing insights into concept contributions over time and achieving competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of interpretable concept-based models in video classification, offering improved understanding of temporal concepts and actions in videos.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using particle filters for 3D object localization in scenarios where dense depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction are infeasible, particularly for drone-based wildfire monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of 3D object localization in situations with limited computational resources or distant objects, specifically for safety-critical applications like wildfire monitoring.

Method: The researchers applied particle filters for single and multiple target localization tasks using 3D simulations and drone-based image segmentation sequences with GNSS-based camera pose estimates.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that particle filters effectively solve practical 3D localization tasks under the described constraints and can be integrated with pre-existing image segmentation models.

Conclusion: Particle filters offer a flexible, detection-method-independent solution for 3D object localization tasks, making them viable for challenging applications such as drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwinMamba, an improved model for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery, effectively addressing local and global feature integration by combining Mamba-style scanning with Swin Transformer principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery, which faces challenges of high resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales.

Method: SwinMamba incorporates a four-stage architecture where the first two stages focus on local feature extraction using Mamba-style localized scanning and the last two stages leverage global scanning for contextual integration, utilizing overlapping shifted windows for better inter-region communication.

Result: Experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show superior performance of SwinMamba compared to state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SwinMamba is an effective and efficient method for tackling semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery by balancing local detail extraction with global context integration.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PackMIL, a framework to optimize computational pathology tasks, addressing challenges like extreme sequence lengths and limited supervision. The technique improves efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets challenges in computational pathology, including the handling of whole slide images with extreme sequence lengths, variations, and high data heterogeneity under limited supervision, which impact training efficiency and optimization.

Method: It proposes a pack-based MIL framework to batch-process data sequences, a residual branch for enhancing multi-slide supervision, and an attention-driven downsampler to address redundancy in features.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 8% improvement in accuracy while reducing training time to just 12% compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Focusing on data challenges in computational pathology offers substantial potential for improved efficiency and accuracy, especially in the context of evolving foundation models.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a diffusion model that generates physically plausible human motion by directly incorporating environmental parameters, removing the need for costly simulator calls during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to creating physically plausible human motion are computationally expensive due to their reliance on sequential simulators.

Method: SimDiff integrates physical environment parameters into the diffusion model's denoising process, avoiding repeated simulator calls and enabling fine-grained control.

Result: SimDiff generates efficient, physically plausible human motion and performs well even under unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: SimDiff successfully addresses computational inefficiencies, provides control over physical coefficients, and generalizes across diverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores why certain vision architectures are more robust to Gaussian noise and provides theoretical and practical design rules based on empirical evaluations of 1,174 pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reasons behind the inherent robustness of specific vision architectures to additive Gaussian noise and uncover actionable design principles.

Method: The authors evaluated 1,174 pretrained vision models and identified four design patterns affecting robustness. They conducted a theoretical analysis to explain and validate the observed correlations, focusing on low-pass stem kernels, anti-aliased downsampling, pooling methods, and preprocessing methods in supervised vs. CLIP ViTs.

Result: The study found design rules such as using larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, and average pooling, which improved accuracy by up to 21.6 percentage points and caused up to 506 rank improvements in model robustness. It also explained why supervised ViTs are more robust than CLIP ViTs.

Conclusion: The paper disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, providing theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing vision models that are more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Motivation: To systematically review and understand the growing role of Scene Graphs (SGs) in decoding complex surgical environments and improving various aspects of surgical systems.

Method: Utilized a PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review method to map research progress, applications, methodologies, and future SG directions in surgery.

Result: Rapid development in SG technologies, overcoming challenges in annotation and real-time use, with specialized foundation models surpassing generalist models for specific surgical tasks.

Conclusion: SGs are becoming a cornerstone technology aimed at revolutionizing surgical safety, efficiency, monitoring, and training systems through intelligent semantic bridging.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the crucial need for detecting defects in laser power meter sensor coatings, which can affect accuracy in medical and industrial laser energy measurements.

Method: The proposed system consists of three components: preprocessing using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering, synthetic data augmentation using StyleGAN2, and a UFlow-based neural network for anomaly detection. Importantly, the training only uses defect-free images.

Result: The system achieves 93.8% accuracy on defective samples and 89.3% accuracy on defect-free samples, with impressive image-level and pixel-level AUROC scores of 0.957 and 0.961 respectively. Processing time is 0.5 seconds per image.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient, offering reliable defect detection without the need for large annotated defect datasets. It also promises cost savings and practical feasibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASTER, a modular framework for summarizing lengthy financial advisory videos by extracting multimodal features and aligning visual and textual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of summarizing lengthy and multimodal financial advisory content, making it more accessible and actionable.

Method: FASTER combines tools such as BLIP for visual semantic extraction, OCR for textual recognition, Whisper-based transcription, and a DPO-based loss function for improved summary precision and coherence. It utilizes a ranker mechanism for aligning visual keyframes with summarized text.

Result: FASTER performs strongly in experiments, demonstrating robustness and generalizability when compared to existing LLMs and VLMs. A novel dataset, Fin-APT, was introduced to support multimodal research.

Conclusion: FASTER significantly enhances the accessibility of financial advisory content, sets a new benchmark for multimodal summarization, and opens new research avenues with its novel dataset and framework.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

### [156] [An Adaptor for Triggering Semi-Supervised Learning to Out-of-Box Serve Deep Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20976)
*Yue Duan,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ASD, a method to enable self-supervised learning (SSL) models to perform image clustering without requiring any pretraining or prerequisites, achieving strong performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL-based deep image clustering methods require prerequisites like pretraining or a trained clustering model, restricting their immediate application.

Method: ASD involves randomly sampling pseudo-labeled data for instance-level classification, using prediction transitions to infer high-level similarities, and assigning cluster-level labels for training SSL learners directly on unlabeled data.

Result: ASD demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks in image clustering with only minor accuracy gaps (e.g., 1.33% on CIFAR-10) compared to SSL methods that use ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: ASD enables the cold-start of SSL learners for clustering tasks without prerequisites, outperforming existing methods and capable of enhancing other SSL-based clustering approaches.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

### [157] [SiNGER: A Clearer Voice Distills Vision Transformers Further](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20986)
*Geunhyeok Yu,Sunjae Jeong,Yoonyoung Choi,Jaeseung Kim,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiNGER, a novel framework to improve knowledge distillation by suppressing high-norm artifacts while preserving informative signals in Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers degrade feature representation quality and hinder effective knowledge distillation to student models.

Method: SiNGER refines teacher features using nullspace-guided perturbations to suppress artifacts and maintain meaningful signals. This is efficiently implemented using a LoRA-based adapter.

Result: SiNGER consistently enhances student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks and generating interpretable representations.

Conclusion: The proposed SiNGER framework successfully mitigates the trade-off between artifact suppression and signal preservation, leading to improved model performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

### [158] [A Single Neuron Works: Precise Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21008)
*Qinqin He,Jiaqi Weng,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNCE, a method to prevent harmful content generation in text-to-image models by targeting single neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for precise concept erasure to mitigate safety risks in text-to-image models without compromising image quality.

Method: SNCE uses a sparse autoencoder to map text embeddings into a disentangled latent space and identifies concept-specific neurons through modulated frequency scoring.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art performance in erasing harmful concepts while preserving generation quality for non-targeted concepts, and shows robustness to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables precise and robust prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image models, with minimal quality degradation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KDSS is a new sub-sampling method for biological point clouds that eliminates the need for down-sampling, enabling full-resolution segmentation across various plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving point cloud segmentation for plant organs without limiting methods to specific plant species, sensors, or using disruptive down-sampling.

Method: KDSS is a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm that retains the resolution of point cloud data and is agnostic to plant species and sensor types.

Result: KDSS successfully integrates with state-of-the-art segmentation models, providing satisfying results across multiple sensor types (e.g., LiDAR) and plant species.

Conclusion: KDSS is a versatile, resolution-preserving alternative to conventional pre-processing and down-sampling, enhancing point cloud segmentation for diverse use cases.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

### [160] [Background Prompt for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21055)
*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Mambo,' a foreground-background decomposition framework for improved few-shot out-of-distribution detection, addressing robustness issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges such as low robustness due to reliance on local class similarity and fixed background extraction strategies.

Method: Mambo combines background prompt learning with background refinement via local class similarity, alongside patch self-calibrated tuning to address sample diversity and flexible background patch selection.

Result: Experiments revealed that Mambo surpasses state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection and near OOD detection settings on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Mambo offers a robust solution to FS-OOD detection challenges with superior performance over SOTA methods, and its source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

### [161] [Stratify or Die: Rethinking Data Splits in Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21056)
*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods, Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), to address dataset splitting challenges in image segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the issue of unrepresentative test sets and biased evaluations in segmentation tasks caused by random dataset splitting. Traditional stratification methods for classification do not adapt well due to the multi-label and imbalanced nature of segmentation datasets.

Method: The authors developed IPS, a simple label-aware sampling method, and WDES, a genetic algorithm that minimizes the Wasserstein distance for improved dataset stratification. WDES is mathematically proven to be globally optimal over sufficient generations.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative and unbiased dataset splits compared to random sampling, which is validated using new heterogeneity metrics across various segmentation domains. It also leads to lower performance variance in model evaluation.

Conclusion: WDES is especially beneficial for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets in segmentation tasks, providing an effective alternative to conventional splitting strategies while ensuring more accurate evaluations.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

### [162] [EnGraf-Net: Multiple Granularity Branch Network with Fine-Coarse Graft Grained for Classification Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21061)
*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-grained classification models focus on fine details between similar classes. The authors propose EnGraf-Net, which uses semantic associations structured as a taxonomy to improve classification without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current fine-grained classification methods, which often rely on manual annotations or automatic cropping techniques that can miss critical local features.

Method: The paper introduces EnGraf-Net, a deep neural network that incorporates semantic hierarchies (taxonomies) as supervised learning signals for fine-grained classification.

Result: EnGraf-Net outperforms many existing models on the CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets and achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: EnGraf-Net proves effective for fine-grained classification, eliminating the need for manual annotations or cropping techniques while leveraging semantic associations as structured supervision.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

*Kasper Cools,Clara Maathuis,Alexander M. van Oers,Claudia S. Hübner,Nikos Deligiannis,Marijke Vandewal,Geert De Cubber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial patch attacks, revealing varied attack success rates and highlighting cross-architectural transferability from CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the security risks in machine learning systems, focusing on the susceptibility of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial attacks, despite their robustness and superior performance compared to CNNs.

Method: The authors designed adversarial patches using the Creases Transformation (CT), which introduces subtle distortions to manipulate ViT-based person vs. non-person classification. They evaluated the attack's effectiveness on four ViT models.

Result: Experimental results showed attack success rates varying widely, from 40.04% to 99.97%, demonstrating that ViTs have differing vulnerabilities to adversarial patches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the cross-architectural vulnerability of ViTs to adversarial attacks and emphasizes the role of pre-training datasets in determining model resilience.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer is an architecture for controllable video concept transfer, introducing spatial and timestep decomposition. It outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing key video components and improving editability.

Method: The method involves spatial decomposition of videos, a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture, a self-supervised pretraining strategy, and Chain-of-Prompt for timestep decomposition guided by LLMs.

Result: UniTransfer demonstrates superior quality in video concept transfer across various scenes and images compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: UniTransfer provides a cutting-edge approach to video concept transfer, achieving high-quality results and enhanced control through novel architectural and decomposition techniques.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

*Ziang Yan,Xinhao Li,Yinan He,Zhengrong Yue,Xiangyu Zeng,Yali Wang,Yu Qiao,Limin Wang,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VTTS, a method for enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reasoning capabilities through iterative perception during inference, showing substantial performance gains across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to improve human-level perception and understanding in MLLMs by addressing limitations in static perception methods that hinder reasoning.

Method: The method, Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), incorporates an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism and reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision to refine attention hierarchically during inference. Additionally, the VTTS-80K dataset is introduced to support this iterative perception paradigm.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated significant performance improvements, with the Videochat-R1.5 model outperforming strong baselines by over 5% across 15+ benchmarks in areas like video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Conclusion: VTTS provides an innovative framework for improving reasoning in MLLMs by enhancing perceptual compute, validated through robust experiments and generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mammo-CLIP Dissect, a framework to analyze textual concepts learned by deep learning models in mammography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the textual reasoning behind deep learning models for safe AI deployment in clinical settings, especially mammography.

Method: Mammo-CLIP Dissect labels CNN neurons with textual concepts and evaluates alignment to domain knowledge, leveraging a vision-language model specific to mammography.

Result: Models trained on mammography data align better with clinical workflows and capture more relevant concepts, while fine-tuning impacts concept specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect reveals how domain-specific training shapes concept learning, offering insights for enhancing AI explainability in mammography tasks.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the process inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) during video reasoning tasks, which affects their interpretability and robustness.

Method: Development of MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework utilizing a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based reward to align reasoning traces with grounded video references. The creation of MOSS-Video, a benchmark for training and evaluation in video reasoning.

Result: MOSS-ChatV achieved 87.2% performance on the MOSS-Video (test) benchmark and improved metrics on other video benchmarks like MVBench and MMVU. It consistently enhances reasoning performance across various architectures.

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV improves reasoning trace consistency and applies broadly across architectures, showing potential for robust video reasoning. Evaluations confirm its superior stability and interpretability compared to alternatives.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

*Guojun Lei,Chi Wang,Yikai Wang,Hong Li,Ying Song,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating consistent and generalizable videos guided by camera trajectories, proposing an approach integrating camera and object motion through pixel motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often struggle with integrating camera and object motions, leading to inaccuracies in relative motion representation. This paper aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The approach uses a stable diffusion network to learn reference motion maps based on camera trajectories, combined with semantic object priors for input into an image-to-video network.

Result: The proposed model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in video generation, as verified by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Combining camera and object motion into pixel-based motion maps is an effective method to generate consistent and accurate videos guided by camera trajectories.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: This paper explores how data dimensionality and complexity impact the ability of discriminators to differentiate synthetic from real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of discriminators in detecting synthetic images in an era of advancing generative AI technology.

Method: Analysis based on data dimensionality and Kolmogorov complexity to measure dataset structure and study its effects on generator-discriminator dynamics.

Result: Simple and highly complex datasets make detection difficult, while intermediate-complexity datasets favor discriminators due to visible errors in generators.

Conclusion: Discriminator performance is optimized with datasets of intermediate complexity, while extremes in simplicity or complexity pose challenges for distinguishing synthetic images.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

TL;DR: WAVECLIP introduces a wavelet-based tokenization approach for CLIP models, enabling adaptive resolution inference and computational efficiency during zero-shot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP lack mechanisms for adaptive resolution processing, limiting their efficiency and flexibility in varied compute-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: The paper replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, leveraging key-value caching and causal cross-level attention. Lightweight distillation is used from a frozen CLIP teacher for training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate competitive accuracy in zero-shot classification while offering significant computational savings due to adaptive resolution inference.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP supports dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs via confidence-based gating and early exits, requiring only lightweight modifications to existing models.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

### [171] [Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173)
*Aymen Bouguerra,Daniel Montoya,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez,Chokri Mraidha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of quantization on CLIP, a vision-language model, focusing on accuracy, reliability, and out-of-distribution detection, uncovering unexpected findings about its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to examine overlooked aspects like quantization's impact on CLIP's reliability metrics, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection beyond its accuracy.

Method: The study involves large-scale evaluations of CLIP's performance with quantization, applying quantization-aware training techniques and analyzing calibration and reliability metrics.

Result: Quantization inconsistently influences calibration, improving underconfident models but degrading overconfident ones while enhancing other metrics like out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: Quantization transcends the traditional efficiency-performance trade-off by enabling improvements in accuracy, calibration, and robustness, thus guiding the deployment of efficient and robust vision-language models.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,Shayan Baghayi Nejad,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models and proposes CARINOX, a framework that improves text-image alignment using optimized rewards and combined strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable Diffusion and similar models struggle with compositional alignment, especially when generating images based on complex prompts.

Method: CARINOX combines noise optimization and exploration with an optimized selection of reward metrics grounded in human judgment correlation.

Result: CARINOX improved text-image alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, surpassing other optimization and exploration methods.

Conclusion: CARINOX effectively enhances compositional alignment while maintaining image quality, establishing itself as an advancement over existing text-to-image alignment methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET is a large-scale dataset with 4 million examples designed to improve visual table understanding (VTU) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current VTU benchmarks, which rely on synthetic table renderings and lack extensive access to real-world visual complexity.

Method: The paper introduces TABLET, a dataset composed of paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information, based on 2 million unique tables.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on VTU tasks and robustness with real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET provides a unified dataset that preserves original visualizations and enables robust training and extensible evaluation for future VTU models.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

### [174] [Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21209)
*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conformal prediction-based approach to create robust and controlled feature attribution explanations for image-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explanations for image-based model predictions often lack robustness and may not represent the true reasoning of the model.

Method: The authors developed a conformal prediction-based approach that controls explanation fidelity by identifying essential feature subsets without requiring ground-truth calibration.

Result: Empirical evaluations across image datasets show that their method (FastSHAP) achieves better fidelity and smaller explanation regions than competing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances faithfulness and efficiency in feature attribution explanations, with super-pixel based conformity measures performing better than pixel-wise ones.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sigma, a skeleton-based SLU framework addressing limitations in semantic grounding, context balance, and cross-modal learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was driven by limitations in current SLU methods, including weak semantic grounding, imbalance between local and global context focus, and inefficient cross-modal learning.

Method: The Sigma framework incorporates a sign-aware early fusion mechanism for modality interaction, a hierarchical alignment strategy for fine and high-level feature alignment, and a unified pre-training framework combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Sigma attained state-of-the-art performance in various SLU benchmarks covering different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: The proposed Sigma framework enhances SLU by leveraging semantically informative pre-training and skeletal data, highlighting its robustness and generalizability across tasks.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well automated metrics align with human judgment for compositional text-image generation tasks, finding that no single metric consistently performs well across various challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring that text-image generation outputs truly reflect human preferences, rather than relying on popular or conventional metrics.

Method: A broad study analyzing various widely used metrics for text-image generation through correlation and behavioral experiments across diverse compositional problems.

Result: No metric performs uniformly across all text-image compositional tasks, with VQA-based metrics and embedding-based metrics each showing strengths and weaknesses depending on the problem.

Conclusion: Transparent and careful selection of evaluation metrics is crucial for reliable outcomes in assessing text-image generation, as well as their application in reward models.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

*Shakib Khan,Fariba Dambandkhameneh,Nazim Shaikh,Yao Nie,Raghavan Venugopal,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlideMamba, a deep learning framework integrating Mamba architecture and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), designed to improve Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology. It surpasses existing methods in predictive tasks such as gene fusion and mutation identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis for clinical and biological tasks by addressing challenges in capturing both local and global spatial relationships within digital pathology data.

Method: The method combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies and GNNs for fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. An entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy integrates these signals dynamically to improve prediction performance.

Result: SlideMamba achieved PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming other models such as MIL, Trans-MIL, Mamba-only, GNN-only, and GAT-Mamba. It also delivered competitive results in ROC AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.

Conclusion: SlideMamba's integrated architecture, along with its adaptive fusion strategy, demonstrates strong potential for advancing spatially-resolved predictive modeling in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a novel 3D asset generation framework that integrates multiple control modalities like point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal poses for fine-grained control. It uses a unified model architecture and a difficulty-aware training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing 3D generative methods rely heavily on image or text conditioning, which limits their practical use due to lack of detailed controllability.

Method: Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts diverse inputs such as images, point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal poses; it uses a unified model to fuse all modalities and trains with difficulty-aware sampling to handle missing inputs and hard control signals.

Result: The methodology improves generation precision, supports geometry-aware transformations, and offers enhanced robustness in practical workflows.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni addresses the limitations in 3D asset generation by offering cross-modal controllability and robust multi-modal input handling, making it highly suitable for production environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach to improve CNN predictions by aligning model attention with semantic maps generated by vision-language models, avoiding manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations, raising a question of whether they make predictions for correct reasons. Cognitive science-inspired methods often require labor-intensive annotations, creating a need for scalable solutions.

Method: The authors propose a framework that utilizes vision-language models for automatic generation of semantic attention maps with natural language prompts. An auxiliary loss is introduced to align CNN attention with these maps.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ColoredMNIST and performs competitively against annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST. It enhances generalization, reduces shortcut reliance, and aligns model attention with human intuition.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable solution for improving CNNs' cognitive plausibility and generalization without requiring expert annotations, making it effective and practical.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Decipher-MR serves as a versatile and scalable foundation for MRI-based AI, enabling efficient development of clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen

diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for

TL;DR: The paper introduces SQ-InstructBLIP, a method that iteratively generates image-aware sub-questions and sub-answers to enhance reasoning performance in visual question answering (VQA) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language understanding struggles with multi-step reasoning, especially because traditional large language models cannot access detailed visual information or provide transparent internal mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method, SQ-InstructBLIP, integrates a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner to iteratively create sub-questions and sub-answers that are informed by image content. These components share the same architecture and work collaboratively to address the main question.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SQ-InstructBLIP delivers more accurate reasoning and superior performance compared to prior methods on VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The SQ-InstructBLIP framework effectively addresses limitations in vision-language understanding by introducing image-aware iterative questioning and reasoning components.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

TL;DR: The paper defines hallucination in text-to-image (T2I) generative models as bias-driven deviations and introduces a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear framework for evaluating hallucination in T2I models, as existing studies focus only on prompt alignment and overlook generated content beyond the prompt.

Method: The authors propose defining T2I hallucination with a taxonomy that includes three types: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations, establishing a structured framework to assess hidden biases and deviations.

Result: The proposed framework defines an upper evaluation bound and uncovers biases in T2I generative models, facilitating richer assessment methods.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding and assessment of hallucinatory behaviors in T2I models by introducing a comprehensive framework and taxonomy for evaluating bias-driven deviations.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for person-independent micro-action recognition, enhancing robustness against inter-person variability using advanced feature and loss-level optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to how the same action can appear differently across individuals, making it hard to generalize effectively.

Method: The proposed framework employs two main components: a Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module at the feature level and a Group-Invariant Regularized Loss at the loss level. The former stabilizes dynamics using a dual-branch system for temporal and frequency adjustments, while the latter simulates unseen person-specific variations to improve generalization.

Result: Experiments on the MA-52 dataset show that the framework exceeds prior methods in accuracy and robustness, offering stable performance under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The study successfully delivers a person-agnostic micro-action recognition framework, proving its adaptability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios through extensive evaluation.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Method: The authors adapt VGGT for semantic matching using feature fine-tuning, a semantic head, cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training strategies.

Result: Experiments show improved geometry awareness, reliability, and manifold preservation, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively overcomes challenges in semantic matching and enhances correspondence mechanisms, demonstrating its practical benefits.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

### [185] [MedVSR: Medical Video Super-Resolution with Cross State-Space Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21265)
*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR is a novel framework addressing challenges in video super-resolution for medical imaging, showing superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution medical videos hinder accurate diagnoses due to hardware and physiological constraints, and existing VSR models introduce artifacts and misalignments.

Method: The MedVSR framework utilizes Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for artifact reduction and enhanced feature learning.

Result: MedVSR demonstrated significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and efficiency across four datasets in diverse medical contexts.

Conclusion: MedVSR offers a specialized solution for enhancing low-resolution medical videos, outperforming current models and contributing to better diagnosis support.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

### [186] [MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268)
*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses major challenges in multimodal reasoning models: lack of quality chain-of-thought data and unstable reinforcement learning fine-tuning. It introduces Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), releases curated datasets, and open-sources models and resources to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in current multimodal reasoning models, specifically the shortage of long chain-of-thought data and instability in reinforcement learning fine-tuning methods.

Method: The authors introduce Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) to stabilize policy optimization. They also release extensive datasets and open-source multimodal models for community use.

Result: The proposed VAS strategy and curated datasets enhanced performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental and theoretical analyses validated the effectiveness of their approach.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that stabilizing reward variance through VAS improves reinforcement learning fine-tuning, while curated datasets and open-source standards promote advancement in multimodal reasoning models.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pre-trained AI Foundation Model, Prithvi-EO, for marine monitoring tasks using ocean observation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labelled data in ocean science are scarce and expensive, requiring innovative solutions for effective analysis of marine ecosystems.

Method: A Vision Transformer architecture (Prithvi-EO) pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data, followed by fine-tuning on two marine earth observation tasks.

Result: The model improves upon conventional methods for predicting chlorophyll concentration and refining remote sensing estimates of ocean primary production.

Conclusion: Foundation models are promising tools for ocean monitoring, leveraging limited labelled data to provide detailed spatial patterns and insights into climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

*Shilin Lu,Zhuming Lian,Zihan Zhou,Shaocong Zhang,Chen Zhao,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for seamless and high-quality image composition by addressing challenges like lighting complexities and resolution issues without resorting to latent inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image composition models have limitations, such as handling complex lighting conditions and diverse high-resolutions, and existing text-to-image diffusion models lack a robust framework to overcome these challenges effectively.

Method: The SHINE framework employs manifold-steered anchor loss with pretrained customization adapters, degradation-suppression guidance, and adaptive background blending techniques to enable high-fidelity object insertions.

Result: SHINE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the newly proposed ComplexCompo benchmark and standard evaluation metrics, achieving superior results in image composition.

Conclusion: SHINE addresses limitations in current image composition methods by leveraging pretrained models and novel loss/guidance techniques for accurate, seamless, and high-quality object insertion across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), called QuantVGGT, effectively addressing challenges of activation distribution and calibration sampling in compressed 3D reconstruction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in compressing billion-scale VGGTs, particularly heavy-tailed activation distributions and unstable calibration sampling, which hinder real-world deployment due to high computational and memory costs.

Method: The framework employs Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, combining Hadamard rotation and channel smoothing, and Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling for robust calibration clustering. These techniques address activation distribution and sampling instability issues.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, significantly reducing memory usage (3.7×) and inference time (2.5×) in hardware, while maintaining over 98% reconstruction accuracy compared to full-precision models.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT is highly practical for resource-constrained scenarios and offers substantial performance gains, advancing the feasibility of VGGTs in memory and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

*Yu Yuan,Xijun Wang,Tharindu Wickremasinghe,Zeeshan Nadir,Bole Ma,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen addresses physical inconsistency and lack of control in text-to-video generation by incorporating learnable physical principles to achieve realistic Newtonian dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models lack physical consistency and effective control, leading to unrealistic motions and imprecise dynamic generation.

Method: The paper introduces NewtonGen, a framework using Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) to learn physical principles alongside data-driven synthesis for consistent and controllable video generation.

Result: NewtonGen successfully integrates physics-based constraints into video generation, leading to improved realism and precise parameter control.

Conclusion: NewtonGen demonstrates that combining physical principles with data-driven approaches enhances text-to-video generation in terms of realism and controllability.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality generative AI on accessible consumer hardware without relying on computationally heavy models.

Method: Utilizes novel "timestep sharing" and "split-timestep fine-tuning" techniques, along with pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and quantization for efficient distillation of rectified flow models.

Result: The framework achieves rapid image generation, memory-efficient operations across various hardware, and outperforms existing few-step methods through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: SD3.5-Flash democratizes advanced image-generative AI by making it accessible for deployment on a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discuss the importance of robust, accurate, and fair medical imaging datasets for healthcare applications and identify limitations in current practices for publicly shared datasets.

Method: Conduct an analytical comparison of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, focusing on documentation, licensing, storage, metadata, and maintenance practices.

Result: Identified issues include vague licenses, poor documentation, lack of persistent identifiers, duplication in datasets, and missing metadata, indicating gaps in CCP governance models.

Conclusion: Improving governance, documentation, and responsible curation practices for medical imaging datasets on CCPs is essential to prevent potential harm and improve healthcare AI outcomes.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

*Skyler Ruiter,Jiannan Tian,Fengguang Song*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces FZModules, a framework for creating efficient, custom lossy compression pipelines tailored to specific scientific datasets, balancing high throughput and rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High data volumes from scientific simulations overwhelm memory and storage, demanding efficient compression techniques. Existing solutions either require expertise, sacrifice performance, or lack adaptability.

Method: The authors developed FZModules, which integrates high-performance modules into customizable error-bounded compression pipelines. It uses an asynchronous library for managing data dependencies, memory movement, and concurrency.

Result: FZModules demonstrated competitive end-to-end speedup with GPU compressors, matched CPU compressors in rate-distortion, and facilitated the rapid development of tailored solutions across multiple scientific datasets.

Conclusion: FZModules achieves a balance between high throughput and fidelity, enabling scalable, domain-specific design for scientific data compression.

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the rising need to deploy GenAI workloads effectively within HPC environments, which traditionally lack the cloud-oriented infrastructure these workloads demand.

Method: The authors used a converged computing architecture combining Kubernetes and HPC platforms to deploy and run containerized GenAI applications, specifically demonstrating this with the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM).

Result: The study successfully deployed containerized GenAI workloads on HPC systems, emphasizing reproducibility and highlighting opportunities for the HPC container community.

Conclusion: The integration of HPC and Kubernetes for GenAI workloads is feasible and opens pathways for further research in tools and methods to optimize such deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse matrix operations like permutation, extraction, and assignment are critical for applications in load balancing, matrix reordering, and graph processing, but existing solutions are limited in scalability and performance.

Method: The authors propose an Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy for sparse matrix operations combined with synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms for local computations.

Result: The developed algorithms reduce communication overhead, outperform libraries like CombBLAS and PETSc, and demonstrate versatility across various application scenarios on systems including university clusters and the Perlmutter supercomputer.

Conclusion: The paper provides efficient algorithms and implementations that significantly improve performance in sparse matrix operations while reducing communication costs, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HPC launchers like Slurm's srun face performance limitations in handling dynamic and heterogeneous workloads involving AI and HPC tasks.

Method: RADICAL-Pilot is integrated with Flux and Dragon runtime systems, and its performance is evaluated using synthetic and real-world workloads on Frontier HPC systems.

Result: RP+Flux achieves up to 930 tasks/s, while RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with 99.6% utilization. These provide significantly better throughput and utilization compared to srun.

Conclusion: The integration of RP with Flux and Dragon enables scalable and efficient execution of hybrid AI-HPC workloads, substantially outperforming existing solutions like srun.

Abstract: Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes the "tail batching" strategy to effectively reduce GPU idle time in reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs), speeding up training significantly without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from GPU underutilization caused by imbalanced response lengths during rollout steps. Existing techniques that relax synchronization often compromise training accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces "tail batching," a strategy that separates long-tail response rollouts into a smaller number of designated long rollout rounds, while ensuring short rollout rounds involve only balanced, short responses. This is paired with a system called RollPacker, which optimizes elastic parallelism adaptation, dynamic resource allocation, and stream-based training.

Result: The proposed RollPacker system reduces end-to-end RL training time by 2.03x-2.56x compared to veRL and up to 2.24x compared to RLHFuse when applied to the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: Tail batching and the RollPacker system significantly accelerate RL post-training while maintaining training accuracy, addressing a major bottleneck in synchronous RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5
family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

Result: Achieved a 5.1x speedup in the GPU section and a 3.3x speedup in the overall assembly process. Acceleration becomes feasible after only 10 iterations.

Conclusion: Leveraging input matrix sparsity can significantly enhance GPU performance in assembling Schur complement matrices, which is efficient for iterative solvers.

Abstract: Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10
iterations.

*William F. Godoy,Tatiana Melnichenko,Pedro Valero-Lara,Wael Elwasif,Philip Fackler,Rafael Ferreira Da Silva,Keita Teranishi,Jeffrey S. Vetter*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance and portability of Mojo, a new programming language for scientific computing on GPUs, showing competitive results with CUDA and HIP but noting gaps in specific use cases and GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance and productivity limitations in scientific computing, combining the simplicity of Python with efficient GPU programming capabilities.

Method: Mojo was tested on four scientific workloads and compared to CUDA and HIP baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs.

Result: Mojo demonstrated competitive performance for memory-bound tasks but revealed gaps for atomic operations and compute-bound tasks with fast math, especially on AMD GPUs.

Conclusion: Mojo shows promise in bridging gaps in the Python ecosystem for scientific computing and AI, though its programming approach still remains low-level.

Abstract: We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

### [200] [From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137)
*Huynh Q. N. Vo,Md Tawsif Rahman Chowdhury,Paritosh Ramanan,Gozde Tutuncuoglu,Junchi Yang,Feng Qiu,Murat Yildirim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method tailored for RRAM arrays, achieving significant energy and latency savings for solving large-scale linear programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional architectures face fundamental limits in handling the growing computational workloads, prompting the exploration of in-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM to overcome energy and latency constraints.

Method: The paper proposes a PDHG method co-designed for RRAM arrays, minimizes write cycles, ensures robustness against device imperfections, and employs a symmetric block-matrix structure for distributed crossbar operations. It uses MELISO+ simulations for evaluations under realistic conditions.

Result: The RRAM-based solver matches GPU-accelerated solver accuracy while reducing energy consumption and latency by up to three orders of magnitude in benchmarking tests.

Conclusion: This PDHG-based RRAM solver showcases the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for large-scale optimization through distributed IMC.

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

### [201] [Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21275)
*Shiju Wang,Yujie Wang,Ao Sun,Fangcheng Fu,Zijian Zhu,Bin Cui,Xu Han,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) and a training system named InfiniPipe to improve long-context training efficiency for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipeline parallelism schemes cannot effectively balance resource usage and workload for long-sequence training due to trade-offs in partitioning granularity and skewed sequence length distributions.

Method: The authors propose EPP, which dynamically combines token-level and batch-level pipeline parallelism, and implement InfiniPipe, a system using resource-aware sequence processing and a stage-aware checkpointing mechanism.

Result: Experiments show that InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup compared to state-of-the-art distributed training systems.

Conclusion: Using EPP and InfiniPipe enables more efficient and balanced long-sequence processing, achieving significant performance improvement in distributed training systems.

Abstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-inspired framework for efficient learning, deriving well-known algorithms using the concept of least action principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a learning system that processes information in the least time and achieves low error with minimal observations.

Method: The authors employ least action principles from physics to derive learning algorithms through the concept of a Learning Lagrangian, calculating stationary trajectories.

Result: Classic algorithms, such as Bellman's optimality equation and the Adam optimizer, are derived as examples of stationary paths in the Learning Lagrangian.

Conclusion: The study highlights a novel approach to unify and derive learning algorithms by applying physical principles, emphasizing efficiency in the learning process.

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

### [203] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sig2Model, a learned index for databases that addresses high retraining costs and degraded performance under dynamic updates, drastically improving throughput and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned indexes struggle with maintaining efficiency during dynamic data updates, as they require global retraining of models which blocks queries and reduces performance metrics like queries-per-second (QPS), making existing solutions impractical for real-world use.

Method: Sig2Model employs three techniques: sigmoid boosting to approximate data distribution shifts with localized sigmoid functions, proactive update training to strategically allocate placeholders in high-update regions using Gaussian mixture models, and a neural joint optimization framework for continuous refinement of parameters.

Result: Experiments show that Sig2Model reduces retraining costs by up to 20x, improves QPS by up to 3x, and decreases memory usage by up to 1000x compared to current updatable learned indexes.

Conclusion: Sig2Model demonstrates significant advancements in efficiency and adaptability for dynamic workloads, making it a strong contender for real-world database indexing tasks.

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends generative flow networks to the multi-agent setting by proposing a theoretical framework and four associated algorithms, which show superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A theoretical framework for extending generative flow networks (GFNs) to multi-agent systems, enabling collaborative object generation, was missing.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) and designs four algorithms for centralized, decentralized, and hybrid training and execution.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework is theoretically robust and demonstrates practical efficacy in generating objects collaboratively in a multi-agent setting.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle introduces a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter to improve generation speed, outperforming previous methods like EAGLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drafting methods require sequential passes, which slow down the generation process. FastEagle aims to replace sequential decoding steps with a faster, error-mitigating cascaded approach.

Method: FastEagle utilizes a single forward pass as its non-autoregressive cascaded drafting mechanism, accompanied by layer-wise supervision and constrained draft trees for error reduction and verification.

Result: FastEagle achieves faster generation speeds compared to autoregressive drafters like EAGLE-3 with competitive acceptance behavior across multiple LLMs and tasks.

Conclusion: Non-sequential drafting approaches, like FastEagle, are a viable method for accelerating lossless LLM inference without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast machine learning model to improve ozone representation in climate models, enabling better climate sensitivity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current climate models lack interactive ozone representations due to the high computational cost of atmospheric chemistry schemes.

Method: The paper presents mloz, a machine learning parameterization leveraging atmospheric temperature profiles to model ozone variability and trends across multiple layers of the atmosphere.

Result: mloz achieves stable and reliable ozone predictions 31 times faster than traditional methods while significantly reducing climate model runtimes. It demonstrates transferability across UKESM and ICON models.

Conclusion: mloz shows potential for broad adoption in climate models lacking interactive chemistry, improving insights for future climate change assessments.

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

*Kay Fuhrmeister,Arne Pelzer,Fabian Radke,Julia Lechinger,Mahzad Gharleghi,Thomas Köllmer,Insa Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses EEG data privacy concerns by proposing a transformer-based autoencoder for anonymization, ensuring reduced re-identification potential while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increased availability of EEG consumer devices, user privacy concerns arise from their potential for re-identification and sensitive information leakage.

Method: The authors introduce a transformer-based autoencoder to anonymize EEG data, making it challenging to re-identify subjects while retaining its application-specific utility.

Result: Anonymized EEG data via the proposed method shows significantly reduced re-identifiability while maintaining its utility for tasks such as sleep staging.

Conclusion: The study concludes that EEG data privacy can be effectively safeguarded using the proposed anonymization technique without compromising its machine learning utility.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the vulnerability of memorization-based influence estimation tools to adversarial manipulations, presenting both empirical and theoretical findings to demonstrate how these scores can be exploited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether widely-used influence estimation tools, which are crucial for understanding model behavior and informing dataset curation, are susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly in critical applications like data valuation and responsible machine learning.

Method: The authors propose an attack method based on calculating the pseudoinverse of the input, which requires only black-box access to the model's outputs. This approach is validated empirically across various image classification tasks and supported by theoretical analysis regarding the instability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations.

Result: Findings show that both state-of-the-art influence estimation proxies are vulnerable to targeted manipulations. The results also reveal conditions under which influence scores can be inherently fragile.

Conclusion: The study identifies significant weaknesses in influence-based attribution tools and emphasizes the necessity for developing robust defenses against adversarial manipulation.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified approach to goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) by combining contrastive learning and quasimetric representations to improve performance on challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing GCRL methods, which either struggle with stability and long-term planning (contrastive methods) or with noisy, high-dimensional environments (quasimetric methods).

Method: The paper introduces a unified approach leveraging the quasimetric representation structure along with additional constraints to learn goal-reaching successor representations, applicable even in suboptimal and stochastic environments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms contrastive and quasimetric approaches in offline GCRL benchmarks, particularly in stitching tasks and noisy, high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The unified approach successfully combines the strengths of contrastive RL and quasimetric networks, offering a robust solution for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced deep-learning framework for processing EEG signals to extract biologically meaningful patterns, filter noise, and achieve better generalization for applications in CNS disorders, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in extracting features from noisy and variable EEG channels to improve understanding of brain states, aiding drug development and CNS disorder diagnosis.

Method: The approach combines multi-scale frequency encoder, attention mechanism for EEG channels, a gating network to filter noise, and a loss function using supervised and contrastive learning.

Result: The framework demonstrated successful classification across CNS treatments and diseases, as well as robust generalization across species and channel conditions.

Conclusion: The novel end-to-end framework can reliably process EEG signals, select informative channels, and provide generalizable outcomes applicable to neuroscience advancements and diagnostics.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE introduces a clustering method that integrates domain-specific rules directly into a Variational Autoencoder for more meaningful and interpretable clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional clustering techniques in capturing structural or semantic constraints in data-intensive, rule-driven domains.

Method: Extends Variational Autoencoder architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data-driven features into a unified latent space, with penalty mechanisms to enforce rule compliance.

Result: Improved clustering performance, such as better differentiation of UAVs, stealth aircraft, SUVs, and sedans, with enhanced interpretability and domain-specific validity.

Conclusion: Constraint-guided multimodal clustering effectively combines learned representations with domain rules, leading to insightful clustering outcomes despite challenges like rule conflicts and computational complexities.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attention algorithm that combines sparsity and recurrent dependence, focusing on efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational and memory inefficiency in attention layers, which scale quadratically with sequence length without structural optimization.

Method: The approach involves an innovative algorithm leveraging the inversion of tree-structured matrices to combine sparsity and recurrent dependence in attention mechanisms.

Result: The proposed method balances efficiency and flexibility in sequence-to-sequence mappings, overcoming disadvantages of previous sparsity-based and recurrent-dependent approaches.

Conclusion: The novel algorithm improves the scalability of attention layers while maintaining high performance by integrating tree-structured matrix inversion.

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Conclusion: The dual-network model can guide concrete mix optimization while lowering computational intensity and improving understanding of damage progression and mechanical behavior.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

### [214] [Guiding Application Users via Estimation of Computational Resources for Massively Parallel Chemistry Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20667)
*Tanzila Tabassum,Omer Subasi,Ajay Panyala,Epiya Ebiapia,Gerald Baumgartner,Erdal Mutlu,P.,Sadayappan,Karol Kowalski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents machine learning strategies to predict computational resources for chemistry simulations and optimize runtime parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massively parallel chemistry computations require expensive supercomputing resources, and guiding users on efficient resource usage is critical.

Method: The authors use Gradient Boosting models and active learning approaches to predict execution time and optimize runtime parameters based on collected data.

Result: Gradient Boosting achieved high accuracy, with MAPE values of 0.023 for Aurora and 0.073 for Frontier. Active learning approaches achieved a MAPE of 0.2 with limited data points.

Conclusion: ML techniques can effectively optimize computational resource usage for chemistry simulations on supercomputers, enabling cost-efficient and faster executions.

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

### [215] [Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20509)
*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), which replaces the entropy bonus in policy gradient methods with a complexity bonus. CDPO encourages policies balancing exploration and structure, yielding more effective learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of entropy maximization in policy gradient methods, which can lead to inefficient, unstructured exploration by pushing policies towards a uniform random distribution.

Method: The method replaces the entropy bonus with a complexity bonus, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium. This fosters structured, balanced exploration and leads to the proposed CDPO framework, which is implemented and benchmarked starting from PPO.

Result: CDPO demonstrates better robustness to the choice of regularization coefficients than PPO, especially in tasks demanding greater exploration, and showcases improved performance across discrete action space tasks.

Conclusion: The complexity-based regularization in CDPO encourages the emergence of structured policies, suppresses extremes of disorder and order, and aligns well with exploration needs, making it an effective alternative to entropy-based methods.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical framework to analyze deterministic diffusion-based inversion algorithms by linking them to generalized projected gradient descent, including proven recovery guarantees under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous recovery guarantees in the use of generative diffusion models for high-dimensional signal recovery in inverse problems.

Method: The authors analyze deterministic diffusion methods, focusing on connections to projected gradient descent and providing convergence rates based on restricted isometry properties of the sensing matrix.

Result: The framework demonstrates convergence rates for low-dimensional data distributions such as compact convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixtures, even achieving global guarantees in nonconvex cases.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based methods for inverse problems can be rigorously analyzed and connected to gradient descent techniques, offering convergence insights and reliability under structured conditions.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

### [217] [The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574)
*Scott Koermer,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of hyperparameter choices on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for improving predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive modeling often requires accurate uncertainty quantification to identify risks such as model extrapolation or insufficient data. BNNs offer potential for robust UQ, but they are hampered by challenges such as hyperparameter tuning and approximations during training.

Method: The authors use global sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of various hyperparameter configurations on the performance of BNNs, considering both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The study reveals significant interactions among hyperparameters, demonstrating that these configurations strongly affect predictive accuracy and UQ quality in BNNs.

Conclusion: Global sensitivity analysis or methods like Bayesian optimization should be employed to reduce dimensionality and optimize hyperparameters, ensuring reliable uncertainty quantification in real-world BNN applications.

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

*Amirmohammad Ziaei Bideh,Aleksandra Georgievska,Jonathan Gryak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBench, a benchmark for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems, comparing 12 algorithms on 14 PDEs and 63 ODEs under different noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models, enabling better understanding and progress in model discovery methods.

Method: The authors developed MDBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates algorithms on ODEs and PDEs using metrics like derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity.

Result: Linear methods and genetic programming achieve the best prediction accuracy for PDEs and ODEs, respectively, while linear models exhibit better noise robustness. Current methods face limitations in handling complex PDE systems.

Conclusion: MDBench provides a rigorous and diverse framework for systematically evaluating and improving model discovery methods in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Bart Cox,Jérémie Decouchant,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GWTF is a decentralized framework for training large language models (LLMs) across heterogeneous clients, addressing issues like node churn and unstable networks, and achieving up to 45% faster training in diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of large language models and the need to democratize their training, leveraging resources from heterogeneous clients voluntarily.

Method: A novel decentralized flow algorithm to enable efficient collaborative training of LLMs, even with node churn and network instabilities.

Result: Extensive evaluation on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models shows a 45% reduction in training time in challenging, realistic scenarios with high heterogeneity and node churn.

Conclusion: GWTF establishes a practical approach to decentralized large language model training, making it efficient, resilient, and accessible to diverse client environments.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

### [220] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RNPC, a robust neural probabilistic circuit that addresses adversarial attacks in Neural Probabilistic Circuits, offering improved robustness and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the vulnerability of Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) to adversarial attacks, which exploit the attribute recognition model to compromise predictions.

Method: The authors propose RNPC, which integrates outputs from the attribute recognition model and probabilistic circuit using class-wise integration to enhance adversarial robustness.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show that RNPC improves adversarial robustness while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs, outperforming NPCs and other concept bottleneck models.

Conclusion: RNPC represents a significant improvement over NPCs by combining interpretability, high performance, and enhanced adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SuperOffload, an optimized system for training large language models on next-gen Superchips, achieving significantly higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of Superchips with tightly coupled CPU-GPU architecture offers unprecedented computational power, but there is limited research on their impact on LLM training.

Method: The authors propose SuperOffload, leveraging techniques like adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, speculative execution, and a Superchip-optimized Adam optimizer to efficiently use Superchip resources.

Result: SuperOffload achieves up to 2.5x throughput improvement over current systems, enabling training of 25B models on a single GH200 Superchip, and scaling to 13B models with 1 million token length on 8 GH200 units.

Conclusion: SuperOffload demonstrates that tailored optimizations for Superchips can significantly enhance LLM training throughput and scalability, showcasing the potential of this architecture.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of OT, to improve class preservation and meaningful data alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OT alignments often fail to account for intrinsic coherence and symmetry in data.

Method: The study uses group Fourier invariants, specifically bispectrum, to incorporate symmetry awareness into OT.

Result: Bispectral OT provides improved class preservation and generates correspondence that aligns with semantic label structures within datasets.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT improves upon traditional OT by addressing symmetry and coherence, making it more effective in capturing meaningful correspondences.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates hybrid classifiers for diabetes risk stratification, finding XGB-RF to outperform SVM-LR on both internal and external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing global diabetes burden by improving early risk stratification through machine learning methods.

Method: Two hybrid machine learning models, XGB-RF and SVM-LR, were developed and tested using a standardized pipeline. They were evaluated on internal and external datasets using metrics like AUROC, AUPRC, and calibration measures.

Result: XGB-RF consistently outperformed SVM-LR in both internal and external datasets in terms of AUROC, AUPRC, and other performance metrics.

Conclusion: XGB-RF demonstrated robustness and transferability across datasets, making it a promising approach for diabetes risk stratification. Future validation in broader, multi-site settings is recommended.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies the mathematical origins of scaling laws in deep learning, attributing them to data redundancy, and provides a rigorous explanation using kernel regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the elusive mathematical basis of scaling laws, particularly the scaling exponent, in deep learning.

Method: Utilized kernel regression to link scaling laws to data covariance spectra and derived mathematical relationships explaining scaling behavior.

Result: Showed that the learning curve's slope depends on data redundancy and established that these laws hold universally across various transformations, architectures, and regimes.

Conclusion: Scaling laws in deep learning are redundancy laws, revealing a unified theoretical basis for observed power-law behavior in model performance.

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) method to address physical law violations in diffusion models, achieving superior physical adherence and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of diffusion models producing output violating physical laws in scientific domains.

Method: Introduces PIRF, which optimizes physics-informed generation via trajectory-level rewards and mitigates inefficiencies through layer-wise truncated backpropagation and weight-based regularization.

Result: PIRF demonstrated superior physical enforcement and sampling efficiency across five PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reward fine-tuning via PIRF offers a promising advancement in scientific generative modeling by ensuring adherence to physical constraints efficiently.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses estimating the inverse temperature parameter (β) of an n-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample, with a nearly O(n) time estimator that is consistent under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating parameters of statistical models, like the truncated Ising model, is computationally challenging and crucial for applications in statistical mechanics, machine learning, and data analysis.

Method: The authors design an estimator by maximizing pseudolikelihood and generalizing prior techniques to the case of truncated Ising models, incorporating graph constraints and SAT formula truncation.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves consistency with an accuracy of O(Δ³/√n) under specific conditions relating to graph degree and formula truncation complexity.

Conclusion: The work extends previous research by effectively handling the harder scenario of truncated Ising models, providing a computationally efficient and consistent estimator.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

### [227] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a framework to enhance the efficiency of constraint-based causal discovery via a divide-and-aggregate strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational inefficiency of constraint-based causal discovery, which suffers from the high computational cost of conditional independence tests (CITs), especially with large sample sizes.

Method: The E-CIT divides the data into subsets, applies a base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates p-values using a novel method based on stable distributions, reducing the computational complexity to linear in fixed subset sizes.

Result: E-CIT significantly reduces the computational load of CITs and causal discovery while maintaining competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex real-world testing scenarios.

Conclusion: E-CIT is a practical, consistent, and scalable solution that overcomes the computational bottlenecks of constraint-based causal discovery without compromising performance.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), widely used in physics and engineering, with modern machine learning methods remains largely unexplored.

Method: The authors propose the Neural FMM, which leverages the hierarchical computational structure of the FMM to separate local and far-field interactions, allowing efficient learning of their respective representations.

Result: The proposed Neural FMM significantly advances the state-of-the-art in learning Green's operators for elliptic PDEs.

Conclusion: Neural FMM demonstrates the successful integration of FMM with machine learning, highlighting its potential application for solving complex physics-based computational problems more effectively.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

### [229] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits softmax inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to simplify its framework into two supervised learning tasks, improving computational practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify IRL methods, which typically involve computationally-intensive steps, while retaining effectiveness, especially for modern function approximators.

Method: The authors reformulate IRL under the softmax model by defining a linear fixed-point condition dependent on the behavior policy. They reduce the problem to probabilistic classification and iterative regression.

Result: They provide a theoretical framework with a precise characterization of the solution, an oracle-based algorithm, error bounds, and demonstrate empirical results that often outperform traditional MaxEnt IRL.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a simpler and modular framework for IRL, making it feasible for modern machine learning methods while maintaining competitive or better performance compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

*Kamal Singh,Priyanka Rawat,Sami Marouani,Baptiste Jeudy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interpretable Machine Learning approach for QoE modeling in video streaming using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and compact frequency-domain features, achieving better prediction accuracy with transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in traditional black-box QoE modeling approaches and improve the accuracy of video streaming QoE prediction.

Method: The method utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable model, combined with frequency-domain features to analyze temporal information from raw time-series data.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved QoE prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods on popular datasets while providing model transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: The study shows that it is possible to achieve both accuracy and interpretability in QoE modeling by leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and frequency-domain features.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

### [231] [Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified analysis of the norm scaling behavior of minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolators in overparameterized linear regression, deriving closed-form results for conditions that govern norm saturation or growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the unsolved problem of analyzing the scaling of $\ell_r$ norms for minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolators in overparameterized settings and connect these insights to generalization behaviors.

Method: The authors use a dual-ray analysis approach to derive competitive outcomes between a signal spike and a bulk of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, leading to explicit predictions for data-dependent transitions and thresholds.

Result: They identify a critical data-dependent transition point ($n_\star$) and a universal threshold ($r_\star=2(p-1)$), analytically predicting which $\ell_r$ norms saturate and which grow as sample size increases. They also demonstrate that diagonal linear networks (DLNs) inherit similar scaling laws, connecting explicit and implicit bias properties.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the scaling laws of $\ell_r$ norms in overparameterized systems, offering insights into how generalization proxies depend on the choice of norms.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

### [232] [Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599)
*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces stable and memory-efficient solvers for neural SDEs to improve gradient accuracy and training reliability, addressing prior limitations of instability and high memory cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of existing SDE solvers, which suffer from either high memory usage or instability and gradient errors.

Method: Developed Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) Runge-Kutta schemes combining stability, near-reversibility, and memory efficiency for solving neural SDEs.

Result: Numerical experiments showed that EES schemes are more stable and reliable compared to earlier methods, supporting scalable and accurate training.

Conclusion: The proposed EES schemes provide a practical basis for efficient and reliable training of neural SDE models by overcoming prior trade-offs.

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

### [233] [No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21296)
*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the weaknesses and limitations of data reconstruction attacks on neural networks, demonstrating that memorization-based attacks are unreliable without prior knowledge and proposing insights to enhance privacy while maintaining generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and security concerns arising from neural networks memorizing training data and assess the reliability of reconstruction attacks.

Method: The authors analyzed the limitations of existing data reconstruction methods both theoretically and empirically, identifying conditions where such attacks fail and proving the unreliability of these attacks without prior data knowledge.

Result: They found that exact reconstruction of training examples relies on chance, and that extensively trained networks are less vulnerable to reconstruction attacks due to stronger implicit bias conditions.

Conclusion: The study refines the theoretical understanding of training set leakage and highlights conditions under which privacy can be reconciled with strong generalization, offering strategies to mitigate reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Su Ann Low,Quentin Rommel,Kevin S. Miller,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores function encoders, showing their connection to kernel methods and feature learning, and proposes training algorithms for efficient and compact basis learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of creating adaptive, compact, and scalable representations of Hilbert spaces of functions, with potential for better efficiency and principled understanding.

Method: The authors propose two training methods: a progressive approach for growing basis functions incrementally and a train-then-prune approach for post-training efficiency. They utilize PCA principles and derive generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques.

Result: The proposed methods successfully maintain accuracy with fewer basis functions on benchmarks, such as polynomial datasets and nonlinear dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Function encoders offer a principled framework connecting neural networks to kernel methods, enabling efficient and scalable learning of adaptable and compact functional spaces.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

*Longxuan Yu,Xing Shi,Xianghao Kong,Tong Jia,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach to estimate mutual information (MI) using denoising diffusion models, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating MI is crucial for understanding relationships between random variables in complex systems, but existing methods face significant challenges in doing so.

Method: The authors integrate the information-theoretic framework with denoising diffusion models, leveraging Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) gaps over signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and adaptive importance sampling for scalable MI estimation.

Result: The proposed method passes self-consistency tests and outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators, even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: Denoising diffusion models provide a scalable and superior approach to MI estimation, with potential applications to various complex systems.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

*Daehee Lee,Dongsu Lee,TaeYoon Kwack,Wonje Choi,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SIL-C, a framework to maintain compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies for efficient learning in embodied agents, without needing policy re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge where evolving skill sets disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, thus limiting their reusability and generalization.

Method: SIL-C uses lazy learning-based mapping to dynamically align policy subtask spaces with agent skill spaces based on trajectory distribution similarity.

Result: SIL-C effectively evaluates across various scenarios, maintaining compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency.

Conclusion: SIL-C provides a solution for improving incrementally learned skills while enhancing downstream task performance without structural adaptations or policy retraining.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Latent Twins," a unifying framework that links representation learning with classical scientific modeling through latent space surrogates for equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integration between representation learning and algorithmic solution methods, particularly in scientific machine learning applications, such as model reduction and dynamical systems.

Method: Proposes the Latent Twins framework, which creates a hidden surrogate in a learned latent space governed by mathematical operators, unifying multiple modeling techniques as one overarching principle.

Result: Validated the framework with fundamental approximation properties for ODEs and PDEs through experiments on canonical ODEs, PDE benchmarks, and a real-world dataset in geopotential reanalysis.

Conclusion: Latent Twins provide compact, interpretable surrogates compatible with existing scientific processes, offering scalable and bridging approaches between data-driven methods and traditional modeling.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents GRPO, a method transforming multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning for efficient training of LLM agents, achieving high success rates and strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training LLM agents for multi-turn task planning, such as sparse rewards, credit assignment, and computational costs.

Method: The approach involves reducing multi-turn tasks to single-turn reasoning tasks and optimizing policies through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using dense rewards.

Result: The proposed 1.5B parameter model outperforms larger models (up to 14B) with a 70% success rate in tasks requiring over 30 steps, showcasing efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Transforming multi-turn tasks into single-turn reasoning facilitates efficient and generalizable model training while outperforming larger models on complex task planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

*Yipu Zhang,Chengshuo Zhang,Ziyu Zhou,Gang Qu,Hao Zheng,Yuping Wang,Hui Shen,Hongwen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a framework aimed at addressing privacy and non-IID data challenges in multi-site fMRI studies through collaborative modeling without sharing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy concerns and non-IID heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies challenge the development of generalized models.

Method: The proposed method, PFedDL, uses independent dictionary learning at each site, separating the learned dictionaries into a shared global component and a site-specific local component, with global atoms updated by federated aggregation.

Result: Experimental analysis on the ABIDE dataset shows that PFedDL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and accuracy for non-IID datasets.

Conclusion: By integrating shared and personalized modeling across sites, PFedDL effectively enhances collaborative analysis under privacy constraints, demonstrating its potential in handling large-scale neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

*Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies whether Audio Large Language Models (LLMs) truly utilize audio in reasoning by using the MM-SHAP framework, and reveals mixed reliance on audio versus text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if Audio LLMs genuinely listen to audio content or rely solely on textual reasoning in conversational tasks.

Method: The research adapts the MM-SHAP framework based on Shapley values to quantify the contribution of audio and textual modalities in model predictions.

Result: The study finds that higher-accuracy models rely more on text but still utilize audio for certain tasks like localizing sound events.

Conclusion: The first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs shows that while textual inputs heavily influence predictions, audio is not entirely ignored. This work aims to guide future research in explainable AI for audio.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

*Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CERMIC, which enhances multi-agent reinforcement learning exploration by dynamically calibrating curiosity based on inferred multi-agent context, leading to better performance in sparse-reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intrinsic motivation methods, like artificial curiosity, fail in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning settings due to their inability to distinguish between stochasticity and meaningful novelty. The lack of accounting for peer behavior novelty limits effective exploration.

Method: The authors propose CERMIC, a framework that filters noisy surprise signals and calibrates intrinsic curiosity dynamically by considering multi-agent contexts. It generates intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration with high information gain.

Result: CERMIC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward multi-agent environments, as demonstrated on benchmark suites like VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2.

Conclusion: CERMIC provides a theoretically grounded, context-aware exploration mechanism that robustly improves multi-agent exploration and learning in environments with sparse rewards.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

*Tongxi Wang,Zhuoyang Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores In-Context Learning (ICL) and the effect of prompt length, presenting a theoretical analysis and a practical estimation method to improve prompt reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and improve the sensitivity and reliability of In-Context Learning (ICL) to prompt length, which is critical for its practical effectiveness.

Method: Developed a lower bound linking prompt demonstrations to ICL stability, introduced a two-stage observable estimator using a one-shot calibration for real-world prompt-length estimations.

Result: The proposed approach provides theoretical bounds that align well with empirical results across datasets, while calibrated refinements further tighten the theoretical and practical gap.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the interpretability and reliability of ICL in finite-sample realistic scenarios, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for more stable prompting.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

*Wenkai Guo,Xuefeng Liu,Haolin Wang,Jianwei Niu,Shaojie Tang,Jing Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the risks of privacy leakage when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in a federated learning (FL) setup and evaluates mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs collaboratively across organizations using federated learning (FL) allows privacy while leveraging shared data, addressing concerns over data sharing reluctance and the need for privacy-preserving approaches.

Method: The authors perform extensive experiments to assess data leakage risks during federated fine-tuning of LLMs. They propose an enhanced attack strategy that exploits global model updates to amplify privacy leakage. Additionally, they evaluate privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and regularization constraints.

Result: The study finds significant privacy leakage risks even with FL, exacerbated as model size grows. The proposed attack demonstrates that sensitive training data can still be extracted from the global model, and enhanced tracking further increases vulnerability.

Conclusion: While FL offers a promising framework for collaborative LLM fine-tuning, it is vulnerable to data leakage. Mitigation requires robust privacy strategies such as differential privacy and safe alignment of LLMs. The findings offer practical guidance for reducing these risks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

*Mohammadsaleh Refahi,Bahrad A. Sokhansanj,James R. Brown,Gail Rosen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRM-DTI, a framework for predicting drug-target binding affinity with state-of-the-art performance using a lightweight model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug discovery requires efficient prediction of drug-target binding affinity to identify promising compounds early, but existing models poorly generalize due to lack of geometric regularization.

Method: FIRM-DTI uses FiLM layers for conditioning molecular embeddings on proteins, applies triplet loss for metric learning, and employs an RBF regression head for smooth predictions.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTI-DG benchmark, validated by ablation and out-of-domain studies.

Conclusion: Conditioning and metric learning significantly enhance the prediction of drug-target affinity within a lightweight framework.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

### [245] [CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712)
*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CE-GPPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) by preserving gradient signals traditionally discarded in PPO, resulting in improved entropy control and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current reinforcement learning techniques like PPO that discard useful gradient signals, leading to issues in policy entropy control during LLM training.

Method: The authors propose CE-GPPO, which reintroduces clipped token gradients in PPO in a controlled manner, balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning training of LLMs.

Result: CE-GPPO mitigates entropy instability and achieves superior performance compared to established baselines in mathematical reasoning benchmarks across various model scales.

Conclusion: CE-GPPO enhances the capability of reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize LLMs by systematically improving entropy dynamics and achieving better reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

### [246] [A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20719)
*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynGA, a genetic algorithm tailored to synthesizable molecular design, featuring custom operators and integration with machine learning for state-of-the-art performance in design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance molecular design by leveraging the effectiveness of genetic algorithms while ensuring synthesizability, a critical factor in designing practical molecules.

Method: The method involves a genetic algorithm (SynGA) with custom crossover and mutation operators constrained to synthesizable molecular space, paired with a fitness function modification. A machine learning-based filter is also integrated to improve performance, leading to a model-based variant (SynGBO) for property optimization.

Result: SynGA demonstrates effectiveness in tasks like synthesizable analog search and property optimization and achieves state-of-the-art performance when coupled with machine learning-based block filtering.

Conclusion: SynGA shows promise as a robust standalone baseline for molecular design and as a modular component in larger synthesis-aware workflows, combining efficiency and synthesizability-focused capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

### [247] [The Impact of Audio Watermarking on Audio Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20736)
*Zhenshan Zhang,Xueping Zhang,Yechen Wang,Liwei Jin,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how audio watermarking impacts speech-based anti-spoofing systems and proposes the KPWL framework to mitigate performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the influence of widely used audio watermarking on anti-spoofing systems, as its effects remain unexamined.

Method: The authors generate a Watermark-Spoofing dataset by applying various watermarking techniques to existing anti-spoofing datasets and evaluate performance under these conditions.

Result: Watermarking consistently degrades performance, with higher densities causing more errors. The KPWL framework mitigates these effects while preserving original spoofing detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Audio watermarking introduces a significant domain shift, necessitating watermark-resilient systems, establishing benchmarks, and protocols to address this overlooked challenge.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [248] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the trade-offs in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tools, focusing on runtime, ML utility, and data similarity, using sensitivity analysis of hyperparameter choices. GReaT is faster, but REaLTabFormer performs better on larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models are promising for TDS, outperforming GANs and Diffusion models, but their high computational costs can be restrictive for many users.

Method: The study conducts sensitivity assessments of Transformer-based TDS tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, analyzing their performance across 10 model setups on four real-world datasets while considering runtime, data quality, and similarity.

Result: GReaT achieves faster runtimes, while REaLTabFormer excels in data quality and utility for larger datasets, but has longer runtimes. Lightweight configurations of REaLTabFormer provide the best balance between performance metrics.

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer is more effective for large datasets due to its robust utility and data similarity, but runtime efficiency remains a challenge. GReaT is better suited for quicker tasks on smaller datasets, suggesting room to improve computational efficiency in TDS tools.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

### [249] [IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20783)
*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models in capturing local variations in non-stationary time-series data by combining them with CNNs and proposing IConv, a new convolutional architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLP-based models perform well in capturing long-term dependency but fail to address local variations, patterns, and residual components in non-stationary time-series data. This provides a motivation to integrate CNNs to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid model combining MLPs for long-term dependency modeling and CNNs for fine-grained local pattern modeling using diverse kernels. They introduce IConv, a new convolutional architecture that processes temporal dependencies independently for each channel and captures inter-channel relationships separately.

Result: Extensive experiments on time-series datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in multivariate time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: The combination of MLP and CNN architectures, along with the novel IConv approach, enhances time-series forecasting performance by effectively modeling both long-term trends and local variations.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiLAW, a method to dynamically adjust training sample weights for deep neural networks using only three learnable parameters, excelling in noisy and heterogeneous data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks in noisy and heterogeneous environments remains a critical challenge, necessitating adaptive techniques for robust learning.

Method: LiLAW adjusts loss weights dynamically based on sample difficulty. It employs three learnable parameters and a gradient step on the validation set for updates, minimizing hyperparameter tuning and validation data requirements.

Result: LiLAW improves performance across various datasets, noise levels, and architectures without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization.

Conclusion: LiLAW offers a practical, efficient, and robust method to enhance neural network training, particularly in challenging noisy data environments.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

### [251] [Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20789)
*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI), a method to improve sample efficiency and generalization of State Space Models (SSMs), particularly in low-data regimes, by aligning the model's inductive bias with the task's spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to improve data efficiency in machine learning models, recognizing that current large-scale models are limited by the finite nature of high-quality data and fixed inductive biases.

Method: The authors formalized the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs using an SSM-induced kernel and proposed the TDI method, which aligns the model's bias with task-specific spectral characteristics through power spectrum matching before training.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrated that TDI enhances generalization and sample efficiency, particularly when data is scarce.

Conclusion: The study provides both theoretical and practical advancements for designing data-efficient models, offering a significant step towards reducing data requirements in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fairness-enhanced framework for Data-Free Robustness Distillation, focusing on addressing category-level robustness disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFRD methods fail to address robust fairness issues, leading to unequal robustness across different categories.

Method: The FERD framework adjusts adversarial example proportions using robustness-guided class reweighting and generates fairness-aware and uniform-target examples for balanced robustness.

Result: FERD improves worst-class robustness significantly under adversarial attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both robustness and fairness.

Conclusion: FERD successfully mitigates category-level robustness disparities and enhances overall fairness in robustness distillation.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2I-Diff, a framework utilizing time-frequency representation and diffusion modeling to generate high-quality fMRI data for brain network analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of resource-intensive fMRI data acquisition and the inability of existing generative models to capture complex BOLD dynamics.

Method: The framework transforms BOLD signals into spectrograms via time-dependent Fourier transforms, applies a classifier-free diffusion model for generation, and reverts spectrograms back to BOLD signals.

Result: The generated fMRI data exhibits improved accuracy and generalization in downstream brain network classification tasks.

Conclusion: T2I-Diff effectively synthesizes high-quality fMRI data, overcoming traditional challenges through advanced modeling techniques.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaTS-Bench, a large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning, which integrates numeric series, metadata, chart images, and captions derived from LLMs and human refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks for time series captioning, which usually involve synthetic data, simplistic captions, or lack metadata and visual representations.

Method: A scalable pipeline was developed to create captions verified through LLM oracle outputs, factual checks, and human refinement. The dataset includes 11 diverse restructured datasets, comprising 465k training timestamps, test captions, and Q&A tasks.

Result: The paper provides a robust dataset, CaTS-Bench, along with tailored evaluation metrics and benchmarks for leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing their capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench serves as a foundational tool for advancing research in time series analysis and foundation models, combining real-world complexity and rigorous verification techniques.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

*Keitaro Sakamoto,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified explanation for late-phase phenomena in deep learning, such as grokking and information bottleneck, through the lens of neural collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind phenomena like grokking and information bottleneck in neural networks remain poorly understood, despite their significance in machine learning.

Method: The paper analyzes the relationship between neural collapse and late-phase phenomena by investigating the contraction of within-class variance and its dynamics over time, supported by theoretical and empirical validations.

Result: The late-phase phenomena can be explained by time-scale differences between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse.

Conclusion: Neural collapse provides a unified framework to understand and connect late-phase behaviors in neural networks, validated across multiple datasets and architectures.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

*Jiaqi Tang,Yinsong Xu,Yang Liu,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework that shapes initial states of multi-modal fusion models through unimodal training to mitigate modality competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study identifies issues of modality competition during joint training in multi-modal fusion tasks, where one modality dominates others, causing inefficiency.

Method: The proposed approach involves defining Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify modality impact, using mutual information-based metrics, developing a FastPID solver for partial information decomposition, and employing an asynchronous training controller.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal fusion, mitigating competition and improving results.

Conclusion: The research underscores that shaping the initial states of pre-fusion models through unimodal training effectively alleviates modality competition, unlocking potential synergy in multi-modal fusion processes.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Conclusion: MOIRA demonstrated robustness to missing omics modalities, enhanced disease biomarker detection, and provided a biologically valid framework for multi-omics integration.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

### [258] [Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846)
*Yutong Xia,Chang Xu,Yuxuan Liang,Qingsong Wen,Roger Zimmermann,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal time series generation (TSG), a new task family that uses a diffusion-based framework called CaTSG to extend TSG into interventional and counterfactual scenarios and achieve superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing limitations of existing conditional TSG models, which fail to account for unobserved confounding and are limited to observational correlations.

Method: The authors formalize causal TSG within Pearl's causal ladder and propose CaTSG, a diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance and causal score functions derived via abduction-action-prediction.

Result: CaTSG achieves superior fidelity for observational data while uniquely enabling interventional and counterfactual generation tasks, which existing models cannot handle.

Conclusion: This work introduces causal TSG as a new task family and demonstrates CaTSG as an effective initial approach, paving the way for more reliable simulation and generation under interventions and counterfactuals.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

*Kjersti Engan,Neel Kanwal,Anita Yeconia,Ladislaus Blacy,Yuda Munyaw,Estomih Mduma,Hege Ersdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a masked transformer-based autoencoder to reconstruct missing fetal heart rate (FHR) data, improving the ability to analyze these signals for predicting the need for neonatal breathing assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial for assessing fetal well-being; however, wearable monitor data often includes gaps due to movements. Handling these missing data effectively is vital for developing AI-based tools for risk prediction.

Method: The researchers propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing spatial and frequency components, aiming to improve signal inpainting and forecasting capabilities.

Result: The approach showed robustness to varying durations of missing FHR data and can retrospectively enhance research datasets' utility for AI-based risk algorithm development.

Conclusion: The proposed method holds promise not only for improving analysis of historical data but also for integrating it into wearable devices to facilitate real-time, robust risk detection.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Federated Markov Imputation (FMI) to address missing data in federated learning with varying temporal granularities in ICU data, and demonstrates its effectiveness using the MIMIC-IV dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of missing data in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly due to irregular sampling intervals across Intensive Care Units (ICUs).

Method: The authors propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), which is a privacy-preserving approach for collaboratively building global transition models to handle temporal imputation in federated learning settings.

Result: FMI outperforms traditional local imputation baselines in handling irregular sampling intervals, as demonstrated through a real-world task on sepsis onset prediction with the MIMIC-IV dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed FMI method significantly improves imputation performance in federated learning settings with irregular temporal data, preserving privacy and enhancing collaboration across ICUs.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic
health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at
varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units
(ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal
imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces StyleBench to evaluate reasoning strategies across different Large Language Models (LLMs) and tasks, discovering that strategy efficacy depends on model scale and task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task types in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: Development of StyleBench, a benchmark that assesses five reasoning strategies (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models spanning various scales and families.

Result: The analysis shows no single reasoning style is universally superior; efficacy varies by model scale and task. Large models excel with search-based reasoning, while smaller models lack robustness and tend to guess.

Conclusion: The findings guide optimal reasoning strategy selection based on constraints like model scale and task type, with implications for improving LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

### [262] [Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20869)
*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses random sensor delays in reinforcement learning (RL) for partially observable environments and proposes a model-based filtering method to handle these delays, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world scenarios involve random observation delays, yet standard RL algorithms assume instantaneous environment perception. This gap impairs their performance in realistic settings.

Method: The authors develop a model-based filtering process that updates the belief state with incoming delayed observations, and incorporate it into a delay-aware RL framework applied to the Dreamer algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms delay-aware MDP baselines in handling random delays, remains robust to delay distribution shifts, and proves effective in simulated robotics tasks compared to common heuristics.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling observation delays is critical for RL performance under random delay settings, and the proposed framework offers a robust solution for such scenarios.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [263] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses data imbalance issues in federated learning by proposing a client selection approach that aligns label distributions, resulting in improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the degradation in federated learning performance caused by data imbalance among clients.

Method: The paper introduces a client selection strategy that selects active clients to align label distributions with either a balanced target or the federation's combined label distribution.

Result: Empirical studies show that aligning with a balanced distribution handles local imbalance effectively, while using the combined label distribution is better for global imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed client selection approach successfully mitigates the negative effects of data imbalance, enhancing performance in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

### [264] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a federated learning model enhanced with attention mechanisms for predicting sepsis onset, emphasizing early detection and variable prediction windows across ICU data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early and accurate sepsis prediction in ICUs without compromising patient privacy and overcoming limitations of hospital-specific data.

Method: A federated attention-enhanced LSTM model trained on multi-centric ICU data with support for variable prediction horizons.

Result: The proposed FL model achieves performance close to centralized models and excels in early sepsis prediction while reducing computational and communication overhead.

Conclusion: Federated learning with variable prediction windows is effective for sepsis prediction, enhancing early detection and operational efficiency without significant performance compromises.

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

*Hideyuki Suzuki,Hiroshi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models that replaces stochastic processes, enhancing efficiency and sample quality in generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and sample quality of generative models using discrete diffusion by eliminating reliance on stochastic denoising processes.

Method: A deterministic denoising algorithm using a modified herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics for discrete state transitions, bypassing the need for retraining or continuous embeddings.

Result: The approach consistently improves efficiency and sample quality in text and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: Deterministic reverse processes, effective in continuous diffusion, can also improve generative modeling in discrete state spaces.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a ConvLSTM-based framework for predicting crime by integrating mobility, sociodemographic, and historical crime data, demonstrating improved accuracy across multiple cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve crime forecasting by exploring how micro-level mobility data, along with traditional crime and sociodemographic information, enhances prediction accuracy at fine-grained spatial and temporal levels.

Method: The paper proposes a methodology using ConvLSTM networks trained on crime incidents, sociodemographic data, and human mobility data across four U.S. cities. Predictions are made 12 hours ahead with input sequences spanning 2 to 14 days, compared against logistic regression, random forest, and LSTM baselines.

Result: Incorporating mobility data, especially with sociodemographic features, boosted model performance. ConvLSTM outperformed baselines in recall, precision, and F1 score across all cities. Input sequence length influenced performance based on crime type.

Conclusion: The study concludes that diverse data integration enhances crime prediction and demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of deep learning at fine-grained resolutions.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency and reduce heat energy loss in heavy equipment actuators, decreasing environmental impact and operational costs.

Method: The authors compare PDCV and PFCV hydraulic circuits through energy analyses and utilize PID control (fuzzy-tuned) for actuator positioning. Simulations are performed in MATLAB/Simulink and validated experimentally.

Result: The PFCV-based hydraulic circuit shows 8.5% higher energy efficiency compared to the PDCV-based system.

Conclusion: The proposed PFCV solution enhances energy efficiency in heavy machinery actuators, reducing energy waste and improving sustainability.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenFacts, a framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series, which are more plausible and interpretable than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model transparency and address the shortcomings in existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations in multivariate time series, which often result in invalid outputs.

Method: The authors propose a generative framework called GenFacts, leveraging a class-discriminative variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization.

Result: GenFacts demonstrates higher plausibility (+18.7%) compared to state-of-the-art methods and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study, tested on radar gesture data and handwritten letter trajectories.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that in time series data, plausibility and interpretability are more critical than sparsity alone for generating actionable counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines why transformer-based models often underperform in time series forecasting and finds that their attention mechanisms often degenerate into simple MLPs due to embedding failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in NLP and vision tasks but struggle in time series forecasting. Understanding their shortcomings demands investigation to improve performance.

Method: Progressively modified transformers into MLPs for experiments and designed interpretable datasets to analyze the attention mechanism's inefficacy, supported by theoretical analysis on embedding failures.

Result: The attention mechanism in time series transformers fails as intended, often degenerating into MLP behavior due to improper embedding methods.

Conclusion: Current embedding techniques create poorly structured latent spaces, causing the attention mechanism and transformers to fail on time series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are accelerated alternatives to Gaussian Process inference, utilizing Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) for efficient high-dimensional regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational efforts in Gaussian Process inference, especially within high-dimensional regression tasks, by leveraging PFNs as a fast surrogate approach.

Method: The paper introduces Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA), focusing on input-only similarity and label propagation via values, designed to mirror the Gaussian process update without relying on kernels.

Result: Localized attention in PFNs significantly improves validation loss by more than 50% in multi-dimensional tasks. PFNs achieve rapid and accurate approximations with errors of approximately 1E-3, performing over 80x faster than exact GP inference methods.

Conclusion: PFNs equipped with DVA offer an efficient and scalable alternative to GP inference, capable of handling high-dimensional problems while delivering accuracy and computational speed.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow matching, an alternative to diffusion models, faces instability in the low-noise regime, degrading learning and representation. The paper introduces Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid approach, to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of flow matching, a continuous-time generative modeling method, especially in the challenging low-noise regime, where the existing method faces instability and degraded representation.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of low-noise instability in flow matching. They propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol combining standard flow matching for moderate and high noise levels and contrastive feature alignment for low noise.

Result: LCF enhances convergence speed and representation stability, addressing low-noise instabilities in flow matching.

Conclusion: Flow matching's low-noise pathologies significantly impact its effectiveness. LCF successfully mitigates this problem, unlocking its full potential for generative modeling and representation tasks.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixGate enhances multiview learning for Boolean circuits by aligning function-aware representations before applying masked modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview learning offers complementary information from different graph-based representations, but structural heterogeneity across views limits effectiveness, particularly for self-supervised methods.

Method: The MixGate framework employs a training curriculum with Equivalence Alignment Loss to create a shared representation space, followed by multiview masked modeling.

Result: Experiments and ablation studies show that the alignment-first approach transforms masked modeling into a more effective technique for boosting performance.

Conclusion: Functional alignment is crucial for leveraging multiview self-supervision and improving masked modeling outcomes.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

### [273] [Knowledgeable Language Models as Black-Box Optimizers for Personalized Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20975)
*Michael S. Yao,Osbert Bastani,Alma Andersson,Tommaso Biancalani,Aïcha Bentaieb,Claudia Iriondo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEON, a method leveraging large language models (LLMs) combined with domain-specific prior knowledge for optimizing personalized treatment plans, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of surrogate models in personalized medicine that often fail to generalize to unseen patient-treatment combinations. They leverage prior domain knowledge to address these gaps.

Method: LEON employs large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers, using an 'optimization by prompting' approach. This method incorporates knowledge from domain-specific resources like medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs without fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed LEON method outperformed both traditional optimization techniques and existing LLM-based methods in creating personalized treatment regimens.

Conclusion: Integrating large language models with prior domain knowledge via LEON is a viable, superior strategy for advancing personalized medicine by overcoming generalization issues inherent in surrogate models.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

### [274] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLUE, a framework for effectively unlearning undesirable knowledge in LLMs by separating forget and retain circuits for superior neural localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of selectively unlearning undesirable knowledge in LLMs without over-forgetting or under-erasing target information.

Method: CLUE leverages circuit discovery and transforms identified circuits into conjunctive normal forms (CNF) to distinguish neurons for forgetting and retaining, followed by targeted fine-tuning.

Result: CLUE achieves better efficacy in forgetting target information and retaining essential skills compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: CLUE offers a precise and effective solution for unlearning undesirable data while preserving unrelated capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

*Xiangyu Dong,Xingyi Zhang,Sibo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracAug is a plug-in framework for graph-level anomaly detection that improves results by augmenting graphs and pseudo-labeling data to address issues like high labeling costs and data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High labeling costs and dataset imbalance limit the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph-level anomaly detection tasks.

Method: FracAug generates semantically consistent graph variants using a weighted distance-aware margin loss for multi-scale topology, and pseudo-labels data through mutual verification between original and augmented graphs.

Result: FracAug achieves consistent improvements across 14 GNNs on 12 datasets, enhancing AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

Conclusion: FracAug is a versatile and effective augmentation framework compatible with various GNNs, significantly advancing graph-level anomaly detection.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

*Liwen Sun,Hao-Ren Yao,Gary Gao,Ophir Frieder,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CATCH-FM is a methodology using EHR-based foundation models for early cancer detection, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes in risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cancer screening techniques are expensive, intrusive, and not globally accessible, which leads to preventable deaths from missed early detections.

Method: The authors pretrained EHR foundation models with medical code sequences on millions of records, scaling up to 2.4 billion parameters, and fine-tuned these models on cancer-risk-focused datasets.

Result: CATCH-FM achieves a 60% sensitivity, 99% specificity, and high negative predictive value in testing with 30,000 patients. It outperformed both feature-based and language models, including general and medical ones, as well as leading in pancreatic cancer prediction on a few-shot leaderboard.

Conclusion: CATCH-FM demonstrates strong efficacy, robustness across diverse datasets, and the capacity for capturing complex cancer risk factors, providing a significant advancement in accessible early cancer detection methods.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCR framework and LARU algorithm for GPU caching, enhancing cache efficiency with machine learning predictions, significantly improving performance while maintaining robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cache inefficiency in GPU inference, particularly affecting hit rates and time-to-first-token, and limitations of existing caching policies.

Method: Develop the LCR framework featuring LARU, which combines LRU with machine-learned predictions and adapts based on error estimation.

Result: LCR improves throughput up to 24.2% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3%, under both accurate and poor predictions.

Conclusion: The LCR framework effectively balances theoretical advances and practical application, enhancing GPU inference performance reliably and efficiently.

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

### [278] [Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Binary Autoencoder (BAE) to promote feature independence and sparsity in Large Language Models (LLMs) through entropy minimization and discretized hidden activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for feature interpretation in LLMs rely on techniques that enforce sparsity through training-time regularization, but they lack an explicit guarantee of global sparsity across instances, leading to suboptimal feature atomization.

Method: The authors developed a Binary Autoencoder (BAE) that optimizes feature sparsity across instances by minimizing entropy on minibatches of hidden activations. They discretize activations to 1-bit using a step function and enable backpropagation using gradient estimation.

Result: The BAE method allows for reliable entropy estimation and effective feature untangling from LLM hidden states. It produces the largest number of interpretable features among baseline methods while avoiding dense features.

Conclusion: The Binary Autoencoder (BAE) is effective for promoting interpretability and sparsity in LLMs, serving as a robust tool for feature extraction and entropy measurement in hidden states.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Qingyu Han,Qian Li,Linxin Yang,Qian Chen,Qingjiang Shi,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using Learning to Optimize (L2O) by proposing a Local-UID scheme for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which improves expressiveness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ILPs are challenging optimization problems essential in real-world applications, and existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods often fail to generalize due to issues related to unique identifiers.

Method: The authors propose a Local-UID scheme leveraging d-hop uniqueness coloring for node identifiers, building the ColorGNN and ColorUID models, which integrate color-based features to enhance network expressiveness and generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in ILP benchmarks, better out-of-distribution generalization in linear programming datasets, and effective performance in general graph tasks with advanced methods.

Conclusion: The Local-UID scheme and Color-enhanced models significantly address the tradeoffs in solving ILPs with GNNs, achieving strong expressiveness and generalization without the downsides of global unique identifiers.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

### [280] [Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002)
*Meng Wan,Benxi Tian,Jue Wang,Cui Hui,Ningming Nie,Tiantian Liu,Zongguo Wang,Cao Rongqiang,Peng Shi,Yangang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces lossless compression as a novel paradigm for evaluating time series models, linking optimal compression length with negative log-likelihood under Shannon's theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for time series models focus on specific tasks (e.g., forecasting, imputation) but fail to assess if models capture the full generative distribution of data.

Method: The authors utilize Shannon's source coding theorem to connect optimal compression length with negative log-likelihood, and define an evaluation protocol, metrics, and an open-source framework (TSCom-Bench).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that compression exposes distributional weaknesses in state-of-the-art time series models (e.g., TimeXer, iTransformer) that are overlooked by standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lossless compression provides a rigorous, complementary approach to evaluating time series models, enhancing understanding of a model’s capacity to represent data distributions.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

*Seokbin Yoon,Keumjin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAIFormer, a novel neural architecture for predicting multi-aircraft flight trajectories, addressing challenges like individual behavior modeling, interaction handling, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve predictions of multi-agent flight trajectories by addressing challenges in modeling individual aircraft behaviors, interactions, and explainable outcomes.

Method: Introduced MAIFormer with two attention modules: masked multivariate attention for spatio-temporal patterns and agent attention for inter-aircraft interactions.

Result: MAIFormer outperformed other methods on a real-world dataset from Incheon International Airport in multiple metrics, providing interpretable outcomes.

Conclusion: MAIFormer enhances accuracy and transparency in multi-aircraft trajectory prediction, offering better practical utility in air traffic control.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExMoIRL is a novel generative framework combining phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation, outperforming existing methods in drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in AI-based drug design, particularly the limitations of traditional phenotype-based and target-based strategies, which either incur high experimental costs or ignore cellular system-level responses.

Method: ExMoIRL employs phenotype-guided pretraining on transcriptional profiles, fine-tuned by multi-objective reinforcement learning. The reward function integrates docking affinity, drug-likeness scores, ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization.

Result: ExMoIRL outperforms previous models, generating molecules with strong drug-like properties, high target affinity, and effective inhibitory potency against cancer cells.

Conclusion: This generative framework demonstrates a synergistic approach that combines phenotypic and target-aware strategies, offering a promising path for de novo drug discovery.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the mechanism behind In-context Learning (ICL) by analyzing how information removal enables task-specific focus in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanism of In-context Learning (ICL) and how language models process information for few-shot learning.

Method: The authors studied zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, applied a low-rank filter for selective information removal, analyzed task-oriented information in model representations, and identified key attention heads (Denoising Heads) responsible for this process.

Result: They found that task-specific filtering of information improves ICL performance, with key attention heads playing a crucial role, as shown through ablation experiments.

Conclusion: Information removal and Denoising Heads are essential mechanisms in ICL, steering language models to focus on the intended task and improving few-shot learning accuracies.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge utilizes small proxy models to improve dataset optimization for large language models, focusing on reasoning tasks and reducing costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of pre-training large language models makes it crucial to optimize datasets using smaller and more efficient models. These reasoning tasks are particularly expensive because they tend to emerge only at larger model scales.

Method: rBridge aligns small proxy models with the pre-training objective and target tasks by using reasoning traces as gold labels and weighing negative log-likelihood with task alignment.

Result: The approach cuts dataset ranking costs by over 100x, demonstrates strong correlation across reasoning benchmarks from 1B to 32B models, and transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets between 1B and 7B models.

Conclusion: rBridge provides a cost-efficient solution for reasoning-focused pre-training, leveraging small models while maintaining high predictive accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code introduces a controlled benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn and generalize new reasoning algorithms via reinforcement learning, revealing notable successes and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs can develop genuinely novel reasoning strategies and evaluate their ability to transfer learned skills to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces DELTA-Code, a benchmark of synthetic coding problems designed to isolate reasoning skills and assess both learnability and transferability. Techniques like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop are tested to enhance model training.

Result: Experiments showed that LLMs can achieve near-perfect accuracy on previously unsolvable problems after a phase of stagnation, but struggle with generalization in transformative cases. Transferability results show gains within families and recomposed skills.

Conclusion: DELTA-Code serves as a valuable tool to study RL-driven reasoning in LLMs, enabling the exploration of their potential to surpass pre-existing patterns and acquire new algorithmic skills, while also highlighting areas for improvement in transferability.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Actor-Critic without Actor" (ACA), which forgoes using a separate actor network in reinforcement learning, relying instead on gradient-based actions from a critic model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in traditional actor-critic reinforcement learning methods, such as reliance on separate actor and critic networks that complicate training, as well as additional burdens introduced by diffusion-based approaches.

Method: ACA eliminates the actor network and directly generates actions using the gradient of a noise-level critic, removing algorithmic overhead while maintaining policy improvement aligned with the critic.

Result: Through experiments on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks, ACA demonstrates favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to traditional actor-critic methods and diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: ACA offers a simpler and computationally efficient alternative to actor-critic methods, capable of capturing diverse behaviors and achieving effective results in online RL tasks.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

### [287] [FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21029)
*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in MLLMs by proposing a method (FORCE) to enhance the cross-model transferability of visual jailbreaking attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and transferability of visual jailbreaking attacks for assessing vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs.

Method: The authors analyze feature representation issues and propose FORCE, which broadens layer feature exploration and adjusts frequency feature influences based on semantics.

Result: FORCE discovered flattened feasible regions for visual attacks, increasing effectiveness across different models.

Conclusion: FORCE improves visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs, enhancing attack robustness and reliability.

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

### [288] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044)
*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the internal mechanisms of large language models after reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning and identifies distinct changes in activation patterns and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why RL fine-tuning improves the performance of large language models compared to supervised fine-tuning, especially in models with varying intrinsic characteristics.

Method: The authors use edge attribution patching (EAP) techniques to compare the internal activation intensity and diversity of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning across multiple model families.

Result: RL fine-tuning induces two effects: stronger activation intensity and greater diversity in activation patterns, enhancing generalization ability. Models fine-tuned with DPO show weaker internal changes compared to those fine-tuned with PPO or GRPO.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning systematically reshapes LLMs' internal pathways to make them more redundant and flexible, promoting better generalization. There are distinct methodological differences between online RL and preference-based fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

*Bing Liu,Wenqiang Yv,Xuzheng Yang,Shichang Wang,Junzhuo Liu,Peng Wang,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problem-solving, a vision-language task involving natural language queries on geometric diagrams, supported by the GeoRef dataset and fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing and interpreting geometric elements in diagrams from natural language prompts, which is critical for robust geometric problem-solving.

Method: They develop GeoRef, a benchmark dataset with high-quality annotations and synthetic data generation, and explore two tuning methods: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), alongside a verify-and-regenerate mechanism for accuracy improvements.

Result: GRPO outperforms SFT in aligning models to task-specific rewards, and their verify-and-regenerate mechanism further improves predictions' accuracy. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle on this task without dedicated training.

Conclusion: REC is essential for unlocking multimodal mathematical understanding and geometric reasoning, with GeoRef-trained models showing improvement on downstream tasks and highlighting the need for enhanced geometric grounding evaluation in AI.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

*Sedjro Salomon Hotegni,Sebastian Peitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPREAD leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to enhance multi-objective optimization by refining candidates efficiently using gradient-based updates and ensuring diversity with repulsion terms. It outperforms baselines in scalability, efficiency, and Pareto front coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to compute Pareto sets efficiently for large-scale and computationally expensive multi-objective optimization problems.

Method: SPREAD employs a conditional denoising diffusion process for decision space points, refining solutions using adaptive gradient descent strategies and Gaussian RBF-based diversity enhancements during reverse diffusion.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate SPREAD’s superiority over baseline methods, achieving enhanced performance in Pareto front coverage, computational efficiency, and scalability.

Conclusion: SPREAD effectively addresses multi-objective optimization challenges by combining diffusion modeling with innovative refinement techniques, proving its potential for scaling to complex and expensive problem scenarios.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

*Zhen Liu,Yongtao Zhang,Shaobo Ren,Yuxin You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATMC, a framework for improving graph domain adaptation by aligning distributions using both graph structure and attribute transformations. It addresses structural heterogeneity issues and achieves better node classification performance across networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation approaches face challenges in aligning distributions due to the structural heterogeneity between graph domains, leading to suboptimal performance in label-scarce scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes SATMC, which sequentially performs distribution alignment using graph structure and attribute transformations. It introduces mechanisms like domain information reduction and empirical Wasserstein distance.

Result: SATMC demonstrated superior performance in cross-network node classification tasks compared to other methods, validated through experiments on nine pairs of public datasets.

Conclusion: The SATMC framework improves graph domain adaptation by addressing structural heterogeneity, achieving tighter error bounds, and providing state-of-the-art results for node classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

### [292] [ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21070)
*Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Xin Gao,Yu Li,Zinan Tang,Conghui He,Rui Yan,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleDiff, a pipeline for efficiently generating difficult mathematical problems and improving reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex reasoning often benefits from exposure to difficult mathematical problems, but creating such problems at scale is costly and inefficient using current methods.

Method: The ScaleDiff pipeline identifies challenging problems from existing datasets with an adaptive thinking model and trains a specialized generator to create large-scale difficult problems efficiently without complex prompting or high API costs.

Result: The pipeline improves the accuracy of models on mathematical reasoning tasks significantly (e.g., an 11.3% improvement on ScaleDiff-Math dataset fine-tuning) and scales performance on benchmarks with a cost-effective approach.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff enables efficient, scalable generation of challenging mathematical problems, transferring reasoning capabilities effectively without relying on expensive teacher models. Its success demonstrates the scaling phenomenon in improving mathematical reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

### [293] [TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21081)
*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that optimizes Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) computations, achieving significant throughput improvements on NPUs and GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize MLA computations in attention mechanisms, addressing the limitations of existing naive and absorb formulations during decoding.

Method: The method combines naive and absorb kernel formulations to capitalize on their respective advantages for shared and non-shared prefix calculations.

Result: TyphoonMLA improves MLA throughput by up to 3x on NPUs and 3.24x on GPUs, with minimal memory overhead of 3%.

Conclusion: The hybrid TyphoonMLA approach effectively balances computational efficiency and bandwidth utilization, showcasing significant performance gains in MLA-based architectures.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

### [294] [GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097)
*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphUniverse, a framework for generating families of graphs to evaluate inductive generalization in graph models and explore robustness under controlled distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph learning benchmarks focus on transductive settings on single graphs, lacking tools to analyze how models generalize to unseen graphs and handle distribution shifts.

Method: The authors propose a framework, GraphUniverse, which generates semantically consistent but structurally diverse graphs. It allows fine-tuning of properties like homophily and degree distributions for systematic evaluation.

Result: By benchmarking multiple architectures (GNNs, graph transformers, etc.), they find that strong transductive performance does not predict inductive generalization. They also show that robustness to distribution shifts depends on architecture and graph regimes.

Conclusion: GraphUniverse offers a scalable and flexible tool for robust benchmarking, enabling the development of truly generalizable graph learning architectures and potentially advancing graph foundation models.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL enhances online reinforcement learning by utilizing vision-language models for action suggestions, improving sample efficiency and performance in sparse-reward tasks without changing optimality or adding significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online reinforcement learning is inefficient for complex tasks due to the need for extensive interactions, while VLA policies face challenges in low-level control and reliance on fine-tuning with task-specific demonstrations.

Method: VARL employs vision-language models to offer action suggestions to reinforcement learning agents, maintaining optimality and convergence while increasing sample diversity and efficiency.

Result: VARL demonstrated improved sample efficiency in diverse environments and agent settings without significant computational cost, particularly excelling in sparse-reward scenarios.

Conclusion: VARL's framework makes reinforcement learning more practical for real-world applications starting from scratch, proving to be a versatile tool for optimizing learning efficiency.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail is a self-evolving framework combining heterogeneous email graph analysis with Cognitive Graph Neural Networks and adversarial learning to detect advanced spam and phishing tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spam detection systems are ineffective against modern, adaptable, multi-modal phishing and spam campaigns.

Method: The paper introduces EvoMail, utilizing a heterogeneous email graph, a Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by LLMs, and an adversarial self-evolution loop for detection and adaptation.

Result: EvoMail outperformed existing spam detection baselines in accuracy, adaptability, and reasoning interpretability on real-world and adversarial datasets.

Conclusion: EvoMail offers a robust, explainable mechanism for defending against sophisticated and evolving spam/phishing threats in email systems.

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) as a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks in deep neural networks. It provides theoretical robustness guarantees and demonstrates empirical improvements over standard PCA in maintaining accuracy under attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations and the need to explore simple, data-adapted defenses to counter such attacks effectively.

Method: The authors compare standard PCA with SPCA for feature extraction, extend the study with theoretical robustness certificates for SPCA (both in linear and non-linear settings), and validate their claims through experiments with a small non-linear network.

Result: SPCA shows better robustness against adversarial attacks compared to PCA, both in theoretical robustness bounds and empirical tests, while retaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Sparsity in the projection reduces adversarial leverage, as supported by both theory and experiments. SPCA is identified as a better defense mechanism than PCA for adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAVA, a method to explain the spatial organization of unsupervised embeddings via input feature correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised models are valuable tools for scientific discovery but challenging to interpret, especially when the output is latent embeddings instead of predefined targets.

Method: LAVA analyzes unsupervised embeddings by treating them as neighborhoods and correlating input features to latent space structures, uncovering recurring patterns across the latent space.

Result: Using UMAP embeddings on MNIST and kidney cell data, LAVA identified feature associations and meaningful local patterns within latent spaces.

Conclusion: LAVA enables interpretability by focusing on local embedding structures, advancing unsupervised learning's explainability.

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

*Ruiyu Wang,Shizhao Sun,Weijian Ma,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAD-Tokenizer, a framework for improved text-guided CAD prototyping by using modality-specific tokens to better represent CAD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language model tokenizers fail to capture CAD-specific semantics, hindering effective modeling of geometric structures for text-guided CAD prototyping.

Method: CAD-Tokenizer employs a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding to create compact, primitive-aware representations of CAD data.

Result: CAD-Tokenizer significantly enhances instruction following and generation quality compared to general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed tokenization strategy aligns better with CAD's structural nature and successfully improves text-guided CAD prototyping performance, advancing the design pipeline.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

### [300] [GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21154)
*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the GRPO RL algorithm's hidden process reward model (PRM), identifies a flaw in its design, and proposes a modified $
\lambda$-GRPO for improved performance in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical and empirical functioning of GRPO as a process reward model and to address identified design flaws that hinder model performance and training efficiency.

Method: The authors theoretically demonstrate the presence of a hidden PRM in GRPO under specific token sequence conditions, empirically validate these conditions, identify flaws in the algorithm, and propose a modification called $
\lambda$-GRPO. They compare results using standard GRPO and $
\lambda$-GRPO.

Result: $
\lambda$-GRPO achieves higher validation accuracy, better downstream reasoning performance, and quicker peak performance compared to standard GRPO.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the need for expensive explicit PRMs in GRPO, arguing that leveraging the implicit PRM within GRPO can yield performance benefits with negligible cost and time impacts.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

### [301] [DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21161)
*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), a method addressing calibration in continual learning by adapting temperature scaling based on task proximity, without needing prior task information. It proves effective in reducing calibration errors across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve continual learning models by addressing task-calibration errors, ensuring reliable predictive uncertainty and minimizing catastrophic forgetting in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), integrating prototype-based distance estimation and adaptive temperature scaling to adjust calibration based on task proximity without requiring prior task information.

Result: Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks and real-world biomedical datasets show that the proposed DATS method consistently and reliably reduces calibration errors across tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: DATS provides a principled solution for task-specific calibration in continual learning, enhancing predictive reliability and addressing challenges in safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

### [302] [Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21164)
*Jacob Fein-Ashley,Dhruv Parikh,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a method enabling efficient collaboration among specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) using a lightweight global routing scheme and latent-level interactions, outperforming existing approaches without architectural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing specialization of open-source Large Language Models in domains like math, coding, and reasoning requires systems that can effectively leverage their complementary strengths for better performance.

Method: The proposed MoT technique employs a lightweight router to select top-K experts and uses interaction layers to project their hidden states into a shared latent space, enabling efficient collaboration through cross-attention by a primary expert. Training is done only on the router and interaction layers, keeping pre-trained models frozen.

Result: MoT demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Avengers across multiple benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy (+0.38% ID, +2.92% OOD) with runtime comparable to routing baselines and avoiding iterative aggregation overhead.

Conclusion: MoT provides a practical, efficient approach for combining heterogeneous LLMs in latent space, paving the way for broader multi-model collaboration with minimal operational complexity.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

### [303] [A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21167)
*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves machine unlearning in diffusion models for text-to-image tasks by generalizing MSE-based approaches into a flexible framework using $f$-divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to enhance understanding and capabilities in removing specific learned knowledge (machine unlearning) from text-to-image diffusion models, addressing challenges with limited existing methods based on MSE.

Method: The authors introduce a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, expanding on and generalizing the MSE approach for machine unlearning, allowing for diversification in divergence measures and their application.

Result: The framework demonstrates that different $f$-divergences affect algorithm convergence and unlearning quality, enabling flexibility in balancing unlearning goals and concept preservation.

Conclusion: The unified framework provides a customizable and superior approach to machine unlearning in diffusion models, enabling optimized results tailored to specific applications and trade-off preferences.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

### [304] [Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses time series anomaly detection (TSAD) with a novel model called TimeRCD, emphasizing a new pre-training paradigm (Relative Context Discrepancy) for improved zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing reconstruction-based objectives in TSAD, which fail to detect subtle anomalies and misinterpret complex normal patterns, resulting in high false positive and negative rates.

Method: Developed TimeRCD using the Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) paradigm, which detects anomalies by identifying discrepancies between adjacent time windows. Pre-training leveraged a large-scale synthetic dataset with token-level anomaly labels, using a standard Transformer architecture.

Result: TimeRCD outperformed state-of-the-art foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RCD approach.

Conclusion: The proposed RCD pre-training paradigm addresses critical limitations of existing TSAD methods and offers a robust, generalizable solution, establishing a new path for future TSAD models.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Differential-Integral Neural Operator (DINO), a novel deep learning framework that excels in long-term turbulence forecasting by capturing both local and global dynamics using separate operator branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, in long-term autoregressive predictions of turbulence, which often fail due to error accumulation and loss of physical fidelity.

Method: The method involves a new framework named DINO, which uses two parallel branches: a local differential operator (modeled by a constrained convolutional network) and a global integral operator (modeled by a Transformer architecture) to capture both local and global dynamics.

Result: DINO outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term turbulence forecasting on the 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark. It suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps and maintains high fidelity in vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: The physics-based decomposition in DINO makes it exceptionally stable and robust, setting a new benchmark for accurate and physically consistent long-range turbulence forecasts.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: The paper reviews how physics-informed machine learning can overcome challenges in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) by embedding physics into data-driven models for reliable predictions and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PHM systems face challenges such as noisy data, limited labels, and complex degradation behaviors. There is a need for models that can make reliable predictions despite these limitations.

Method: The study explores embedding physical constraints into models through learning biases (e.g., physics-informed loss functions, monotonicity) and observational biases (e.g., virtual sensing, data augmentation, sensor fusion). It also examines reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making and strategies for scaling solutions fleet-wide.

Result: Physics-informed approaches improve model consistency, enable active decision-making, and support scaling from single assets to fleets using techniques like meta-learning and domain generalization.

Conclusion: Embedding physics knowledge into machine learning enhances the reliability, scalability, and adaptability of PHM systems, enabling better maintenance optimization and decision-making.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

*Yuxiang Ji,Ziyu Ma,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Xiangxiang Chu,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-GRPO, a tree-based reinforcement learning method for improving large language model capabilities in multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods for large language models in long-term tasks encounter sparse supervision challenges when relying solely on outcome rewards.

Method: The Tree-GRPO method leverages tree search, where nodes represent complete interaction steps, enhancing rollout efficiency through prefix sharing and generating step-wise supervised signals from outcome rewards. It further estimates grouped relative advantages intra-tree and inter-tree.

Result: The Tree-GRPO method shows superior performance compared to chain-based RL methods, as validated across 11 datasets and 3 QA task types.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO improves the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for multi-turn agent interactions by addressing sparse supervision issues and enabling better performance through tree-based strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

*Yucheng Wang,Ziyang Chen,Md Faisal Kabir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs to explain the impact of fine-tuning on large language model (LLM) behaviors, focusing on structural and semantic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning alters the structural reasoning and semantic behavior of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors created BioToolKG, a specialized knowledge graph for bioinformatics tools, and developed an explainability tool (CFFTLLMExplainer) that applies counterfactual-based analysis with soft masks over knowledge graph nodes and edges to assess semantic divergence during fine-tuning.

Result: Applying the framework to a LLaMA-based LLM showed that counterfactual masking highlights the model's structural dependencies and aligns them with parameter changes induced by LoRA.

Conclusion: Counterfactual graphs are effective for interpreting changes in fine-tuned LLMs and offer a novel method for exploring structural dependencies and semantic behaviors in models.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

*Zifan Wang,Anqi Dong,Mahmoud Selim,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training generative models directly on distributed data under privacy constraints, achieving comparable performance to centralized methods while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The decentralized generation and storage of data, along with regulatory and privacy concerns, necessitates methods to train models on distributed data without centralizing it.

Method: The authors propose three FFM methods: FFM-vanilla for local training, FFM-LOT for locally optimal transport couplings, and FFM-GOT for a federated strategy using a shared global potential function for better data consistency.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and image datasets demonstrate that FFM enhances flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, balancing privacy and performance comparable to centralized baselines.

Conclusion: FFM shows promise as a privacy-preserving approach to training generative models on distributed data, addressing privacy constraints while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AirPCM, a deep spatiotemporal model for improved air pollution forecasting, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses global challenges to health, environment, and climate; accurate forecasts are needed to manage spatially complex pollution dynamics influenced by meteorological factors.

Method: AirPCM is a unified deep learning model that captures spatial correlations, temporal dependencies, and meteorology-pollutant causality for multi-region, multi-pollutant forecasting across diverse scales.

Result: AirPCM outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and generalization, effectively handling sudden pollution episodes and offering long-term forecasts.

Conclusion: AirPCM provides actionable insights for environmental governance and carbon mitigation, addressing global air pollution challenges efficiently and effectively.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO) to address the limitations of ratio clipping in reinforcement learning for training large language models and demonstrates significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome instability and information loss caused by ratio clipping in common reinforcement learning methods like PPO and GRPO for large language models.

Method: PSPO smooths the policy probabilities toward the old policy before computing the importance ratio, creating a soft trust region that maintains gradient signal while ensuring stability.

Result: PSPO significantly improves reasoning, conciseness, and generalisation abilities of fine-tuned Qwen models. It achieves a performance boost of over 20% compared to clipped GRPO, especially on the GSM8K dataset.

Conclusion: PSPO offers a more effective alternative to ratio clipping for stabilizing updates in reinforcement learning, leading to better model performance and reasoning logic in large language models.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

### [314] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for computing robust recourse recommendations in algorithmic decision-making systems under more constrained model changes using the $L^p$ norm. The method proves to be optimal and empirically outperforms prior work in cost and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of recourse recommendations becoming invalid when models are updated, and to improve upon existing methods that use the $L^\infty$ norm, which leads to costly solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a new algorithm that uses constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm (where $p \geq 1$ but $p \neq \infty$) to compute optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves significantly lower recourse costs, better trade-offs between cost and validity, and more sparse recourses compared to prior work, with resilience to post-processing for feasibility.

Conclusion: The new approach improves on existing robust recourse methods by offering lower costs, valid and sparse recommendations, and enhanced resilience under constrained model updates.

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to

### [315] [Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426)
*Mahmoud Samir Fayed*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of PWCT2, a general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language built using the textual programming language Ring, offering significant improvements in performance and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing general-purpose visual programming languages like PWCT by creating a self-hosting language that can improve itself and support broader usage.

Method: The authors designed and built Ring, a textual programming language, and then used the original PWCT to implement the Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine. Ring was subsequently utilized to develop the improved PWCT2 system.

Result: PWCT2 demonstrated significant enhancements, including being 36 times faster in code generation and requiring 20 times less storage for visual source files compared to PWCT. It also achieved broad user adoption through the Steam platform.

Conclusion: PWCT2 successfully serves as a faster, self-hosting visual programming language developed using its own ecosystem, encouraging further innovation in the domain and garnering positive user feedback.

Abstract: Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few
general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These
general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and
improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and
developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose,
self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically
designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring
is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering
syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific
languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming,
allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or
Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using
the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is
composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which
increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to
develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the
development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual
programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code
generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also
allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation
of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of
approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components.
PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received
positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the
total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research
and development.

### [316] [Efficient Symbolic Computation vis Hash Consing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20534)
*Bowen Zhu,Aayush Sabharwal,Songchen Tan,Yingbo Ma,Alan Edelman,Christopher Rackauckas*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Symbolic computation systems often store redundant subexpressions, causing memory inefficiencies. This paper adopts hash consing in JuliaSymbolics to optimize memory usage and computation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory inefficiencies and performance degradation caused by redundant storage in symbolic computation systems.

Method: Integrating hash consing within JuliaSymbolics using a global weak-reference hash table to canonicalize expressions and eliminate duplication.

Result: Benchmarks show 3.2x faster symbolic computation, 2x reduced memory usage, up to 100x faster numerical evaluation, and improved efficiency across key operations like differentiation and code generation.

Conclusion: Hash consing significantly scales symbolic computation, highlighting its importance for optimizing performance and paving the way for future integrations like e-graphs for enhanced mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to
redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as
expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra
and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present
the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance
symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that
canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces
memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation,
simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's
metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark
evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial
improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory
usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster,
function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100
times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate
unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in
initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits
significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in
scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash
consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in
AI-driven pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating semantic camera data with LiDAR segmentation to improve LiDAR-based localization in autonomous systems. It is validated using advanced networks and a comprehensive dataset from diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization in autonomous mobile systems, which faces challenges due to diverse sensor types and configurations.

Method: Integrates semantic data from cameras and LiDAR through projection into shared segmentation spaces, validated using CoCar NextGen platform, a Depth-Anything network, and GNSS-RTK-based ground truth.

Result: The method enhances precision and reliability in LiDAR-based localization, validated by testing in various real-world driving environments over 55 km in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach improves LiDAR-based localization accuracy, aiding the development of reliable autonomous navigation systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot framework for vision-language navigation in continuous environments using multimodal large language models with waypoint prediction and dynamic graph integration, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance the performance of embodied agents in the challenging task of vision-language navigation in continuous environments, which has practical applications in robotics.

Method: The method involves integrating a waypoint predictor operating on obstacle maps into a multimodal large language model, dynamically updating a topological graph with visitation records, and using this graph for spatial reasoning and exploration.

Result: Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show that the method achieves success rates of 41% and 36% in zero-shot scenarios, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves zero-shot performance in vision-language navigation, showcasing the capability of multimodal large language models combined with navigation-specific enhancements.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MELEGROS is a bioinspired soft robotic gripper designed with embedded optical sensors and pneumatic chambers in a single 3D-printed structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a seamless integration of actuation, sensing, and structure in soft robotics inspired by the distal morphology of elephant trunks.

Method: MELEGROS uses a monolithic design combining six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic chambers in a 3D-printed lattice structure made from a single soft resin.

Result: The gripper achieves diverse manipulative tasks, including lifting twice its weight, performing bioinspired movements, and handling delicate objects. The integrated sensors provide multifunctional perception.

Conclusion: MELEGROS introduces a new approach in soft robotics by incorporating sensing as an intrinsic feature of a continuous structure, enabling versatile and bioinspired manipulation.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

### [321] [Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20516)
*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for quadrupedal robots to clear paths in cluttered environments by pushing objects, even when the object becomes occluded from sensors during manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to autonomously navigate complex terrain, such as staircases, they must be able to physically interact with obstacles while addressing the challenges of constraints that arise during such interactions.

Method: The authors introduce an interaction-aware state estimation loop that combines proprioceptive feedback with a perception-action framework to predict object displacement and re-detect occluded objects during manipulation.

Result: Experiments on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better task success rates and object tracking accuracy compared to traditional open-loop control methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework allows quadrupedal robots to effectively handle occlusions during pushing tasks, enabling them to clear paths in challenging environments with higher reliability.

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [322] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPARQ, a method to request human feedback selectively during robot learning, significantly reducing feedback usage while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is beneficial for robot learning but is often limited and costly in real-world applications. Existing methods assume constant availability of feedback, which is impractical for physical robot deployment.

Method: The proposed SPARQ method uses a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only during learning stagnation or regression. It was tested on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task and compared with three baseline approaches.

Result: SPARQ demonstrated near-perfect task success while reducing the feedback budget by approximately 50%. It offered more stable and efficient learning compared to random querying and significantly improved over no feedback.

Conclusion: Progress-based selective querying (as in SPARQ) is a viable approach to make human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning more efficient and scalable, especially under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

TL;DR: GraspFactory introduces a dataset with over 109 million grasps for two grippers to enable better generalization in robotic grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for robots to handle a wide variety of objects in industrial settings, and the challenge of generalizing grasping models beyond limited datasets.

Method: Creation of a dataset called GraspFactory, comprising over 109 million 6-DoF grasps for diverse objects using two specific robotic grippers.

Result: The model trained on a subset of the dataset demonstrates generalization capabilities in simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: GraspFactory supports the development of generalizable robotic grasping models and is publicly available for further research and application.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

TL;DR: This study introduces an ROS-based framework for USVs to track marine pollution sources using real-time data while accounting for uncertainty, achieving high accuracy in simulated conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the urgent need for autonomous methods to quickly and accurately locate pollution sources in marine environments, enabling effective responses to environmental incidents.

Method: The study combines high-fidelity simulation of pollution dispersion with informative path planning techniques, leveraging real-time sensor data in ROS to iteratively refine probabilistic estimates of pollution source locations.

Result: Simulated experiments show that the proposed framework can accurately localize pollution sources under diverse conditions, demonstrating its reliability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work lays the foundation for fully autonomous environmental monitoring systems, advancing capabilities for rapid and accurate responses to marine pollution emergencies.

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

### [325] [Latent Activation Editing: Inference-Time Refinement of Learned Policies for Safer Multirobot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20623)
*Satyajeet Das,Darren Chiu,Zhehui Huang,Lars Lindemann,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Activation Editing (LAE), a method to enhance safety in reinforcement learning policies for quadrotor navigation by modifying activations at inference time, achieving substantial collision reductions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the infrequent but critical safety failures in well-trained reinforcement learning policies, especially in obstacle-rich environments. Retraining or fine-tuning to fix these issues can be costly and risk degrading existing performance.

Method: The proposed method has two stages: (i) an online classifier detects undesired behaviors using intermediate activations, and (ii) an activation editing module modifies these activations to shift into safer behavior regimes. A latent collision world model is used to amplify the perception of risk, prompting cautious responses.

Result: Experiments (simulation and real-world with Crazyflie drones) show that LAE reduces cumulative collisions by nearly 90% compared to a baseline and increases collision-free trajectories, all while maintaining task success.

Conclusion: LAE demonstrates itself as an effective and lightweight framework to enhance the safety of pre-trained robot policies at inference time without requiring architectural changes or retraining, making it feasible for resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots face challenges in achieving robust and agile locomotion across unstructured terrains, especially when terrain data is unavailable. This work aims to improve their performance under such blind locomotion settings.

Method: A hierarchical reinforcement learning framework is introduced, employing terrain-specialized policies and curriculum learning to improve tracking performance and agility.

Result: The framework showed a success rate improvement by up to 16% and reduced tracking errors at higher velocity targets in simulation tests. It particularly excelled on low-friction and discontinuous terrains.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning approach enhances adaptability and robustness for legged robots in mixed-terrain scenarios compared to generalist policies.

Abstract: Legged robots must exhibit robust and agile locomotion across diverse,

*Sun Zhaole,Xiaofeng Mao,Jihong Zhu,Yuanlong Zhang,Robert B. Fisher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Suction Leap-Hand (SLeap Hand), a robotic hand with fingertip suction cups, to overcome the challenges of anthropomorphic robotic design by enabling simpler, more stable in-hand manipulation and introducing new dexterous skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of anthropomorphic robotic hands, which constrain task capabilities and hinder data collection for learning-based methods due to complex force-closure grasps.

Method: Design and development of the SLeap Hand, a robotic hand with suction-enabled fingertips, allowing for stable, single-point adhesion and simplifying teleoperation and data collection.

Result: The SLeap Hand simplifies in-hand teleoperation, facilitates better demonstration data collection, and enables novel manipulation tasks such as one-handed paper cutting and in-hand writing.

Conclusion: Moving beyond anthropomorphic designs lowers barriers for robust manipulation data collection and unlocks capabilities for tasks that traditional or human-like hands cannot perform, demonstrating that novel embodiments can expand robotic manipulation functionalities.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

*Congkai Shen,Siyuan Yu,Yifan Weng,Haoran Ma,Chen Li,Hiroshi Yasuda,James Dallas,Michael Thompson,John Subosits,Tulga Ersal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study proposes a haptic shared control framework for teaching advanced driving skills by collaborating human drivers with autonomous systems, showing that it develops superior skills compared to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how haptic shared control impacts skill acquisition in demanding, high-performance driving tasks.

Method: Developed a cyber racing coach framework with an autonomous system for shared control and a fading mechanism to gradually reduce assistance, tested against self-learning and full-assistance benchmarks.

Result: Human subject studies demonstrated that the proposed framework facilitated superior racing skill development with enhanced performance and consistency.

Conclusion: Haptic shared control, integrated with adaptive training methods, is effective for advancing human skill acquisition in high-performance driving scenarios.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Motivation: To overcome limitations in current BCI-Robot systems, including noisy signals, inflexible target selection, and lack of closed-loop testing, and to provide a real-world solution for people with motor impairments.

Method: The study integrates motor imagery-based EEG decoding, AR neurofeedback, and robotic grasping within a closed-loop system. A 14-channel EEG headset is used for MI calibration, an AR interface supports multi-target navigation, and a robotic arm performs autonomous grasping.

Result: The system achieved 93.1% MI training accuracy, with an ITR of 14.8 bit/min. AR neurofeedback improved sustained control and ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared to baselines; closed-loop grasping success rate was 97.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed BCI-AR-Robot system demonstrates robust and reliable zero-touch operation with improved stability and efficacy, advancing assistive robotic technologies and human-robot interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Equi-RO demonstrates enhanced performance in odometry estimation, establishing dominance over existing methods in robustness and accuracy, showing viability for autonomous navigation in GPS-denied and challenging environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the

state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FINS, a method for reconstructing high-fidelity surfaces from minimal image input with faster training and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional implicit surface reconstruction methods require multi-view images and long training times, which are inefficient for certain applications.

Method: FINS uses a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight heads and an approximate second-order optimizer, supported by pre-trained models for single-image geometry estimation.

Result: FINS exceeds the performance of existing methods in speed and accuracy for surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation, and is applicable in robotic tasks.

Conclusion: FINS is an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity surface reconstruction, offering significant advances for single-image-based implicit representations in robotics.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

### [332] [RAM-NAS: Resource-aware Multiobjective Neural Architecture Search Method for Robot Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20688)
*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents RAM-NAS, a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search (NAS) method aimed at optimizing lightweight models for robotic edge hardware. It improves on supernet pretraining and includes latency considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NAS approaches struggle with supernet training and ignore real robot hardware constraints, prompting the development of a more resource-aware solution.

Method: The authors propose subnets mutual distillation, use Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss for better distillation, and train Latency Surrogate predictors for hardware-specific latency estimation. They perform evolutionary search to optimize accuracy and latency trade-offs.

Result: The RAM-NAS models achieved ImageNet top-1 accuracy between 76.7% and 81.4%, while reducing inference latency across robotic hardware. Experimental results on detection/segmentation tasks confirm scalability and reduced latency compared to MobileNetv3-based methods.

Conclusion: RAM-NAS provides a significant advancement by integrating hardware resource-awareness into NAS, improving both accuracy and latency for robotic edge hardware applications.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a walking model with ankles and feet, enhancing gait and stability compared to point-foot models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a more anthropomorphic walking model that includes ankle dynamics, improving understanding of human-like locomotion and stability mechanisms.

Method: The researchers introduced a human-inspired ankle dynamic paradigm into a reduced-order walking model, evaluating performance through gait characteristics and stability.

Result: The enhanced model demonstrated improved gait characteristics and stability. It managed large perturbations using a combination of foot placement and ankle strategies and small perturbations solely with ankle dynamics.

Conclusion: The model offers insights into human-like walking and stabilization, highlighting the role of proprioceptive ankle mechanisms in small perturbation stabilization.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

*Qingpeng Li,Chengrui Zhu,Yanming Wu,Xin Yuan,Zhen Zhang,Jian Yang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN is a framework combining pre-trained motion generation with reinforcement learning to achieve stable and smooth gaits in humanoid robots, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for humanoid locomotion struggle with stability, smoothness, and transitions from walking to running due to the need to simultaneously learn multiple tasks.

Method: The RuN framework decouples control tasks by using a Conditional Motion Generator for natural kinematic motion and a reinforcement learning policy for residual corrections.

Result: Simulations and tests on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot show smooth, natural motion transitions and improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both training and outcomes.

Conclusion: RuN provides an efficient solution for dynamic humanoid locomotion, enabling broad velocity ranges with stable and smooth gait transitions.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

### [335] [Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation from Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20703)
*Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO), a framework to align robot actions with object trajectories seen in human video demonstrations, addressing challenges of robot embodiment differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome embodiment disparity and joint constraints when using human video demonstrations to teach robots.

Method: JFTO uses probabilistic modeling and flow matching extended to SE(3), along with a unified optimization integrating grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision avoidance.

Result: JFTO was successfully validated in simulations and real-world tests for various manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective robot learning from human demonstrations while tackling embodiment and kinematic constraints.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

*Reza Akhavian,Mani Amani,Johannes Mootz,Robert Ashe,Behrad Beheshti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents BIM2RDT, an AI framework that converts static Building Information Models (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) to improve construction safety and enhance site operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitations of static BIM models by creating dynamic digital twins tailored for safety and efficiency in real-time construction environments.

Method: The framework integrates geometry and semantics from BIM, IoT sensor data, and robot-collected visual-spatial data, employing SG-ICP for point cloud registration, YOLOE for object detection, and HAV monitoring for safety adherence.

Result: The SG-ICP algorithm significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%–88.3%. HAV monitoring effectively flagged safety violations, demonstrating ISO compliance.

Conclusion: The study showcases an advanced AI-driven framework that bridges BIM and real-time construction data, improving site safety and operational accuracy.

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

*Mani Amani,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that combines natural language prompts with BIM-derived semantic maps using Bayesian fusion to guide robots along safer, context-aware paths in construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural language-based robotic mission planning in the construction domain by leveraging BIM data and language models for enhanced safety and context-awareness.

Method: A novel framework using Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion treats the output of large language models (LLMs) as sensor data. It combines repulsive coefficients for obstacles with LLM-calculated danger scores to adjust path-planning heuristics dynamically.

Result: Simulation results show improvements in robotic path robustness and validity, demonstrating better alignment with human prompts and environmental safety.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a numerically stable approach to incorporating multiple natural commands and can be flexibly integrated into various AI frameworks, enhancing robots' ability to navigate in construction settings.

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

*Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Yuan Meng,Xukun Li,Bo-Sheng Huang,Zhenshan Bing,Xinlong Wang,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RobotDancing, a framework to improve long-horizon motion tracking on humanoids by predicting residual joint targets using reinforcement learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids often fail due to accumulated errors from model-plant mismatch, necessitating a better solution.

Method: RobotDancing uses an end-to-end pipeline involving reinforcement learning for predicting residual joint targets. It features sim-to-sim validation and zero-shot sim-to-real deployment.

Result: The method performs well on Unitree G1 for multi-minute motion tracking and also transfers to other hardware (H1/H1-2), delivering high-quality tracking for complex motions.

Conclusion: RobotDancing enhances motion tracking robustness and scalability for humanoid robots, addressing dynamics discrepancies and achieving impressive real-world deployment.

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a SLAM-free navigation framework for legged robots using vision-language perception and semantic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of traditional SLAM systems under rapid motion, calibration issues, and sensor drift, while enabling better task-driven exploration via semantic reasoning.

Method: The proposed framework uses hierarchical vision-language perception for semantic inference and a semantic-probabilistic topological map for planning. Subgoal selection is handled by an LLM-based module, and RL-based locomotion controllers are used for robot control.

Result: The framework improves semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success in both simulations and real-world tests. Ablation studies confirm the importance of hierarchical perception and local planning.

Conclusion: This study presents a paradigm shift from geometry-based SLAM to semantics-driven navigation for legged robots.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASt3R-Fusion, a multi-sensor-assisted SLAM framework enhancing visual SLAM with feed-forward pointmap regression and complementary sensors for robust mapping and pose tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM struggles in challenging situations like low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and poor visual conditions, necessitating improvements in system robustness and accuracy.

Method: MASt3R-Fusion tightly integrates feed-forward neural network pointmap regression with inertial and GNSS sensor data using Sim(3)-based constraints within a hierarchical SE(3) factor graph for real-time and global optimization.

Result: The system demonstrates significant accuracy and robustness improvements in tests using public benchmarks and custom datasets compared to existing SLAM solutions.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion showcases enhanced visual SLAM capabilities by leveraging multi-sensor data and advanced optimization techniques, promising greater precision in robotics and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Motivation: Address challenges in applying multi-task reinforcement learning in robotics due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data.

Method: Proposes MT-Lévy, which incorporates behavior sharing and temporally extended exploration; dynamically adjusts exploration levels using policies from related tasks and task success ratios.

Result: Demonstrates improved exploration and sample efficiency in complex robotics environments with quantitative and qualitative evidence.

Conclusion: Combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies enhances practicality of MTRL for robotics.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

*Jiaxuan He,Jiamei Ren,Chongshang Yan,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SemSight proposes a probabilistic model for predicting room-level semantic structures in unexplored areas, outperforming existing methods in scene understanding and navigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient navigation and exploration require accurate prediction of semantic structures in unknown regions, which current methods lack.

Method: The paper introduces a probabilistic bird's-eye-view model that predicts structural layouts, global scene context, and target area distribution, using a mask-constrained encoder-decoder network trained on simulated exploration data.

Result: SemSight improves semantic prediction accuracy and enhances navigation performance in simulations, outperforming alternatives in Structural Consistency and Region Recognition Accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed model is effective for predicting scene semantics and optimizing robotic navigation, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency during exploration tasks.

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new action representation, Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK), to enhance end-to-end robot manipulation policies, addressing limitations in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of end-to-end neural networks in robotic manipulation, such as their current insufficiency for practical large-scale deployment.

Method: The proposed method uses a Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) as the action representation within a neural policy, trained in an end-to-end manner, to unify diverse manipulation tasks.

Result: Through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, the proposed CoMOK approach demonstrated high generalizability, accuracy, and applicability to challenging robotic tasks.

Conclusion: CoMOK improves robotic manipulation by enabling natural generalization to diverse objects, supporting multi-stage and multi-modal tasks, and achieving fine-grained precision.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and

TL;DR: MTRDrive introduces a framework combining memory-based experience retrieval and dynamic toolkits to enhance reasoning and decision-making for Vision-Language Models applied in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the fragility of Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving, which suffer from hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: The proposed method uses a closed-loop system integrating memory-based experience retrieval mechanisms with dynamic toolkits for improved environmental interactions, complemented by a Roadwork-VLM benchmark for evaluation.

Result: MTRDrive achieved state-of-the-art performance with high metrics in zero-shot and high-level planning evaluations on NAVSIM and Roadwork-VLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MTRDrive framework shows promise in bridging the reliability gap of autonomous driving models, advancing safe real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

*Xiaohan Ye,Kui Wu,Zherong Pan,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper connects issues in gradient behavior of differentiable simulators to contact model design and proposes an efficient and well-behaved contact model enabling success in many tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges caused by erratic or vanishing gradient information in differentiable simulators, which hinder gradient-based optimizers and downstream applications.

Method: It introduces a set of properties that ensure well-behaved gradient information in contact models and provides a practical, computationally-efficient contact model for differentiable rigid-body simulators.

Result: The proposed contact model enables discovering complex, contact-rich control signals and succeeds in various downstream tasks including locomotion and manipulation.

Conclusion: The study establishes guidelines for contact model design to improve gradient reliability in differentiable physics, with successful practical results in diverse applications.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

*Jianbo Zhao,Taiyu Ban,Xiangjie Li,Xingtai Gui,Hangning Zhou,Lei Liu,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel module and methodology to improve autoregressive models for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the spatio-temporal misalignment inherent in autoregressive models for autonomous driving, which limits their performance.

Method: The paper introduces a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module to correct worldview inconsistencies and uses kinematic action prediction for realistic trajectories. It also applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for more targeted post-training feedback.

Result: The proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art score of 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset, outperforming other autoregressive models.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations successfully enhance the performance and learning precision of autoregressive models, making them more viable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

TL;DR: AnywhereVLA presents a modular framework for mobile robotic manipulation in unseen environments using natural language input, achieving a 46% success rate under test conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to perform pick-and-place tasks in unpredictable indoor environments guided solely by natural language commands.

Method: The system is modular and integrates classical SLAM (using LiDAR and cameras), metric semantic mapping, and a custom exploration policy conditioned on parsed language inputs. A fine-tuned SmolVLA manipulation head enables object interaction, while all computational processes are executed on consumer-grade embedded hardware.

Result: The system demonstrated a 46% overall task success rate in static lab environments with normal human motion while running in real-time on embedded consumer hardware.

Conclusion: Integrating classical robotic navigation with language-conditioned manipulation leverages the strengths of both approaches, yielding a reliable and generalized system for diverse manipulation tasks guided by natural language.

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-layer framework for safe and efficient multi-robot electric vehicle battery disassembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the autonomy, precision, and safety of electric vehicle (EV) battery disassembly, which involves complex coordination between robots and reliable operations in challenging environments.

Method: The authors introduced a four-layer task-and-motion planning (TAMP) framework combining symbolic task planning, cost-aware allocation, a learned motion planner using TP-GMM, and real-time vision-based collaboration with tools like YOLOv8 and OctoMap.

Result: The proposed system delivered more effective performance compared to the baseline, reducing average end-effector path length by 63.3%, makespan by 8.1%, per-arm swept volumes significantly, and minimizing collision overlap by 47%.

Conclusion: The system enhances precision, motion efficiency, and collision safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in dynamic and unstructured environments, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in
unstructured, dynamic environments.

*Sibo Li,Qianyue Hao,Yu Shang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces KeyWorld, a system for faster and more physically plausible robotic world models by relying on semantic key frames for inference and lightweight inpainting for intermediate frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic world models often face slow inference speeds and fail to generate physically convincing trajectories due to redundant frame-by-frame generation and missing semantic emphasis of key transitions.

Method: KeyWorld identifies significant key frames through motion trajectory simplifications, trains a DiT model to reason and generate those from text, and uses a lightweight interpolator to reconstruct the intermediate frames.

Result: KeyWorld accelerates future environment state generation 5.68× faster than traditional methods and improves physical validity in complex tasks.

Conclusion: KeyWorld offers a feasible pathway for deploying real-time robotic world models by improving both inferential efficiency and physical plausibility, particularly in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Motivation: To address unpredictable forces caused by fuel sloshing during satellite docking, which challenges stability and control.

Method: The framework combines PPO and SAC reinforcement learning algorithms with Model Predictive Control, leveraging MPC for predictive accuracy to accelerate RL training.

Result: The SAC-MPC approach improves docking accuracy, success rates, and minimizes control efforts, outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach facilitates fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient autonomous docking, advancing on-orbit refueling and servicing operations.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Normalizing Flows Policy, a visuomotor model for robotics, offering efficient and trustworthy alternatives to diffusion models with faster inference and confidence measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of diffusion models in robotics, including high computational costs and lack of output uncertainty quantification, to improve model trustworthiness.

Method: The authors propose Normalizing Flows Policy, leveraging normalizing flows for efficient visuomotor policy learning with confidence estimation.

Result: The model demonstrated comparable or superior performance to diffusion models in robotic tasks, achieved higher sample efficiency, and enabled up to 30x faster inference.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows Policy is a trustworthy and efficient alternative to diffusion models for general-purpose robotics, validated through experiments and ablations.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and computational demands of radar and vision-based methods for environmental edge detection in drones.

Method: The proposed AirTouch system uses the ground effect as a sensing modality. It analyzes drone attitude sensor readings and flight commands to detect material boundaries without compromising flight stability.

Result: AirTouch demonstrated high detection accuracy with a mean error of 0.051m. Evaluations show an 86% improvement over baseline methods while consuming only 43 mW of power.

Conclusion: AirTouch provides an innovative and resource-efficient approach to edge detection in drones, making it a practical solution for low-cost, lightweight, and efficient operations.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrossInstruct, a novel framework enabling robots to learn behaviors from cross-modal instructions, including free-form annotations, instead of physical motion demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot teaching methods, reliant on motion demonstrations, are challenging to scale and cumbersome to collect. The paper explores a new paradigm using rough annotations to instruct robots.

Method: CrossInstruct integrates cross-modal instructions into a vision-language model (VLM) as input examples. The VLM synthesizes robot motion iteratively, combining reasoning from a large model with outputs from a smaller model, ultimately fusing 2D views into 3D motion trajectories.

Result: CrossInstruct demonstrated effective robot behavior generalization and strong initialization for reinforcement learning tasks, tested on benchmark simulations and real hardware.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables scalable robot learning from rough annotations, bridging foundational and fine-tuned models to provide executable behaviors and reinforcement learning boosts.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore advanced methods, specifically reinforcement learning, for solving drone-based tasks like balancing a ball on a movable beam, surpassing traditional control strategies.

Method: The authors use a hierarchical control framework to separate high-level decision-making (trained with reinforcement learning) from low-level drone control.

Result: Simulation results indicate that the reinforcement learning policy outperforms PID controllers, exploiting richer state observations to enhance performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning's success is attributed to its ability to leverage comprehensive state data, highlighting the importance of improved sensing for controlling complex systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automotive-ENV, a benchmark for vehicle GUI interactions, and proposes ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent. Location-based context enhances safety-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-vehicle GUI interactions are underexplored despite challenges such as driver attention limitations and safety requirements. The paper aims to advance this field.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark (Automotive-ENV) with 185 tasks for vehicle GUI interactions and created ASURADA, which incorporates GPS context for actionable decision-making in automotive systems.

Result: Tests demonstrate that utilizing geo-aware information improves task success rates, particularly in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: Location-based context is critical for improving the performance of in-vehicle agents. The resources are being released to encourage further research.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

*Md Faizal Karim,Vignesh Vembar,Keshab Patra,Gaurav Singh,K Madhava Krishna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAGDiff is a framework for dual-arm robotic grasping that ensures stability and collision safety by guiding a diffusion process without prior heuristics or explicit region detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-arm grasping is pivotal for manipulating large and complex objects, but ensuring stability, preventing collisions, and enabling generalization remain challenging using traditional methods.

Method: The system uses a diffusion-based generative framework in SE(3) x SE(3) space, guided by geometry, stability, and collision-aware terms to generate force-closure-compliant grasp pairs.

Result: DAGDiff improves over previous methods in force-closure and collision metrics, validated via physics-based simulations, collision analysis, and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: This approach provides robust, generalized dual-arm grasping by directly operating on point clouds of novel objects, demonstrating reliability in real-world manipulations.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasonNav, a navigation system for robots that imitates human-like behaviors, such as reading signs and asking for directions, to navigate large environments more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with efficient navigation in large, unfamiliar settings compared to humans who use strategies like interpreting signs or asking for directions.

Method: Developed ReasonNav, a modular navigation system that incorporates a vision-language model (VLM) with inputs and outputs designed around navigation landmarks to improve language understanding and reasoning.

Result: ReasonNav demonstrated higher-order reasoning skills and navigated efficiently in complex, large buildings in both real and simulated tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating human-inspired reasoning behaviors via VLM enables robots to achieve more effective navigation, addressing existing inefficiencies in robot systems.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

*Ali Kafili Gavgani,Amin Talaeizadeh,Aria Alasty,Hossein Nejat Pishkenari,Esmaeil Najafi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores new drone configurations that overcome conventional multi-rotors' limitation of linking attitude and position control, introducing omniorientational systems with efficient controllers and battery optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-rotor drones lack the ability to independently control attitude and position, limiting their versatility and control precision.

Method: New drone configurations with additional control inputs were proposed and their dynamics modeled using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers—sliding mode and a novel PID-based—were developed for robust and efficient operation.

Result: The proposed drone configurations performed well under disturbances, demonstrated power efficiency, and provided robust control. The study identified configurations and controllers that optimize battery life and handle uncertainties effectively.

Conclusion: This research offers a roadmap for designing omniorientational drones, providing configuration and controller insights to future researchers, and addresses key limitations in multi-rotor drones.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

*Jaehwi Jang,Zhuoheng Wang,Ziyi Zhou,Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for stabilizing the arm end-effector of bipedal robots, combining model-enhanced residual learning and reinforcement learning to improve adaptability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stabilizing bipedal robot end-effectors is challenging due to high degrees of freedom, dynamic instability, and real-world disturbances like friction and backlash, which degrade the performance of model-based controllers, while learning-based methods struggle to generalize.

Method: The method introduces a Stable End-Effector Control (SEEC) framework that uses model-enhanced residual learning in conjunction with reinforcement learning and a perturbation generator to compensate for lower-body disturbances and adapt to unseen conditions without retraining.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in simulations and real-world experiments using the Booster T1 robot, demonstrating robust handling of diverse loco-manipulation tasks and adaptability to new scenarios.

Conclusion: The SEEC framework enables precise, robust end-effector control, improving upon existing methods by better generalizing to real-world conditions and unseen locomotion controllers while requiring no additional bodywide retraining.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

*Yutong Li,Jieyi Zhang,Wenqiang Xu,Tutian Tang,Cewu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FSGlove is an advanced hand motion capture system providing high-resolution tracking for 48 DoFs and personalized hand shape reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hand MoCap systems have limited DoF tracking and often neglect personalized hand shape variations, critical for tasks requiring high dexterity.

Method: FSGlove uses IMUs on each finger joint and dorsum for motion sensing, with the DiffHCal method integrating parametric MANO models via differentiable optimization for calibration.

Result: FSGlove achieves joint angle errors below 2.7 degrees, surpassing commercial systems in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity, bridging human dexterity with robotic imitation.

Conclusion: FSGlove delivers precise tracking and shape reconstruction, open-source adaptability, and compatibility with VR/robotics, advancing hand tracking for nuanced motions and applications.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

*Jiyeon Koo,Taewan Cho,Hyunjoon Kang,Eunseom Pyo,Tae Gyun Oh,Taeryang Kim,Andrew Jaeyong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, RetoVLA, which reuses Register Tokens to improve spatial reasoning capability without adding significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models excel in robotics but are computationally expensive, which hinders their real-world deployment. Lightweighting typically compromises important spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors propose RetoVLA, which reuses discarded Register Tokens initially designed for artifact removal in Vision Transformers. These tokens are directly integrated into the Action Expert module to enhance spatial reasoning.

Result: RetoVLA demonstrates a 17.1% absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks on a custom 7-DOF robot arm, showing the effectiveness of reusing Register Tokens.

Conclusion: Reusing Register Tokens adds spatial reasoning capabilities to VLA models, bridging the trade-off between efficiency and performance. What was previously discarded proves instrumental for advancing robotic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

### [363] [BiNoMaP: Learning Category-Level Bimanual Non-Prehensile Manipulation Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21256)
*Huayi Zhou,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study focuses on advancing non-prehensile manipulation in robotics by proposing a dual-arm framework (BiNoMaP) and an RL-free approach to enable efficient, versatile, and general manipulation of objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation is vital but underexplored in robotics due to its complexity and analytical challenges. This paper aims to address this gap, moving beyond traditional single-arm designs and RL-based methods.

Method: The method involves a dual-arm configuration, extracting bimanual motion trajectories from video, refining these via geometry-aware post-optimization, and parameterizing them with object-relevant attributes for category-level generalization.

Result: The authors validate the approach across various bimanual tasks and object categories, showcasing BiNoMaP's effectiveness, adaptability, and superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: BiNoMaP offers a novel direction for robotics, enabling complex bimanual non-prehensile manipulation tasks with minimal reliance on RL and demonstrating generalizability across objects and tasks.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

### [364] [\LARGE GMP$^{3}$: Learning-Driven, Bellman-Guided Trajectory Planning for UAVs in Real-Time on SE(3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21264)
*Babak Salamat,Dominik Mattern,Sebastian-Sven Olzem,Gerhard Elsbacher,Christian Seidel,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMP³, a framework for planning 3D trajectories for UAVs that incorporates both positional and rotational dynamics in cluttered spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve UAV trajectory planning by addressing both translational and rotational dynamics in environments with obstacles.

Method: They use the Lie group SE(3) for trajectory representation, a modified Bellman operator for RL updates, and a consensus scheme for distributed planning among UAVs.

Result: The proposed framework successfully generates dynamically feasible paths and performs well in simulations and indoor flights, showcasing reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework enhances UAV path planning by uniting translation and rotation dynamics, supporting real-time deployment via DroneManager software.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

*Luis Augenstein,Noémie Jaquier,Tamim Asfour,Leonel Rozo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GPHDM, a model that generates human-like robot motions by learning latent spaces preserving motion hierarchy and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation models often overlook the hierarchical structure of human motions derived from biomechanics, leading to less natural outcomes.

Method: GPHDM extends the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model to a hyperbolic space with taxonomy-aware biases, enabling structured and consistent motion generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GPHDM effectively encodes motion hierarchies and dynamics, generating realistic and physically consistent motion sequences.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust way to merge hierarchical taxonomies and temporal dynamics for more human-like robotic motion generation.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM introduces fine-tuned LLMs and a dataset to aid in generating OpenACC directives, improving accuracy and automation for GPU programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU programming frameworks remain complex despite directive-based standards like OpenACC. Expertise is still needed for effective usage, motivating the creation of tools to simplify and automate OpenACC directive generation.

Method: Two LLMs were fine-tuned using a supervised dataset containing OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from GitHub repositories (4,033 pairs, split into training and testing sets). Evaluation compared base LLMs and fine-tuned models.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs generated correct OpenACC directives 87% of the time for data-parallel loops and exact matches in 50% of cases. They outperformed base models, even producing directives with additional practical utility.

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM lowers barriers for GPU offloading by improving directive generation, establishes benchmarks, and provides resources for reproducibility in automated OpenACC usage.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of traditional methods for analyzing complex cybersecurity issues and propose innovative visualization techniques.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of over 60 key research papers to create a taxonomy of software security visualization techniques and explore their applications.

Result: Two main areas were identified: extensive software development visualization and operational/cybersecurity visualization. Practical implications include enhanced threat detection and security strategies.

Conclusion: Innovative visualization techniques are essential to adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, offering insights into future research and security practices.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tool selection and management in environments with hundreds or thousands of tools that cannot be loaded simultaneously due to computational constraints.

Method: Developed five architectural approaches focusing on 'search-and-load' mechanisms to achieve dynamic and efficient tool selection while optimizing computational resources.

Result: The proposed method reduced tool loading by 50% while maintaining task completion accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach advances the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of adapting dynamically to a wide range of tools and tasks.

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of knowledge graphs to aid in specifying and verifying fairness requirements in software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address discrimination in software systems which primarily arises from poorly defined or verified fairness requirements.

Method: They propose using a knowledge graph-based framework to formalize fairness requirements, inspired by successful applications in domains like security engineering.

Result: The paper outlines challenges, research questions, and a roadmap for developing fairness-verifying mechanisms using knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: A knowledge graph-based approach could enable better specification and verification of fairness requirements, helping reduce discriminatory practices in software systems.

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-based chatbot for programming education, which combines multiple techniques for effective learning. It achieves an 85% success rate in debugging and improves coding skills significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between traditional debugging tools and AI code assistants, which either lack interactivity or focus solely on productivity rather than education.

Method: The chatbot integrates static code analysis, dynamic tracing, and LLMs like CodeLlama and GPT-4. It uses sandboxing with Docker for secure code execution and was tested on a dataset of student submissions.

Result: The system achieved an 85% error resolution success rate, reduced debugging time by 59.3%, and improved coding proficiency by 34%. Feedback highlighted its clarity and confidence-building impact, with minor critiques on latency.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates how AI tools can balance innovation with educational needs, providing a framework for fostering understanding and skill retention in programming education.

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online-Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a method to improve embeddings alignment for better tool use and function calling by adapting embeddings during deployment using minimal feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many RAG systems suffer from misalignment in embeddings due to imperfect models or noisy descriptions, leading to retrieval errors and task failures.

Method: The authors propose a plug-and-play framework using online gradient updates during deployment to fine-tune embeddings based on live interactions and minimal feedback, without altering the underlying language model.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in tool selection accuracy and task success across diverse scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Online-Optimized RAG offers a practical solution for building robust and adaptive RAG systems, enhancing reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for formal verification mechanisms for legal contracts, specifically focusing on enforceable properties involving asset transfers and obligations.

Method: The authors propose translating Stipula contracts into Java code with Java Modeling Language specifications and then leveraging the KeY deductive verification tool to automatically verify both partial and total correctness for a specific subset of contracts.

Result: The proposed translation and verification process is automated for Stipula contracts with disjoint cycles, demonstrating the feasibility of using a general-purpose deductive verification tool effectively.

Conclusion: The study validates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool like KeY can be successfully utilized for verifying the correctness of translated domain-specific Stipula contracts.

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

### [374] [PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497)
*Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies the self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in systems integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI and LangChain and analyzes its origins, prevalence, and solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the emerging technical challenges and maintenance burdens (SATD) in software systems that embed LLMs to promote better management and system sustainability.

Method: Analyzed 93,142 Python files incorporating major LLM APIs to identify the sources, prevalence, and mitigation strategies for LLM-specific technical debts. Investigated prompt design as a primary debt source.

Result: Found OpenAI (54.49%) and LangChain (12.35%) integrations as major sources of SATD. Identified prompt design issues (6.61%) and hyperparameter issues as primary contributors. Instruction-based and few-shot prompts were particularly debt-prone.

Conclusion: LLM integration introduces significant technical debt, with prompt design as a major factor. Sharing a SATD dataset and proposed strategies can help mitigate the challenges and improve LLM-based system functionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

### [375] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study presents FaR-Loc, a framework integrating LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation to enhance method-level fault localization in software debugging, outperforming existing baselines in accuracy benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent large language models show promise in fault localization but face challenges with project-specific knowledge and large systems; this work aims to address these gaps.

Method: The proposed FaR-Loc framework includes three components: creating natural language descriptions of failures using LLMs, semantic dense retrieval using pre-trained code encoders, and re-ranking of retrievals for relevance using LLMs.

Result: FaR-Loc achieves significant gains in fault localization accuracy, outperforming existing methods (SoapFL and AutoFL) by 9.1%-14.6% (Top-1) and 19.2%-22.1% (Top-5), and improves fault localization with code structure-aware models by up to 49%.

Conclusion: FaR-Loc demonstrates superior fault localization capability without re-training, providing a viable and advanced solution for debugging complex software systems.

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

*Daniela Grassi,Fabio Calefato,Darja Smite,Nicole Novielli,Filippo Lanubile*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies engagement patterns in hybrid meetings, comparing remote and co-located participants, using biometric and questionnaire data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in communication and collaboration caused by the shift to hybrid work structures post-COVID-19, which can lead to remote employee isolation.

Method: A multimodal approach using self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements via biometric devices during hybrid meetings, observing professionals from three software companies over several weeks.

Result: Engagement levels are similar between remote and onsite participants, but remote participants show lower engagement in long meetings. Active roles enhance engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions reduce it.

Conclusion: Findings reveal factors influencing hybrid meeting engagement and offer recommendations for improvement, applicable across software teams and other knowledge-intensive organizations.

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

### [378] [Verification Limits Code LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837)
*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines how the design and strategy of verification impact the performance of code generation models, emphasizing that overly rigid verification filters out diversity and can limit training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the scalability and quality of training data for code generation models constrained by synthetic verifiers' capabilities.

Method: The paper systematically studies test complexity, quantity, relaxed pass thresholds, and the importance of diverse correct training data using controlled experiments.

Result: Enhanced code generation performance was observed (+2-4 pass@1), especially with relaxed verification thresholds and richer test suites. Gains depend heavily on the diversity and strength of test cases.

Conclusion: Rigid verification strategies limit model performance. A recalibrated approach integrating diverse problem-solution pairs and adjustable thresholds can overcome the 'verification ceiling.'

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

*Yixuan Li,Xinyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Mingjie Zhou,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes PseudoBridge, a framework using pseudo-code as an intermediate step to improve code retrieval by aligning natural language semantics with programming logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle existing challenges in code search such as the semantic gap between natural language and programming languages and the limited robustness to varying code styles.

Method: The method introduces PseudoBridge, which leverages a large language model to generate pseudo-code as an intermediate modality, employs logic-invariant code style augmentation, and aligns diverse code styles with pseudo-code for better robustness.

Result: PseudoBridge outperforms baseline methods across 6 programming languages and 10 PLMs, showing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy, generalization, and zero-shot domain transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: PseudoBridge effectively bridges the semantic gap and improves robustness in code retrieval, offering a promising solution for accurate and generalizable code search.

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CodeHinter, a debugging assistant that integrates LLMs and traditional tools to help novice programmers fix semantic errors and remain actively engaged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of active student participation in debugging when relying on existing AI-assisted tools.

Method: The authors developed CodeHinter, iteratively designed and tested with undergraduate students, combining LLMs with traditional debugging methods.

Result: Results showed that students found the tool effective for resolving semantic errors and easier to use compared to its earlier version, with error localization being the most helpful feature.

Conclusion: AI-assisted debugging tools should be tailored to user profiles for optimal interaction and engagement.

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

TL;DR: Researchers analyzed quantum-related Q&A discussions on Stack Overflow using transformer algorithms like BERT. They categorized these into common challenges, achieving high accuracy in classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and QSE concepts, and improved categorization of their discussions can help address recurring issues.

Method: The study used content analysis, grounded theory, and AI models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) to classify 2829 quantum-tagged posts into challenge categories. ChatGPT helped validate human annotations, and SHAP was utilized for model interpretation.

Result: Transformer algorithms classified discussions with 95% accuracy, outperforming traditional machine learning models (accuracy up to 89%). SHAP revealed linguistic factors driving predictions.

Conclusion: Effective categorization of quantum-related discussions improves readability and access for quantum developers, though real-world validation with vendors and developers is needed.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought fine-tuning approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve automated code review performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations in current LLM-based code review methods, which lack multi-dimensional reasoning and suffer from context and logic loss in processing long prompts.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning LLMs using a chain-of-thought (COT) approach paired with Maximum Entropy modeling and pre-defined reasoning pathways to enhance reasoning depth and logical consistency.

Result: Empirical evaluation reveals that MelcotCR significantly boosts performance, enabling even low-parameter models to match or exceed state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting and describing code issues.

Conclusion: MelcotCR expands the reasoning capability of LLMs for code review by employing rich structured information and addressing reasoning logic limitations, offering a scalable and effective solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve processing of public engagement data on digital platforms for policymaking using BERTopic, seed words, and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underutilization of citizen-input data on digital government platforms, which often remains unorganized due to scale, expertise requirements, and taxonomy alignment issues.

Method: The authors combine BERTopic, seed words, and automatic validation by large language models to generate coherent and institutionally aligned topics with minimal human intervention.

Result: Preliminary results show that the proposed method produces cohesive and policy-aligned topics efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed approach allows governments to effectively utilize public input on a large scale, transforming it into actionable public policy data.

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the link between subjective cognitive concerns and neural dynamics in speech perception, highlighting weaker cortical tracking of linguistic features in older adults with greater cognitive concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore early signs of cognitive impairment in subjective cognitive decline through the lens of speech perception and neural dynamics.

Method: EEG was used to analyze cortical tracking of auditory features in 56 cognitively normal older adults (aged 60-70) listening to speech stimuli with varying prosody.

Result: The study found weaker cortical tracking of higher-level linguistic features in individuals with greater cognitive concerns, especially in less engaging or prosodically flat speech.

Conclusion: Cortical tracking during speech perception can serve as an early biomarker to detect cognitive impairment in individuals with subjective cognitive decline.

Abstract: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) approximately doubles the risk of
progressing to MCI and dementia. The present study investigates how one's
subjective concerns of his/her own cognition are manifested in the neural
dynamics during speech perception. EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese,
cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli
of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive,
dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from
acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater
subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1)
higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less
engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich
stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment
can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while
listening to prosodically flat speech.

Abstract: We develop a new high-dimensional statistical learning model which can take
advantage of structured correlation in data even in the presence of randomness.
We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of

*Khai Nguyen,Hai Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method to estimate Wasserstein distances for multiple distribution pairs using sliced Wasserstein distances as predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiency of calculating Wasserstein distances across multiple distribution pairs, especially when dealing with limited data.

Method: The authors propose two linear regression models (one unconstrained and one constrained) that leverage both standard and lifted sliced Wasserstein distances as predictors for Wasserstein distance.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms the existing Wasserstein Wormhole model in terms of accuracy, particularly in low-data scenarios, and is validated on diverse datasets like MNIST point clouds and ShapeNetV2.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and accurate way to estimate Wasserstein distances, significantly improving computational efficiency and even enhancing the training of existing models like Wasserstein Wormhole.

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for
multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we
propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on
sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW
distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide
upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure
parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a
closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half
as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small
number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the
Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of
SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach
on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and
Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets
such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our
method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance
than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole,
particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator
can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

*Chao Ying,Jun Jin,Haotian Zhang,Qinglong Tian,Yanyuan Ma,Yixuan Li,Jiwei Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsupervised domain adaptation when a subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable, deriving prediction models, proposing an estimation method, and demonstrating superiority over naive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in domain adaptation due to missing subpopulations in the source domain, which can cause biased predictions and poor performance.

Method: The authors derive prediction models for the target domain and propose a distribution matching method to estimate subpopulation proportions, accompanied by theoretical guarantees.

Result: Their method improves predictive performance and outperforms naive benchmarks in synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Missing subpopulations in domain adaptation can be effectively handled using their theoretical approach and distribution matching method, with improved accuracy over naive estimations.

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain
consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary
background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one
such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this
unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive
performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction
in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive
both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain.
For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to
estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for
the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the
prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show
that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this
unobservable source subpopulation.

*Zeyu Jia,Yury Polyanskiy,Alexander Rakhlin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of gapped scale-sensitive dimensions and demonstrates their application in bounding covering numbers and improving lower bounds in learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize existing results on bounding covering numbers for function classes and strengthen lower bounds in learning rates.

Method: The authors utilize theoretical analysis to establish the connection between gapped scale-sensitive dimensions, covering numbers, and offset Rademacher averages.

Result: They show that gapped dimensions upper-bound covering numbers and provide stronger lower bounds on rates of convergence in learning contexts.

Conclusion: The study enhances theoretical understanding by extending known results and improving methodologies for bounding learning rates and covering numbers.

Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both
sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers
for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped
dimensions, generalizing the results of
\cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped
dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby
strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of
convergence in statistical and online learning.

*Joaquim Valerio Teixeira,Ed Reznik,Sudpito Banerjee,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable Bayesian framework to analyze spatial data from biological imaging technologies like IMS and IMC, improving signal recovery and tissue structure identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convolution of molecular signals in pixels during spatial data analysis from methods like IMS or IMC complicates accurate signal recovery, requiring improved computational techniques.

Method: The authors employ a Bayesian approach using a heavy-tailed graphical lasso prior and a hierarchical variational family to enable efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference.

Result: Simulation results indicate superiority over current point estimate methodologies and better posterior coverage over mean-field variational inference. Real data application confirms improved anatomical structure recovery, artifact removal, and detection of active regions.

Conclusion: This scalable Bayesian method enhances precision in spatial signal analysis, offering significant improvements over existing practices in biological imaging technologies.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging
because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from
molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian
framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover
relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on
the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel
hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic
differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS,
and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference
techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better
recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and
detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

*Wandi Xu,Wei Xie*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAPTOR-GEN, a Bayesian learning framework to enhance biopharmaceutical manufacturing by integrating multi-scale probabilistic modeling and efficient posterior sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing lacks the flexibility for rapid, on-demand production due to the complexity and variability of its processes. There is a need for innovative computational frameworks to intelligently interpret sparse and diverse experimental data.

Method: RAPTOR-GEN is based on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph formulated with stochastic differential equations. It incorporates a metamodel with linear noise approximation and sequential learning strategies, alongside an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method leveraging Langevin diffusion.

Result: RAPTOR-GEN successfully infers latent state variables, performs robust parameter learning, and effectively uncovers regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: RAPTOR-GEN offers a fast and reliable solution for intelligent biopharmaceutical manufacturing, showcasing robust computational methods for improving process understanding and efficiency.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the
agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the
complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce
RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning
framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from
sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a
multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the
nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i)
an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that
exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a
sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling
inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the
intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior
sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior
exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It
generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size
selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable
finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN
algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of
biomanufacturing processes.

### [391] [Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20928)
*Yanfeng Yang,Siwei Chen,Pingping Hu,Zhaotong Shen,Yingjie Zhang,Zhuoran Sun,Shuai Li,Ziqi Chen,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen) to improve probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series by leveraging conditional priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. Existing models often ignore useful prior information such as conditional means and covariances.

Method: The authors propose CW-Gen, a framework that incorporates conditional whitening to enhance sample quality. They design a Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) for estimating conditional mean and covariance simultaneously. They integrate JMCE into Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and Flow Matching (CW-Flow).

Result: CW-Gen improves predictive performance on five real-world datasets versus six state-of-the-art models. It captures non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable dependencies more effectively and mitigates distribution shift.

Conclusion: By incorporating informative priors and leveraging conditional whitening, CW-Gen provides a more robust approach for multivariate time series forecasting compared to prior-free models.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to
non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While
recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore
informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we
propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that
incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we
establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal
distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with
a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the
conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this
analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that
simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance.
Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models
(CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow).
Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative
models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance,
capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more
effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate
that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

### [392] [Empirical PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20985)
*Vahe Karagulyan,Pierre Alquier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: New PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains with empirical estimations enabled by pseudo-spectral gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds for temporally dependent data rely on unknown constants tied to the data-generating process.

Method: Introduced a PAC-Bayes bound dependent on the pseudo-spectral gap and demonstrated its empirical estimation for finite state spaces.

Result: The empirical version of the bound matches the tightness of the non-empirical bound in simulations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains, expanding generalization theory for dependent data.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations.
Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal
dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on
properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time,
spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove
a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity
called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an
empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite.
Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains.
This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional
assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is
essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores an optimal way to utilize large language models (LLMs) through majority voting and adaptive test strategies, extending to weighted ensembles for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of large language models' outputs by overcoming limitations like infinite test-time budgets associated with best-of-$N$ methods.

Method: The study analyzes majority-vote-based best-of-$N$ limits ($N \to \infty$), introduces an adaptive scheme for dynamic $N$ selection, and extends to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs. It uses a mixed-integer linear program for optimal ensemble weighting.

Result: They show that adaptive generation schemes optimize inference-time computation and that weighted ensembles outperform individual LLM models.

Conclusion: Adaptive and weighted ensemble approaches can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM outputs, addressing computation budget constraints while boosting performance.

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is
based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$,
which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive
performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address
this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer
agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond
adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs,
showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal
ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer
linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Soham Bonnerjee,Sayar Karmakar,Subhrajyoty Roy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of localizing watermarked segments within mixed-source texts and introduces WISER, a computationally efficient watermark segmentation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance text authenticity verification by addressing the underexplored problem of identifying specific watermarked text segments robustly and efficiently.

Method: The authors propose WISER, a watermark segmentation algorithm inspired by epidemic change-point detection. The algorithm is validated theoretically with finite sample error-bounds and consistency proofs, and empirically tested on benchmark datasets.

Result: WISER outperforms existing methods in computational speed and accuracy across diverse watermarking schemes, supported by extensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study presents WISER as a theoretically grounded and efficient tool for watermark localization, showcasing how classical statistical insights can address modern challenges.

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over
content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking
schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an
appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The
corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical
hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research
in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which
segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less
explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical
guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a
unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of
epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences
of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally
efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our
algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its
consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text.
Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments
show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of
computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded
with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings
establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most
settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can
lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a
modern and pertinent problem.

*Alexis Ayme,Bruno Loureiro*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates minimal structural assumptions needed to prevent high-dimensional learning degradation, focusing on linear predictors, and provides bounds for generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine structural assumptions required to avoid degradation of statistical learning performance in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The authors examine generalization properties of linear prediction rules, deriving upper and lower bounds for generalization error, under the assumption that the Bayes predictor is in an ellipsoid.

Result: They provide analytical insights into generalization error, separating it into variance-like and noiseless error terms, especially significant in high-dimensional scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of structural assumptions in addressing the curse of dimensionality, offering a deeper understanding of data intrinsic dimensionality and error behavior.

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural
assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning
bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the
classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear
observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the
generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed
as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)
Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --
encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,
including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower
bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the
Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower
bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when
the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental
contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic
dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises
specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the
role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

*Andrew Gordon Wilson,Zhiting Hu,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper challenges a claim from Ober et al. (2021) that the complexity penalty dominates kernel hyperparameter determination. Instead, it asserts the continued importance of balancing data fit and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potentially misleading conclusions from Ober et al.'s discussion regarding the role of complexity penalties and data fit terms in Gaussian processes kernel learning.

Method: The authors re-examine the reparametrization of the kernel involving signal variance and introduce an additional data-fit term to analyze its influence on kernel hyperparameters in Gaussian processes.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the reparametrization adds an influencing data-fit factor, thereby providing evidence that both data fit and complexity penalty are still relevant.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a balanced consideration of data fit and complexity penalty remains crucial in determining kernel hyperparameters, contrary to Ober et al.'s claim.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober
et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be
compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al.
(2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance
coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of
this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use
this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the
kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel
hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show
that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which
influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit
and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel
hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), which uses natural language commands to improve user satisfaction and system effectiveness in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems fail to capture nuanced user motivations and specific attributes driving satisfaction. This causes a gap between user intentions and system functionality.

Method: The IRF paradigm introduces natural language commands in recommendation feeds, supported by RecBot, a dual-agent system comprising a Parser Agent to interpret user expressions and a Planner Agent to adjust policies dynamically using advanced techniques like simulation-augmented knowledge distillation.

Result: RecBot demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and business outcomes through extensive offline and online experiments.

Conclusion: Interactive recommendation using natural language enhances user control over the system, improves preference modeling, and addresses fundamental limitations of traditional systems.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the cognitive burden faced by archaeologists in navigating extensive collections of comparative data for artifact analysis.

Method: A dual-modal knowledge base is created from texts and images, allowing visual and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. The retrieved data is synthesized using a VLM to produce structured inferences and justifications about artifacts.

the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from

*Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines Cross-Entropy loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems, proposing a new method (RCE-KD) to improve rank distillation by addressing a key contradiction between theoretical assumptions and practical goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance KD for recommender systems by analyzing Cross-Entropy loss, identifying a gap between theoretical guarantees provided by the closure assumption and the practical task of distilling rankings from a teacher model.

Method: The authors derive theoretical connections between Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and NDCG metric, propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD) with a teacher-student collaboration sampling strategy, and adaptively combine the loss on teacher's split subsets.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed RCE-KD method effectively bridges the theoretical-practical gap, leading to improved performance in ranking distillation tasks for recommender systems.

Conclusion: RCE-KD addresses critical limitations in conventional KD by reconciling the theoretical requirements of the CE loss closure assumption with the practical objective of distilling teacher's rankings, proving its efficacy through extensive empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntSR, a generative framework for integrating search and recommendation (S&R) tasks using distinct query modalities, addressing computational and pattern learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search and recommendation tasks differ fundamentally based on how queries are formed and their purposes. Current systems lack an integrated approach for both tasks despite their different requirements.

Method: The proposed framework, IntSR, integrates search and recommendation tasks by handling distinct query modalities and addressing challenges like computational complexity and dynamic corpus-induced errors.

Result: IntSR demonstrated significant performance improvements in diverse real-world applications at Amap, including increases in GMV (3.02%), CTR (2.76%), and ACC (5.13%).

Conclusion: IntSR effectively integrates search and recommendation systems, showing significant practical performance improvements and addressing key challenges in computational efficiency and erroneous pattern learning.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: QAMO introduces a multi-centroid one-class learning approach for better deepfake detection by incorporating speech quality assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of a single-centroid representation in modeling bona fide speech for detecting deepfake attacks, and to leverage speech quality information for improved performance.

Method: The proposed QAMO uses multiple quality-aware centroids, each representing distinct speech quality subspaces, and incorporates a multi-centroid ensemble scoring strategy for enhanced inference.

Result: QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% on the In-the-Wild dataset, surpassing prior one-class and quality-aware systems.

Conclusion: Using multi-centroid models with speech quality awareness allows for better representation of bona fide speech variability, resulting in significant improvement in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality
labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality
speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

Method: The dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training framework, which compares and aligns gradient directions from original and augmented inputs to minimize optimization conflicts.

Result: The method reduced Equal Error Rate by up to 18.69% and accelerated convergence during training compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Gradient alignment significantly enhances the effectiveness of data augmentation in speech deepfake detection, leading to better generalization and faster training.

Abstract: In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

*Anupam Purwar,Aditya Choudhary*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice (V-2-V) communication models for real-time conversational applications, emphasizing processing time reductions and maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of reducing latency in voice-to-voice systems while maintaining high-quality interactions essential for real-time conversational applications.

Method: The paper analyzes key components like ASR, TTS, and dialog management, focusing on TTS optimization using Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations and codebook reduction for improving efficiency.

Result: The study identifies that optimizing RVQ iterations in the TTS component significantly impacts latency, though it may lead to lowered voice quality. TTS plays a central role in reducing the Real Time Factor (RTF).

Conclusion: Optimizations in RVQ iterations and the reduction of codebooks for TTS decoding are critical for enhancing the efficiency of V-2-V systems, especially those based on CSM architectures.

Abstract: We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication
model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing
components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech
recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work
analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality
interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work
identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions
including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time
factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the
capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting
both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate
speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)
iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality
of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for
V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought
by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

### [405] [SupCLAP: Controlling Optimization Trajectory Drift in Audio-Text Contrastive Learning with Support Vector Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21033)
*Jiehui Luo,Yuguo Yin,Yuxin Xie,Jinghan Ru,Xianwei Zhuang,Minghua He,Aofan Liu,Zihan Xiong,Dongchao Yang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes Support Vector Regularization (SVR) to stabilize training and enrich representations in contrastive language-audio pretraining by controlling the perpendicular force of negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in contrastive language-audio pretraining where the unconstrained perpendicular force from negative samples introduces both instability and trajectory drift during training.

Method: The proposed SVR introduces auxiliary support vectors to better control the perpendicular component from negative samples. It utilizes a semantic radius, with unsupervised modeling strategies including direct parameterization and adaptive radius predictors.

Result: Extensive experiments show SVR outperforms common methods like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss on classification, monolingual, and multilingual retrieval tasks on standard audio-text datasets.

Conclusion: The SVR method both theoretically and experimentally proves its efficacy in improving stability and performance in contrastive multimodal learning.

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal
representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

*Sitong Cheng,Weizhen Bian,Xinsheng Wang,Ruibin Yuan,Jianyi Chen,Shunshun Yin,Yike Guo,Wei Xue*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniSS, a single-stage framework for expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), overcoming challenges like data scarcity and translation capability transfer from large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in expressive S2ST, such as limited paired expressive speech data, complex multi-stage processes, and difficulty in transferring translation know-how from text-based LLMs.

Method: The authors propose UniSS, which integrates speech semantic and style modeling with an existing text-based LLM framework. It employs cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting to align audio semantics with text and ensure style preservation. They also developed a large expressive S2ST dataset called UniST.

Result: UniSS achieves better translation fidelity and speech quality than previous methods, while maintaining voice, emotional style, and duration consistency.

Conclusion: UniSS simplifies and improves the paradigm for expressive S2ST systems, and offers a state-of-the-art solution for translating expressive speech while preserving essential features.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

*Kai Zhang,Corey D Barrett,Jangwon Kim,Lichao Sun,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents proposes a multi-agent system to improve chest X-ray interpretations by introducing clinical reasoning and multimodal evidence fusion, along with methods to detect and resolve inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for chest X-ray interpretation lack clinical interpretability, multimodal evidence integration, and mechanisms to resolve inconsistencies.

Method: RadAgents integrates clinical priors with multimodal reasoning and employs grounding and retrieval-augmentation techniques to verify context inconsistencies.

Result: RadAgents enhances the reliability, transparency, and clinical consistency of chest X-ray interpretations.

Conclusion: The framework bridges existing gaps in clinical interpretability and multimodal reasoning for radiology tasks by introducing innovative tools and methods.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

### [408] [Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20412)
*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This work introduces ECHO-MIMIC, a framework that transforms complex collective action problems into simpler agent-level tasks by discovering heuristic policies and motivational messages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing ill-structured problems in collective actions, where aligning individual incentives with global goals is challenging due to unclear causal links and conflicts among stakeholders.

Method: The framework consists of two stages: ECHO evolves Python-based behavioral heuristics, and MIMIC develops persuasive natural language messages. Both use evolutionary search guided by large language models to propose diverse variations and select those optimizing group outcomes in a simulated context.

Result: The framework was tested on an agricultural landscape management situation. ECHO-MIMIC discovered effective heuristics and messages that aligned simulated farming choices with broader ecological objectives, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: ECHO-MIMIC simplifies tackling ill-structured problems by turning them into manageable agent-level tasks and offers a scalable solution for adaptive policy design.

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

*Shanjukta Nath,Jiwon Hong,Jae Ho Chang,Keith Warren,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper shows that AI-generated text embeddings from an LLM can accurately predict recidivism in correctional facility residents and introduces new methods to estimate peer effects in such language dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recidivism prediction by leveraging written communication within correctional facilities and to understand the social dynamics through advanced language embeddings.

Method: The authors used embeddings from a transformer-based LLM of written exchanges in correctional facilities, performed Zero-Shot classification for interpretation, and developed a new peer effect estimation methodology.

Result: Embedding vectors outperform pre-entry covariates by 30% in predicting recidivism, and the study finds significant peer effects in language usage within the facilities.

Conclusion: AI and advanced statistical methods can improve recidivism prediction and provide insights into the social interactions inside correctional facilities.

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

*Federico Nesti,Niko Salamini,Mauro Marinoni,Giorgio Maria Cicero,Gabriele Serra,Alessandro Biondi,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a software architecture aimed at enhancing the safety, security, and real-time predictability of autonomous systems that use neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks, though effective, are prone to various issues like anomalous inputs, adversarial attacks, and unreliable timing in rich operating systems, making them untrustworthy in safety-critical autonomous systems.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-domain architecture hosted on a shared platform. It utilizes a type-1 real-time hypervisor to isolate a neural-network domain from a safety-critical domain. A fail-safe mechanism switches control to a simpler, safer backup module during unsafe behavior.

Result: Experiments on a Furuta pendulum and a rover demonstrated that the fail-safe mechanism successfully prevents faults caused by the learning system.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enhances trustworthiness in learning-based autonomous systems by effectively handling neural network misbehavior through isolation and a fallback safety mechanism.

Abstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

*Samuel Lin,Jiawei Zhou,Minlan Yu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system using large language models (LLMs) to democratize network management, allowing non-experts to manage networks through natural language interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network management is traditionally restricted to experts, creating barriers for lay users. The motivation is to make network management accessible to a broader audience using advancements in LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces an agentic framework leveraging LLMs, including an intermediate representation, real-time network state memory retrieval, and a pilot study-supported visualization interface for effective network control.

Result: Pilot studies and preliminary experiments validate the system's effectiveness in handling natural language utterances for network control, demonstrating promising results.

Conclusion: The system significantly facilitates network management for non-experts, democratizing network control and encouraging further development in leveraging LLMs for broader applications.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a trustworthy architecture for semantic communication in vehicular networks to address critical trust issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome trust challenges in semantic communication for vehicular networks, such as eavesdropping, encoder-decoder poisoning, and untrustworthy communication entities.

Method: The paper introduces: 1) a semantic camouflage mechanism for anti-eavesdropping, 2) a federated training framework addressing attacks on encoder-decoder systems, 3) an audit game-based method for ensuring vehicle trustworthiness.

Result: The case study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed three-layer architecture in addressing trust issues in vehicular networks.

Conclusion: The study advances trustworthy semantic communication in vehicular networks and suggests further research directions to enhance its implementation.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce
communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within
vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks
(VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission,
semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an
innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we
introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive
adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated
encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are
pointed out to advance this emerging field.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper presents a semantic communication framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) and multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable efficient real-time urban traffic monitoring by significantly reducing data transmission requirements while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for real-time traffic monitoring in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to enhance road safety and optimize traffic flow in smart cities. Existing methods face challenges with bandwidth limitations and computing power, especially when deploying LLMs on edge devices.

Method: The proposed method detects Regions of Interest (RoIs) in traffic scenes using YOLOv11 and converts these image segments into compact embedding vectors via a Vision Transformer (ViT). These smaller-sized embeddings are transmitted to the cloud, where the images are reconstructed and analyzed with multimodal LLMs to generate traffic descriptions.

Result: The framework achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% from reconstructed images, compared to 93% accuracy when using original cropped images.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud solutions to overcome bandwidth limitations, providing an efficient and practical approach for real-time traffic surveillance in urban smart city systems.

Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

Motivation: To address growing demands for scalable, effective workforce preparation in data science amid constraints of traditional instruction.

Method: Developed VITA, integrating LLM-powered chatbot, formative assessments, an end-to-end data pipeline for analytics, and adaptive learning pathways.

Result: Achieved a conceptual benchmark against other tutoring architectures, created reusable tools for adaptive learning, and outlined trade-offs in deployment models.

Conclusion: Conversational AI can enhance learning engagement, feedback, and personalization at scale. Future improvements address adaptive intelligence and wider applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive

(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized

TL;DR: The paper examines how large language models use strategic deception and why existing interpretability methods struggle to detect it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate deceptive behaviors in language models when such actions might help them achieve goals.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using two testbeds: 'Secret Agenda' for inducing lying across 38 models, and insider trading compliance tasks examining responses via SAE architectures.

Result: Autolabel-driven interpretability methods failed to detect or prevent deception, whereas aggregate unlabeled activations provided more meaningful insights into deceptive and compliant behavior.

Conclusion: Current interpretability methods (autolabels) are limited in addressing deception in language models, but population-level unlabeled activations show potential for improved risk assessment techniques.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

Result: The HASC enables clear communication of security flaws and empowers developers and stakeholders to make better-informed decisions throughout an AI system's lifecycle.

Conclusion: The framework complements standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and promotes enhanced safety, accountability, and transparency in developing and deploying AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and

card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent

### [419] [Data-Efficient ASR Personalization for Non-Normative Speech Using an Uncertainty-Based Phoneme Difficulty Score for Guided Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20396)
*Niclas Pokel,Pehuén Moure,Roman Boehringer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for improving ASR systems for individuals with speech impairments by using uncertainty-guided fine-tuning, validated on English and German datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges ASR systems face with non-normative speech caused by impairments, involving high variability and insufficient training data.

Method: The method uses Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate phoneme-level uncertainty, guiding a targeted oversampling strategy for fine-tuning the ASR model.

Result: Validated on English and German datasets, the method aligns model uncertainty with expert clinical assessments and significantly improves ASR accuracy.

Conclusion: This work offers a data-efficient framework for personalized and inclusive ASR, bridging model predictions with clinical expertise to enhance speech recognition for individuals with speech impairments.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech
from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or
structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training
data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient
personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide
fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model
finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling
strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we
demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with
phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report,
marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model
uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that
this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves
ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive
ASR.

### [420] [Variational Low-Rank Adaptation for Personalized Impaired Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20397)
*Niclas Pokel,Pehuén Moure,Roman Boehringer,Shih-Chii Liu,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of impaired speech recognition in ASR systems by proposing a data-efficient personalization method, validated on English and German datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems struggle with impaired speech recognition due to limited data and high acoustic variability.

Method: The authors introduce Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for efficiently fine-tuning ASR systems in low-resource settings.

Result: The method shows significant accuracy improvements for impaired speech recognition on English UA-Speech and German BF-Sprache datasets.

Conclusion: Improved ASR performance underlines the method's practicality for more inclusive systems, especially for individuals with speech impairments.

Abstract: Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral
palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due
to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements,
state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative
speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability.
Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome:
speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation
often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a
novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for
data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech
dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child
with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to
reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with
speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired
speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical
path toward inclusive ASR.

### [421] [Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20485)
*Ismail Rasim Ulgen,Zongyang Du,Junchen Lu,Philipp Koehn,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces TTScore, a novel evaluation framework that offers targeted, reliable assessment of intelligibility and prosody in synthesized speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating synthesized speech, such as WER and F0-RMSE, have limitations and do not correlate well with human perception.

Method: The authors propose TTScore, consisting of two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int for intelligibility and TTScore-pro for prosody, using likelihood computation over discrete speech tokens.

Result: Experimental results on SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks show that TTScore significantly correlates better with human evaluations of speech quality compared to traditional metrics.

Conclusion: TTScore represents a promising improvement in automated speech synthesis evaluation, offering interpretable and reference-free metrics for intelligibility and prosody.

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech
generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain
limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate
(WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while
F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent
view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted
and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of
discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors
conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through
content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody
tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood
of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that
capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure.
Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that
TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and
achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than
existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

*T. Aleksandra Ma,Sile Yin,Li-Chia Yang,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: RAVEN is a CPU-based real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system leveraging lip movements to enhance speech clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a real-time, CPU-based audio-visual speech enhancement system that handles complex auditory scenarios, leveraging lip movement data.

Method: The system utilizes pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to integrate lip movement cues into the speech enhancement process.

Result: RAVEN works effectively in diverse conditions, including environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and singing voices.

Conclusion: RAVEN offers an innovative live demonstration of audio-visual speech enhancement on standard hardware, showcasing its versatility and practicality.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech
enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel,
audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task
of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has
explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness,
particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our
knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time
audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap
by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition
model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across
environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing
voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live
audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup,
with clean speech playback through headphones.

### [423] [Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21087)
*Rostislav Makarov,Lea Schönherr,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerability of advanced speech enhancement models to adversarial attacks and highlights the robustness of diffusion models under such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing expressiveness in speech enhancement models has led to sophisticated improvements, but this increased capability also introduces potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors crafted psychoacoustically masked adversarial noise to manipulate speech enhancement models, experimenting on contemporary predictive models to demonstrate susceptibility.

Result: Findings confirm that advanced speech models can be adversarially manipulated, and diffusion models with stochastic samplers display robustness to such attacks.

Conclusion: The study shows a critical vulnerability in predictive speech enhancement systems and points towards diffusion models as a resilient alternative against adversarial noise.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly
expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability:
advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and
psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the
enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We
experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models
can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion
models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial
attacks by design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a higher-order reverse chain rule called the reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno’s Formula within Cartesian reverse differential categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to expand the theory of reverse differentiation by establishing a higher-order reverse chain rule in the context of Cartesian reverse differential categories.

Method: The authors build upon the foundational axioms of Cartesian reverse differential categories and define partial and higher-order reverse derivatives to derive the reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula.

Result: Higher-order reverse differentiation is formalized, giving rise to the reverse Faa di Bruno Formula and enriching the categorical framework for reverse differentiation.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of reverse differentiation by introducing tools and formulas for higher-order operations in Cartesian reverse differential categories.

Abstract: Reverse differentiation is an essential operation for automatic
differentiation. Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse
differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is
the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse
derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue
of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a
Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define
partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian
reverse differential category.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SGAligner++, a language-assisted framework for improving alignment of 3D scene graphs across heterogeneous modalities, especially under noisy and low-overlap conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with aligning incomplete or noisy scene graph observations, particularly when using single-modality point cloud data.

Method: SGAligner++ combines lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion mechanisms to learn a unified joint embedding space for effective cross-modal alignment.

Result: Experiments show that SGAligner++ outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 40% on noisy real-world 3D scene graph reconstructions, proving its robustness and cross-modal adaptability.

Conclusion: SGAligner++ advances 3D scene graph alignment by enhancing robustness, scalability, and computational efficiency, making it suited for localization, reconstruction, and navigation tasks.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

*Yandan Yang,Baoxiong Jia,Shujie Zhang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SceneWeaver is a novel framework that synthesizes realistic 3D indoor scenes using iterative refinement via a language model-based planner and tool selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for indoor scene synthesis are limited by fixed scene categories, insufficient object-level detail, and difficulty following complex user instructions, creating a need for a versatile, general-purpose solution.

Method: SceneWeaver integrates language model-based planning and a suite of extensible scene-generation tools to iteratively refine scenes based on physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SceneWeaver's superior performance across physical, visual, and semantic metrics, as well as its ability to generalize to diverse and complex scene instructions.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver represents a significant advancement in 3D environment synthesis, achieving both general-purpose applicability and high-quality scene generation.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

### [427] [ArtUV: Artist-style UV Unwrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20710)
*Yuguang Chen,Xinhai Liu,Yang Li,Victor Cheung,Zhuo Chen,Dongyu Zhang,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArtUV, an automated method for artist-style UV unwrapping, addressing limitations in existing techniques like fragmentation and lack of semanticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods are hindered by issues such as inefficiency, fragmentation, and lack of semantic coherence, which restrict their practical use in rendering pipelines.

Method: ArtUV employs a two-stage process: SeamGPT predicts semantically meaningful surface seams, followed by an Auto-Encoder refining rough UV mapping into artist-style UV maps.

Result: ArtUV demonstrates semantic consistency, preserves topology, and is suitable for 2D editing. Evaluations confirm its versatility as a plug-in or standalone tool for high-quality UV generation.

Conclusion: ArtUV offers an efficient, fully automated solution for generating artist-style UV maps, enhancing rendering workflows while ensuring quality and semantic precision.

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SeamCrafter is a GPT-style AI model designed for generating high-quality UV seams on 3D surfaces with reduced distortion and fragmentation, improving texture mapping and artist workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome prevalent issues of UV distortion and excessive fragmentation caused by poorly generated mesh seams, which negatively impact texture synthesis and artist workflows.

Method: The paper proposes SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator with a dual-branch point-cloud encoder for topological and geometric representation, along with fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a novel seam-evaluation framework.

Result: SeamCrafter outperforms prior methods by generating seams with lower distortion and fragmentation while maintaining topological consistency and visual fidelity in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter introduces a significant improvement in seam generation for UV parameterization, offering a balanced solution to distortion and fragmentation issues while supporting artist-friendly workflows.

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

*Jiabao Lei,Kewei Shi,Zhihao Liang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for generating 3D meshes progressively using a transformer-based auto-regressive (AR) model, offering superior control and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-regressive mesh generation models construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which is inconsistent with human perception of geometry. The paper aims to improve the representation by adopting a coarse-to-fine generation process.

Method: The paper employs mesh simplification algorithms for a coarse-to-fine approach and utilizes a transformer-based AR model to gradually add geometric details to a mesh. The process begins with a single point and iteratively refines through local remeshing.

Result: Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing intuitive control over mesh quality and generation time, as well as supporting applications like mesh refinement and editing.

Conclusion: Progressive mesh generation is a viable method offering improved geometric representation, control over generation processes, and potential for practical applications like refinement and customization.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of VR/MR/AR systems that rely heavily on hard-coded, task-specific interactions, which are not scalable for diverse architectural exploration.

Method: The authors propose ArchGPT, a model trained on Arch-300K, a dataset built with a multi-stage process including 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation, and LLM-guided metadata verification to ensure high-quality, architecture-specific VQA annotations.

Result: ArchGPT was fine-tuned on the Arch-300K dataset using the ShareGPT4V-7B multimodal backbone, providing a scalable and domain-specialized tool for architectural exploration.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable solution to leverage VR/MR/AR technologies in architecture through a robust dataset and an AI model capable of answering visual questions related to architecture.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach for direct and analytical surface extraction from neural implicit functions, avoiding traditional spatial discretization methods, leading to high accuracy in 3D geometry representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional surface extraction methods, like the Marching Cubes algorithm, which suffer from spatial discretization inaccuracies in 3D visual computing.

Method: The paper introduces an analytical surface extraction method that leverages depth-first traversal and the partitioning properties of neurons within a network to directly extract surface information from neural implicit functions.

Result: The proposed method generates highly accurate meshes that capture the entire geometric details of neural networks, proving its capability on various shapes and architectures, while maintaining speed and efficiency.

Conclusion: This analytical approach eliminates the need for ad-hoc spatial discretization, providing a robust, accurate, and efficient tool for surface geometry extraction in 3D visual computing.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CHARM is a novel framework and parametric representation designed for efficiently modeling stylized anime hairstyles either from input images or point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anime hairstyles are highly stylized and pose challenges for traditional realistic modeling techniques, requiring a new approach efficient for editing and learning-based generation.

Method: CHARM uses a compact control-point-based parameterization for hair cards and an autoregressive transformer to interpret and generate hairstyle designs as "hair language."

Result: CHARM achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and generation quality based on extensive experiments and evaluations using the large AnimeHair dataset.

Conclusion: CHARM provides a scalable, artist-friendly, and learning-based framework for generating high-fidelity anime hairstyles, enhancing both design efficiency and creative possibilities.

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based method to calibrate Windkessel parameters in blood flow models, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving calibration of Windkessel parameters for blood flow models, especially under challenging scenarios such as unknown measurement locations or noisy data.

Method: Designing a neural network trained on simulated blood pressures, capable of emulating pulse waves efficiently, and using dummy neurons for parameter recalibration.

Result: The neural network produces accurate pulse wave estimations and enables effective calibration even in scenarios with noise or uncertain measurement locations.

Conclusion: The novel neural network method proves effective for calibrating blood flow model parameters, addressing practical challenges like measurement uncertainty and noise.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK)
parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this
end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood
pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the
pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space
and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To
calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by
dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is
to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly,
when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by
noise.

*Shunyuan Mao,Weiqi Wang,Sifan Wang,Ruobing Dong,Lu Lu,Kwang Moo Yi,Paris Perdikaris,Andrea Isella,Sébastien Fabbro,Lile Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This paper employs Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the 2D, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks, reproducing key physical phenomena without requiring data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and computational expense of traditional simulations for accretion disks motivate the exploration of alternative methods for modeling their dynamics.

Method: The paper applies Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the hydrodynamic equations of accretion disks directly from physical laws, bypassing the need for numerical simulations and data.

Result: PINNs achieved accurate modeling of accretion disks, capturing phenomena such as spiral density waves and disk-companion interactions, while also avoiding issues like wave reflections in simulations.

Conclusion: PINNs demonstrate potential as a data-free, physics-driven alternative for modeling complex astrophysical systems, offering advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.

### [435] [Extrapolating Phase-Field Simulations in Space and Time with Purely Convolutional Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20770)
*Christophe Bonneville,Nathan Bieberdorf,Pieterjan Robbe,Mark Asta,Habib N. Najm,Laurent Capolungo,Cosmin Safta*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient U-Net-based surrogate for LMD phase-field models, capable of rapid predictions and accurate extrapolation beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LMD phase-field models are computationally expensive, limiting their use for large domains and long time horizons.

Method: The authors utilized a fully convolutional U-Net with convolutional self-attention, physics-aware padding, and parameter conditioning to ensure extrapolation abilities and adaptability to different alloy systems.

Result: The surrogate reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16,000 while achieving prediction errors of less than 5% in training conditions and under 10% during extrapolation.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation for phase-field models, significantly accelerating computations and opening avenues for broader LMD simulations.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

TL;DR: This paper explores the combinatorial structures of maxout polytopes defined by specific neural networks and delves into their parameter spaces, f-vectors, and hypersurfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometrical and combinatorial properties of maxout activation neural networks and their implications for network design and functionality.

Method: Analyzing parameter spaces, f-vectors, and separating hypersurfaces of shallow and generic networks using mathematical and computational tools.

Result: It was revealed that 1) maxout polytopes have specific properties like cubical structures in generic settings, and 2) additional layers impact separating hypersurfaces.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical design by showing how maxout polytopes behave under various network architectures.

Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout
activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We
characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes
for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise
when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are
cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

### [437] [Incorporating External Controls for Estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated with High-Dimensional Data: Retaining Double Robustness and Ensuring Double Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20586)
*Chi-Shian Dai,Chao Ying,Yang Ning,Jiwei Zhao*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel doubly robust estimator for ATT that effectively incorporates external controls without loss of efficiency, addressing shortcomings in earlier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External control data, while abundant and useful, are traditionally inefficient in standard ATT estimators, motivating the need for a new method to improve efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a doubly robust estimator that is more efficient and semiparametrically optimal, even when models are misspecified, and supports high-dimensional confounder settings.

Result: The proposed method guarantees higher estimation efficiency compared to traditional approaches, validated through simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The novel estimator improves causal inference robustness and efficiency when leveraging external control data, addressing challenges in RCTs and high-dimensional biomedical contexts.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard
for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation
procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the
control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address
scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size,
are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records
or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls
into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in
reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls.
This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external
controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue,
we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency
than the standard approach without external controls, even under model
misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator
aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external
controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory
developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which
are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive
simulation studies and a real-world data application.

*Sangwook Lee,Adnan Abbas,Yan Chen,Young-Ho Kim,Sang Won Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot, to enhance organizational memory in university research labs through functions like Q&A and document updates. It was tested in research labs, revealing privacy-awareness tensions and challenges in documentation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research labs face difficulties preserving and navigating valuable knowledge shared on chat-based platforms, leading to organizational memory challenges.

Method: The authors conducted formative interviews to identify organizational memory issues and designed the CHOIR chatbot. They deployed CHOIR in four labs over a month, analyzing usage data from 21 participants.

Result: During deployment, 107 questions were asked, and 38 document updates were made, highlighting issues such as privacy-awareness tensions and students' hesitancy to contribute.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into privacy-preserving design and supporting context-specific documentation, addressing persistent organizational memory challenges in research labs.

Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication
and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in
message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing
maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews
that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an
LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key
functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion,
knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We
deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab
members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the
organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension:
questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into
documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in
generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute
design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting
context-specific knowledge documentation.

*Yiren Liu,Viraj Shah,Sangho Suh,Pao Siangliulue,Tal August,Yun Huang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perspectra, a forum-style interface to guide deliberation among multi-agent systems, showing its effectiveness in enhancing critical thinking and proposal development compared to traditional chat systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how users can effectively control, steer, and evaluate collaborations among multiple domain-specific agents in multi-agent systems.

Method: The study developed the Perspectra tool with interactive features like @-mentioning, threading, and real-time mind maps, and compared it to a group-chat baseline in a within-subject study with 18 participants creating research proposals.

Result: Perspectra led to increased critical-thinking behaviors, more interdisciplinary replies, and more revisions of research proposals compared to the group-chat approach.

Conclusion: Perspectra effectively supports critical thinking and adversarial discourse in multi-agent systems, providing insights into designing tools to enhance user collaboration with such systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

*Faraz Faruqi,Amira Abdel-Rahman,Leandra Tejedor,Martin Nisser,Jiaji Li,Vrushank Phadnis,Varun Jampani,Neil Gershenfeld,Megan Hofmann,Stefanie Mueller*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces MechStyle, a system for stylizing 3D printable models using Generative AI while ensuring structural integrity using Finite Element Analysis feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of preserving structural integrity in 3D printable models, as Generative AI-based stylization processes often lead to significant geometric changes that compromise model durability.

Method: MechStyle integrates Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation into the AI-driven stylization process to limit geometric changes in high-stress regions. It evaluates three stylization control strategies and adaptive scheduling strategies for performance.

Result: The study demonstrates how incorporating FEA feedback into stylization improves the structural viability of 3D models, enhances user control, and offers practical applications through a specialized user interface.

Conclusion: MechStyle successfully combines Generative AI and FEA to create stylized 3D models that are structurally sound, offering new possibilities for creators in fabrication-oriented designs.

Abstract: Recent developments in Generative AI enable creators to stylize 3D models
based on text prompts. These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can
compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present
MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while
preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by
augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies
the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation
reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the
effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process
by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time
efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies.
Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to
generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example
applications.

### [441] [Understanding Mode Switching in Human-AI Collaboration: Behavioral Insights and Predictive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20666)
*Avinash Ajit Nargund,Arthur Caetano,Kevin Yang,Rose Yiwei Liu,Philip Tezaur,Kriteen Shrestha,Qisen Pan,Tobias Höllerer,Misha Sra*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores dynamic user switches between control levels in Human-AI collaboration during decision-making tasks using chess as a case study, collecting behavioral and emotional data to build a prediction model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to better understand how users dynamically switch between AI guidance and delegation during tasks, addressing overlooked changes in user preferences influenced by trust, complexity, and control perception.

Method: Using a hand-and-brain chess experiment, participants alternated between two modes of collaboration with AI, with data gathered on gaze, emotional states, decision difficulty, and behavioral indicators.

Result: Statistical analysis revealed patterns in gaze and task complexity before control switches and move quality after switching. A predictive model was developed with $F1 = 0.65$ using engineered features.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into dynamic Human-AI control switching, proposing behavioral signal-based predictive mechanisms that could improve shared autonomy systems.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control
levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the
final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within
user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic
surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within
a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and
perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch
between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making
task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece
and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and
the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400
mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional
state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in
the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered
behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that
predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests
that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside
system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our
quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching
including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control,
identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and
modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that
need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and
evolving task demands.

TL;DR: This paper investigates designers' perspectives on integrating agentic AI into their workflows through a design fiction study, highlighting authority distribution and collaboration aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how designers feel about collaborating with agentic AI systems that perform mundane tasks, aiming to enhance creativity and workflow efficiency.

Method: The study used design fiction involving ten professional designers who discussed and imagined working with an agentic AI platform to organize inspiration and ideate.

Result: The findings identified roles for AI agents in supporting designers, mechanisms for authority sharing, and methods to explain designers' intent to AI systems.

Conclusion: A conceptual framework was developed to understand authority distribution between humans and AI, with recommendations for future design workflows utilizing agentic AI.

Abstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging:
Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic
AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing
designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel
about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design
fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative
agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed
collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our
findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the
division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be
explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a
conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI
agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design
workflows.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines AI-driven VTubers, focusing on viewer perceptions of the popular Neuro-sama, through analysis of social media comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits and challenges of AI-driven VTubers, particularly in contrast to human-operated VTubers, amid questions of authenticity and engagement.

Method: Conducted a case study analyzing 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments about Neuro-sama, the AI-driven VTuber.

Result: Findings reveal insights into viewer motivations, AI persona construction, and perceptions of AI as a substitute for the human operator.

Conclusion: AI-driven VTubers provide continuous operation and reduced personal risks, but authenticity and audience engagement remain complex challenges in digital streaming culture.

Abstract: VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained
massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human
controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses
risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The
emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human
constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous
operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about
authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we
conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most
popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on
YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to
better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona,
and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding
of AI-driven VTubers and their impact on digital streaming culture.

*Kolawole Tytler*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces iatroX, a clinical reference platform for UK clinicians using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models, and reports on its early adoption, usability, and clinical value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper was to address the growing issue of information overload faced by clinicians, which hinders evidence-based care, and to evaluate the potential of a RAG-based platform to provide reliable, linked clinical information quickly.

Method: The evaluation involved retrospective usage analysis of iatroX across various platforms over 16 weeks, along with an intercept survey assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent using randomized prompts and thematic content analysis of free-text feedback.

Result: The platform reached over 19,000 web users and approximately 40,000 clinical queries. Survey responses showed high perceived usefulness (86.2%), intent to reuse (93.3%), recommendation likelihood (88.4%), perceived accuracy (75%), and reliability (79.4%).

Conclusion: iatroX shows promise in mitigating clinicians' information overload, offering timely, guideline-linked, and UK-specific answers. However, limitations include early-adopter bias and sample size constraints, with future work focusing on accuracy audits and workflow impact studies.

Abstract: Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and
guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but
requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based
clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and
perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods
comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over
16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage
metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side
script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a
predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.
Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text
comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web
users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile
uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active
users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness
86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%;
14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived
accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI
62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK
specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information
overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include
small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include
accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.

TL;DR: This study analyzes how credibility is presented in nutrition and supplement videos on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, focusing on authority signals, narrative strategies, and monetization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-form video platforms mix helpful and harmful content in health advice, and this paper aims to explore how credibility is constructed in these videos instead of determining their truthfulness.

Method: The study assembles and annotates a corpus of 152 videos, examining 26 features related to presenter attributes, visual authority, narrative techniques, and engagement. The process integrates speech recognition, multimodal models, and human validation for a transparent analysis.

Result: The analysis reveals frequent use of authority cues (titles, charts, credentials) alongside persuasive narratives (jargon, fear, critiques of mainstream medicine) and monetization strategies (sales links, subscribing calls). Credibility is often intertwined with emotive and oppositional narratives.

Conclusion: Nutrition-related short-form videos emphasize persuasive and visual authority cues, blending them with monetization efforts and emotive storytelling, which can impact how audiences perceive credibility.

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

*Fanchen Bu,Geon Lee,Minyoung Choe,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper studies the concept of 'group anchors,' significant individuals within group interactions, and proposes 'AnchorRadar,' a semi-supervised method to identify them with high accuracy and efficiency in label-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that certain individuals play a pivotal role in the formation of group activities, e.g., first authors in papers or senders in emails, and identifying such individuals is important but challenging when labels are scarce.

Method: The authors developed 'AnchorRadar,' a semi-supervised method leveraging both labeled and unlabeled group data to identify group anchors efficiently and accurately.

Result: AnchorRadar outperformed various baseline methods in terms of accuracy, training time, and resource efficiency across experiments on thirteen real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorRadar is an effective and computationally efficient method for identifying group anchors in real-world interactions, even with limited labeled data, demonstrating its practicality and edge over existing methods.

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship,
email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a
particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples
include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the
questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such
individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group
anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the
concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our
observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our
observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group
anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when
only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method
using information from groups both with and without known group anchors.
Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines
w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher
accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using
10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$
fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning approach to address community membership hiding (CMH) for preserving privacy in social graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent sensitive information from being inferred in social graphs while minimally altering graph topology, particularly in scenarios involving overlapping communities.

Method: The paper employs deep reinforcement learning to devise effective edge modification strategies that enable target nodes to leave their original communities.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing baselines in experiments on real-world datasets, excelling in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: This work offers a sophisticated approach to privacy preservation in social graphs with overlapping communities, advancing beyond the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive
information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph
analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this
through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks
edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community,
regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on
non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice,
but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such
strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize
and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including
the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for
privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning methods for super-resolving turbulent flows and examines how turbulence itself can indirectly provide rotational symmetry to standard CNNs without explicit augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating turbulence is computationally expensive, and there is a need for machine learning methods that efficiently super-resolve turbulent flows while respecting physical symmetries.

Method: The authors trained standard CNNs on 3D channel-flow subdomains of varying anisotropy, analyzing the influence of spatial and temporal sampling to assess rotational equivariance errors.

Result: Models trained with data from isotropic mid-plane subdomains exhibited lower equivariance errors compared to those from anisotropic boundary layers. Increased temporal and spatial sampling further reduced these errors.

Conclusion: Rotational symmetry can be acquired directly from turbulent data under certain conditions, making explicit symmetry incorporation unnecessary in specific cases while enabling efficient and symmetry-aware super-resolution.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use
of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central
challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as
rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or
specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational
augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with
differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane
data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer
data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error.
We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs
regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local
isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be
explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained
directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware
super-resolution.

### [449] [Incorporating LLM Embeddings for Variation Across the Human Genome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20702)
*Hongqian Niu,Jordan Bryan,Xihao Li,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework to generate genomic variant embeddings using large language models, enabling their systematic application to genome-wide data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of large language models being applied predominantly to gene-level biological information and expand their utility to variant-level genomic data.

Method: Semantic text descriptions were curated for billions of genetic variants from multiple datasets (FAVOR, ClinVar, GWAS) and embeddings were generated using OpenAI's and Qwen's LLMs for varying scales of genomic data.

Result: The variant embeddings demonstrated high predictive accuracy for genomic properties through baseline experiments, validating their structured representation of genetic variation.

Conclusion: This framework provides publicly accessible embeddings that can advance genomic discovery and precision medicine through improved hypothesis testing and genetic risk prediction methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled
powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date
focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic
frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome.
Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we
constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and
generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90
million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants.
Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the
open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high
predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as
structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream
applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the
Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and
embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic
risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a
foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces using physics-informed neural networks to enhance the efficiency of variational quantum algorithms, significantly reducing quantum resource costs and computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational quantum algorithms suffer from resource inefficiency due to the no-cloning theorem, which obstructs standard backpropagation for large-scale applications.

Method: The authors model the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear PDE, leveraging physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict parameter updates on the classical side using limited quantum device data.

Result: Their method achieved up to a 30x speedup and a 90% reduction in quantum resource costs while maintaining competitive accuracy in numerical experiments with up to 40 qubits.

Conclusion: The presented approach enhances the scalability and efficiency of VQAs, complementing existing techniques and boosting their potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach
practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning
theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to
prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To
address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a
nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that
leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical
system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected
from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over
multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum
resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and
reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40
qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques
aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their
potential for practical applications.

*Alessandro Bombini,Alessandro Rosa,Clarissa Buti,Giovanni Passaleva,Lucio Anderlini*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in developing tracking detectors for future high-luminosity hadron colliders, focusing on 3D diamond pixel sensors. It models signal delay caused by high-resistivity electrodes using advanced mathematical methods and computational simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders require detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, precise spatial resolution, and ultra-fast timing capabilities. The authors aim to overcome limitations in signal propagation due to high-resistivity electrodes in 3D diamond pixel sensors.

Method: The authors extend classical weighting potential theory and develop a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE model as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. This model is numerically solved and integrated with charge transport simulations. They leverage Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Networks trained on Spectral Method data for meshless solving.

Result: The study successfully creates a nuanced model and computational approach to evaluate the timing degradation caused by electrode resistance in 3D diamond pixel sensors.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust computational methodology for analyzing and resolving signal propagation issues in 3D diamond pixel sensors, paving the way for improved detector designs in high-radiation environments.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with
extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing.
3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation
hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via
femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal
propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley
weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order,
3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations.
The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for
realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural
Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess
timing degradation from electrode resistance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces concept-based in-context learning (CB-ICL), provides theoretical insights into its effectiveness, and validates these through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of in-context learning (ICL), despite its importance in natural language processing and large language model applications.

Method: The study develops theoretical analyses of concept-based ICL (CB-ICL), quantifying knowledge transfer and proposing a similarity measure between prompt demonstrations and query inputs. It also explores the effects of prompt size and embedding dimensions.

Result: The research demonstrates when and why CB-ICL is effective for label prediction tasks with few demonstrations and validates these insights using real-data experiments.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for improving model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

### [454] [Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20848)
*Hadley Black,Kasper Green Larsen,Arya Mazumdar,Barna Saha,Geelon So*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficient halfspace learning without point synthesis, achieving tight $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$ bounds by exploiting structure in orderings for parallel binary search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently learning the labels of points using an unknown halfspace is traditionally achieved with query access to external points (point synthesis). Without this, existing algorithms face an $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound. The paper aims to bypass this by restricting the normal vectors of halfspaces to a finite set.

Method: The authors leverage a binary search performed in parallel rather than sequentially by exploiting structured orderings for the problem. This is particularly applied to halfspaces with normal vectors from a set of size $D$ and extended to monotone Boolean functions.

Result: The algorithm achieves optimal $O(D + \\log n)$ queries for the problem, including deterministic learning of axis-aligned halfspaces. It also provides nearly optimal PAC-learning bounds, robust to certain adversarial corruptions.

Conclusion: The study closes prior gaps in query complexity, adds new insights into structured problem-solving methods, and achieves optimal or near-optimal performance in both deterministic and PAC-learning scenarios.

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace
$f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every
point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal
$\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to
Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted
the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in
fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to
Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning
halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound,
we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size
$D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain
an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned
halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$.
In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean
function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$
provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these
orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each
ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal
algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon),
1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error
$\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a
$c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This
bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) responds to memory faults and assesses fault mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about the fault tolerance of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) systems, which are increasingly deployed but have largely ignored reliability issues.

Method: The paper evaluates FHE schemes and their behavior under memory faults at both operational and application levels, and assesses traditional and FHE-specific fault mitigation techniques.

Result: Provides insights into the fault tolerance of various FHE schemes and the effectiveness of different fault mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for robust fault mitigation in FHE systems to improve their reliability in privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

*Jiayi Lin,Liangcai Su,Junzhe Li,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: R1-Fuzz is a framework enhancing textual input generation for fuzzing complex software systems by using reinforcement learning to optimize small language models, achieving remarkable outcomes like higher coverage rates and new vulnerability discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzing struggles with complex software targets requiring intricate syntactic and semantic inputs, while leveraging the potential of language models has been limited by insufficient exploration and high costs.

Method: R1-Fuzz specializes small, cost-efficient language models using RL-based post-training with designed datasets, employing coverage-slicing for question construction and distance-based reward calculations.

Result: R1-Fuzz-7B, a small model, rivals and outperforms larger models in fuzzing, achieving up to 75% higher coverage and identifying 29 previously unknown vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz demonstrates that reinforcement learning can effectively optimize small models for robust fuzzing performance, offering a practical and efficient alternative to larger models.

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing security and performance balancing in satellite constellations while understanding which AI architecture is most effective.

Method: The authors compare three AI architectures—centralized, distributed, and federated—for managing satellite constellation security, with emphasis on their advantages and limitations.

Result: Centralized architecture emerged as the fastest and most effective short-term solution despite communication latency, while decentralized approaches offer better scalability and security in the long term.

Conclusion: For immediate satellite security needs, centralized architectures are recommended, but decentralized architectures are more suitable for long-term performance and scalability. Federated options may play supportive roles.

Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off between centralized and decentralized
security management in constellations of satellites to balance security and
performance. We highlight three key AI architectures for automated security
management: (a) centralized, (b) distributed and (c) federated. The centralized
architecture is the best option short term, providing fast training, despite
the hard challenge of the communication latency overhead across space.
Decentralized architectures are better alternatives in the longer term,
providing enhanced scalability and security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AutoMalTool introduces an automated approach to evaluate vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents by generating malicious model context protocol (MCP) tools, exposing potential security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of LLMs with MCP tools for various applications has raised concerns about potential vulnerabilities, particularly tool poisoning attacks, which need systematic examination.

Method: The authors developed AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework that generates malicious MCP tools to manipulate LLM-based agents, systematically exposing vulnerabilities.

Result: AutoMalTool successfully creates malicious MCP tools that exploit vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents while avoiding detection by current security measures, unveiling significant risks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for enhanced security measures in MCP tool integration, as AutoMalTool demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting these vulnerabilities effectively.

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Motivation: To address the challenges of real-time processing, privacy issues, and spoofing vulnerabilities in deploying ECG biometrics for wearable devices.

Method: A MobileNetV1+GRU architecture for ECG authentication is proposed, with 20dB Gaussian noise injection, custom preprocessing, and testing on multiple datasets simulating wearable and edge deployment conditions.

Result: The model achieved high accuracies (up to 99.34%), F1-scores, ROC-AUC values, and low EER across various datasets but showed significant vulnerability (accuracy dropped to 0.80%) under FGSM adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Advancing ECG-based biometrics requires better adversarial robustness testing, federated learning, and access to diverse wearable physiological datasets for secure and scalable implementations.

Abstract: ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their

*Wei Wan,Yuxuan Ning,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Shengshan Hu,Ziqi Zhou,Yechao Zhang,Tianqing Zhu,Wanlei Zhou,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced defense mechanism, MARS, for mitigating backdoor attacks in Federated Learning by leveraging backdoor energy and effective clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses in Federated Learning are ineffective against sophisticated backdoor attacks like 3DFed due to reliance on loosely aligned statistical measures.

Method: MARS identifies backdoor models by calculating backdoor energy (BE) for neurons, using concentrated backdoor energy (CBE) amplification, and performing Wasserstein distance-based clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS successfully defends against state-of-the-art backdoor attacks like 3DFed, outperforming current approaches.

Conclusion: MARS presents a robust defense by integrating backdoor energy assessment and advanced clustering techniques, addressing the core weakness of existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

*Amir AL-Maamari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates privacy issues in AI coding assistants using a novel scorecard, highlighting risks and industry weaknesses to aid in evidence-based tool selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy and trust concerns stemming from developers using AI coding tools with unclear data handling practices.

Method: A privacy scorecard was designed and validated by experts, analyzing legal policies, audits, and other documents across 14 criteria to rank five AI coding assistants.

Result: The research found a significant privacy disparity (20-point gap) between the highest- and lowest-ranked tools, revealing critical privacy weaknesses like opt-out consent for training models and ineffective secrets filtering.

Conclusion: A benchmark for transparency in AI coding assistants is proposed, advocating improved user-centric privacy standards and offering actionable guidance for safer tool selection.

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

*Birk Torpmann-Hagen,Michael A. Riegler,Pål Halvorsen,Dag Johansen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies the threat of stegomalware embedded in deep neural networks and introduces a defense method using matrix reshuffling to neutralize the malicious payloads effectively without harming accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in sharing and distribution of neural network checkpoints has created vulnerabilities for stegomalware threats, which has been largely overlooked by both deep learning practitioners and security experts.

Method: The proposed method involves shuffling the column order in weight- and bias-matrices or the channel-order of convolutional layers, corrupting malicious payloads embedded in neural networks.

Result: The shuffling approach successfully neutralizes state-of-the-art stegomalware at no cost to the network’s accuracy, outperforming existing defense measures significantly.

Conclusion: The study highlights the security concerns in machine learning, demonstrates a robust defense method, and calls for continued research to bolster the security of such systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GANs are reviewed as both adversarial and defense tools in cybersecurity. The paper synthesizes recent advancements, highlights gaps, and proposes future directions for GAN-based defenses, covering architectures and domains like IoT and malware analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in cybersecurity is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. GANs offer potential for both enhancing defenses and enabling attacks, creating a need for systematic evaluation of their roles in cybersecurity applications.

Method: The paper employs a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review, analyzing 829 initial records and synthesizing 185 peer-reviewed studies through quantitative and thematic approaches. A four-dimensional taxonomy is introduced to classify findings.

Result: GANs show promise in enhancing detection accuracy and robustness in areas like network intrusion detection and IoT security, with advances like WGAN-GP and CGANs. Persistent issues include training instability, high computational costs, and lack of benchmarks.

Conclusion: While GAN-based defenses offer significant potential in cybersecurity, challenges like computational cost and explainability remain. Future work should focus on hybrid models, standardized evaluation, real-world deployment, and addressing emerging threats.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies privacy and security vulnerabilities in Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) by reviewing 67 related studies and proposes a taxonomy of 22 data risks within five categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QAI has immense transformative potential, but it inherits and introduces complex data risks. These risks compromise the trustworthiness of QAI systems, requiring systematic study.

Method: A systematic review of 67 privacy and security-related studies was conducted to identify and classify data risks specific to QAI.

Result: The study identifies a taxonomy of 22 key data risks categorized into governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user considerations, and continuous monitoring, and highlights vulnerabilities unique to QAI.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of QAI data risks and provide a framework for future risk assessment tools, contributing to the trustworthiness of AI and QAI systems.

Abstract: Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC), promises transformative advances,
including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically
studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI
systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for
developing future risk assessment tools.

### [465] [Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20589)
*Maria Chiper,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores character-level deep learning models for phishing email detection, analyzing their performance, robustness, and explainability under various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks are an escalating cybersecurity threat, and current detection methods lack explainability and robustness against evolving phishing tactics.

Method: The paper evaluates three character-level deep learning architectures (CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM) on a custom email dataset across standard, adversarial attack, and adversarial example scenarios. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is adapted for interpretability.

Result: Under constrained computational resources, CharGRU performs best across all scenarios. Adversarial attacks expose vulnerabilities in the models, but adversarial training improves robustness.

Conclusion: Character-level models combined with adversarial training offer enhanced phishing detection and robustness. Grad-CAM visualizations provide insights into model decisions. The study highlights CharGRU's effectiveness in limited-resource environments and shares its findings as open-source tools.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

### [466] [A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against Large Language Model Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20639)
*Adam Swanda,Amy Chang,Alexander Chen,Fraser Burch,Paul Kassianik,Konstantin Berlin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a production-grade defense system for Large Language Models (LLMs) inspired by malware detection practices, integrating threat intelligence, data management, and rapid response components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing autonomy and access permissions of LLMs have made them appealing targets for malicious attacks, necessitating robust defense mechanisms due to their susceptibility to zero-day or novel attacks.

Method: The proposed system integrates a threat intelligence function for identifying and mitigating emerging threats, a data platform for observability and monitoring, and a release platform for safe and rapid updates.

Result: The system provides layered protection against evolving threats, generates training data for continuous improvement, and deploys updates without disrupting operations.

Conclusion: This system demonstrates how established practices from malware detection can be adapted to create a robust, adaptive defense framework for protecting LLM applications from evolving security threats.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

*Xiao Liu,Mingyuan Li,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Wei Ni,Lixiang Li,Haipeng Peng,Renping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called BlockFUL for enabling efficient unlearning in blockchain-based federated learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in Federated Learning is challenging due to model inheritance complexities and blockchain-integrity issues.

Method: A novel dual-chain structure (live chain and archive chain) is introduced along with gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST validate that BlockFUL effectively reduces data dependency and computational overhead using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models.

Conclusion: BlockFUL enhances unlearning performance in blockchain-based federated systems, addressing major operational challenges effectively.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

### [468] [PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking with Channel Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21057)
*Jiahao Huo,Shuliang Liu,Bin Wang,Junyan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Aiwei Liu,Xuming Hu,Mingxun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMark, a semantic-level watermarking method for large language models, designed for enhanced robustness and distortion-free outputs compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic watermarking methods struggle with robustness in the face of paraphrasing attacks and produce distorted outputs compared to unwatermarked generation.

Method: The authors propose PMark, leveraging proxy functions for dynamic estimation of watermark evidence and enforcing multiple constraints to achieve watermark robustness without distortion.

Result: PMark surpasses existing semantic watermarking methods in terms of both text quality and resistance to paraphrasing attacks, providing theoretical guarantees and sampling efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: PMark presents an effective solution for semantic watermarking that balances robustness, text quality, and efficiency, offering a strong framework for detecting machine-generated text.

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

*Yu Liu,Boxiang He,Fanggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a security-focused integrated sensing and communication framework, SS-ISAC, using trainable residual networks for encryption and decryption to enhance privacy and system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in integrated sensing and communication systems, such as privacy leakage and eavesdropping threats, and optimize system security.

Method: Proposes SS-ISAC framework with pluggable encryption and decryption modules utilizing adversarial residual networks (ARNs) and jointly optimizing them via a loss function considering sensing, communication, and security aspects.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness for enhancing sensing and communication performance while preventing eavesdropping risks.

Conclusion: The proposed SS-ISAC framework offers a flexible and effective solution for securing integrated sensing and communication systems without requiring substantial hardware changes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops a robust and interpretable intrusion detection framework for drone networks, employing ensemble-based machine learning models for multi-class classification to address cybersecurity threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle cybersecurity risks in drone communication protocols involving complex attacks like spoofing and MITM by creating reliable detection mechanisms.

Method: The researchers employed ensemble-based machine learning models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost), combined with extensive data preprocessing and interpretability tools like SHAP and LIME.

Result: Random Forest showed the best performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000, validated through metrics and statistical tests.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology achieves exceptional detection accuracy while ensuring model interpretability, making it suitable for real-time drone cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the creation of an automated pipeline to collect and filter cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from Telegram, yielding a high-quality CTI dataset with high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for high-quality datasets for cyber threat intelligence, using Telegram as a timely CTI source.

Method: An end-to-end automated pipeline was implemented, which collects, filters, and classifies threat-related messages from Telegram channels using a BERT-based model with 96.64% accuracy.

Result: The pipeline identified 12 relevant channels from 150 sources and produced a dataset containing 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable approach to CTI data collection, creating a high-fidelity dataset and enabling future operational and research advancements in cyber threat detection.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

*Ibrahim Altan,Abdulla Bachir,Yousuf Parbhulkar,Abdul Muksith Rizvi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-path phishing detection framework integrating transformer-based NLP and classical machine learning for improved analysis of email text and URLs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing emails exploit semantic and structural vulnerabilities, and traditional detection methods fail to comprehensively address evolving threats.

Method: The framework combines semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) with structural link analysis via TF-IDF vectorization and classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvement in detection accuracy, with DistilBERT balancing efficiency and Random Forest excelling in identifying malicious URLs.

Conclusion: The dual-path approach is scalable, accurate, and interpretable, offering a practical solution to enhance email security against phishing threats.

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

*Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay,Subhamoy Maitra*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores cryptographic backdoors in neural networks for both attacks and defenses, proposing practical, provably robust protocols for watermarking, authentication, and intellectual property tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate dual-purpose cryptographic backdoors to understand their potential for mounting powerful attacks and enabling robust defenses in neural networks.

Method: Theoretical tools inspired by Goldwasser et al. [FOCS 2022] are utilized to design and analyze protocols for watermarking, authentication, and intellectual property tracking. These protocols are empirically implemented on state-of-the-art neural networks.

Result: The proposed protocols show provable robustness against black-box adversaries while demonstrating their practicality in neural network architectures. Post-quantum primitives are also explored for future ML applications.

Conclusion: Cryptographic backdoors can both enable potent attacks and provide robust defenses in neural networks. The implications open avenues for security applications in the current and quantum computational landscapes, though further studies are needed for defense proofs.

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL
pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations.
We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a stable and accurate closure model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of 2D turbulence, addressing limitations of prior 2nd-order expansion models.

Method: The study uses AI and fluid physics with small DNS data to explore sparse-equation discovery and includes inter-scale energy transfer in the model derivation.

Result: A new closure, derived from the 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion, was found to be accurate, stable, and capable of reproducing DNS statistics.

Conclusion: The incorporation of inter-scale energy transfer and higher-order terms improves LES stability and accuracy, advancing turbulence modeling.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D
turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy
simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS
statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could
be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and
AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES.
The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered
alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

TL;DR: The paper develops an optimal transport-based method for improving blind hyperspectral unmixing in highly mixed data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the accuracy and robustness of hyperspectral unmixing techniques, especially under conditions involving highly mixed data.

Method: The proposed method involves constraining the abundance matrix distribution via optimal transport to minimize discrepancies between the estimated and targeted (Dirichlet) distributions, implemented as a regularization term.

Result: The experiments demonstrate improved estimation of endmembers in challenging high-mix scenarios, showing the approach's robustness towards the choice of target distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed optimal transport-based approach enhances blind hyperspectral unmixing by leveraging regularization, offering improved accuracy and robustness over standard methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.
