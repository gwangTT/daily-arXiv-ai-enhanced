Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues\nof the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player\nbehaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward\nthe puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization\nUsing Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and\ncontext-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2\\% and RSLE average precision of 25\\%.

However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to\nbackdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can\nmanipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has\nproposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving\nbackdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies\ntargeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical\nbecause they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before\nediting. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds\ninvisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.\nWe leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible\nwatermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the\npredefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing\nclean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments\nacross different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising\nattack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark\ncharacteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of\nour approach.

These tools can alter\nstyles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as\nspectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel\nmusic. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which\nmakes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input\naccurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective\nand requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.\nIn this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the\nperformance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The\nhuman-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to\nuse as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic\nalgorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance\nof a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this\napproach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each\niteration.
