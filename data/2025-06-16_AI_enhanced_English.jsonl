This\npaper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that\nleverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other\ncrowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays\nstripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions\nacross demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.\nWe explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question\nphrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag\ndata segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and\nmachine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals\nfrom non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that\nvisual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.\nThis approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to\nconventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,\ncrowdsourced bias detection pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a perception-driven framework for bias detection using a crowdsourced web platform to visually identify anomalies in fairness across demographic groups.", "motivation": "Traditional bias detection methods require sensitive data or rigid fairness metrics, limiting their use in practical, real-world applications.", "method": "A web platform is designed to collect judgments from users on visual data (e.g., salary distributions) to highlight disparities.

In this paper, we propose\na novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel\ncode translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of\ntwo models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of\nCo-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate\ndata for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests\nto verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving\nthe Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented\ninput to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to\nQwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester\nperformance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while\nachieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Existing\nresearch focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model\noutput quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense\nmechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals\nthat poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and\nclarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This\nnovel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness\nissues of the RAG system.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework to highlight how poisoning attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems amplify biases in language models, and proposes a dual-stage defense mechanism.", "motivation": "To address the overlooked impact of poisoning attacks in RAG systems on amplifying bias in large language models.", "method": "The authors design adversarial document generation leveraging multi-objective rewards, use subspace projection techniques for biased retrieval manipulation, and construct a cyclic feedback for continuous bias amplification.", "result": "Experiments validate that BRRA attacks significantly increase model biases in multiple dimensions.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that RAG system security directly affects model fairness, and calls attention to fairness concerns in RAG systems."}}

Knowing how clients\nare using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug\nreports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of\na bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API\nis used.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage\nacross 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a\ncombined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how\nwell library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for\nlibrary developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API\nusage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that\nlibrary developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use\ntheir API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a\npopular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by\nthe library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be\nleveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%\nwith the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the\nAPIs are used in the field.\n  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be\nused to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce\nvarious metrics useful to library developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores API usage vs. testing in 21 popular C libraries, highlighting the gaps in library testing.
