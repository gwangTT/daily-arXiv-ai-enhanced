While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies.

However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation.

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP.

Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability.

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries.

Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic).

However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup.

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG.

It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion.

However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning.

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions.

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies.

We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors.

Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain.

In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings.

Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries.

Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Traditional GNNs for link prediction struggle due to their focus on local representations.

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a variationally correct framework and Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO) to enhance physical consistency and accuracy for neural operators solving partial differential equations (PDEs).", "motivation": "The motivation arises from the limitations of standard PDE-residual loss formulations, which lack variational correctness and result in unreliable solution errors.

Under review", "summary": "The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study examines the interrelations of key learning factors in AI-augmented educational environments, revealing distinct perceptions between middle and high school students.", "motivation": "To address gaps in understanding of how key learning factors interrelate in AI-mediated education and vary across age groups.", "method": "Study conducted in classrooms using AI tools for programming activities; data analyzed via correlation analysis and text mining.", "result": "Middle school students exhibit holistic positive perception interrelations, while high school students show differentiated, independent evaluations.", "conclusion": "Findings highlight developmental stage impacts on learning perceptions, guiding tailored AI integration strategies for education."}}

These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients.
