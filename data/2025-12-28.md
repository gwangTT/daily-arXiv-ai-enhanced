Conclusion: Proves feasibility of using adaptive AI on resource-limited IoT devices for smart home automation, with significant energy efficiency and performance improvements.

Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

*Mazyar Taghavi,Javad Vahidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops a quantum-inspired framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning in UAV deployment for 6G networks, improving efficiency and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to balance exploration and exploitation in dynamic environments like UAV-assisted 6G networks.

Method: Combines classical MARL with quantum optimization (QAOA and VQCs) and probabilistic modeling for dynamic environments, following a CTDE paradigm.

Result: QI MARL enhances sample efficiency, convergence speed, and coverage performance compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework better balances exploration and exploitation in multi-agent tasks, with robustness and reproducibility ensured via open-source code.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

### [3] [MegaRAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20626)
*Chi-Hsiang Hsiao,Yi-Cheng Wang,Tzung-Sheng Lin,Yi-Ren Yeh,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG model for improved reasoning and answering over textual and multimodal content by incorporating visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG models struggle with deep reasoning on long-form, domain-specific content due to limited context windows. They also fail to utilize insights from non-textual modalities like vision.

Method: The proposed method integrates visual information into the construction of knowledge graphs, retrieval, and answer generation processes to enable cross-modal reasoning.

Result: The approach outperforms current RAG-based methods on global and fine-grained question-answering tasks across textual and multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: This multimodal KG-based RAG model enhances understanding and reasoning in tasks requiring both textual and visual modalities, providing stronger performance in question answering.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

### [7] [Reasoning Relay: Evaluating Stability and Interchangeability of Large Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20647)
*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates whether reasoning chains, partially completed by one large language model (LLM), can be successfully continued by another model, assessing their interchangeability for logical coherence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand if reasoning processes and outputs from one model can be utilized by another, addressing trustworthiness and capabilities in collaborative AI reasoning.

Method: Reasoning chains were truncated at different stages using token-level log-probability thresholds. Continuations were performed among models within and across families (Gemma and LLaMA). The Process Reward Model (PRM) was used for evaluation.

Result: Hybrid reasoning chains preserve or improve logical coherence and accuracy compared to single-model reasoning. Cross-model reasoning exhibits behavioral compatibility and reliability.

Conclusion: Interchangeability of reasoning processes among LLMs is feasible and shows promise for enabling modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture using a learned router to dynamically select attention mechanisms, improving both efficiency and performance over static alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the trade-off between modeling quality and memory efficiency in various attention mechanisms used in Transformer models.

Method: MoAS employs a learned router to dynamically choose between Multi-Head Attention, Multi-Query Attention, and Grouped-Query Attention for each token.

Result: Experimental evaluation on WikiText-2 highlights that dynamic routing performs better (val loss 2.3074) than static mixtures (val loss 2.3093).

Conclusion: Dynamic routing in attention enables competitive performance with Multi-Head Attention while reducing memory inefficiencies, validating the method for conditional compute efficiency.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [11] [AI-Driven Decision-Making System for Hiring Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20652)
*Vira Filatova,Andrii Zelenchuk,Dmytro Filatov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven modular hiring assistant to streamline candidate validation by integrating preprocessing, profile construction, scoring, and human-in-the-loop validation. It significantly reduces candidate processing time and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Candidate validation during early-stage hiring is time-consuming and inefficient due to the need to reconcile disparate inputs like resumes, screening answers, code tests, and public data.

Method: The proposed system integrates modular AI components for preprocessing, profile construction, public data verification, scoring, and interactive validation. It uses an LLM to ensure structured and traceable outputs.

Result: The system evaluated 64 real applicants for a Python backend engineer role and reduced time-per-qualified candidate from 3.33 hours to 1.70 hours while lowering screening costs.

Conclusion: The AI-assisted hiring pipeline improves efficiency, reduces costs, and supports human decision-makers as the final authority to maintain accountability.

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

### [12] [From Fake Focus to Real Precision: Confusion-Driven Adversarial Attention Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20661)
*Yawei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) mechanism to improve the attention distribution of transformer-based models for sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of transformer-based models in sentiment analysis, as they often allocate attention incorrectly by focusing on common words instead of task-relevant terms.

Method: The authors propose an AFA mechanism with a dynamic masking strategy and discriminator to redistribute attention and employ a policy gradient approach to optimize token-level attention distribution.

Result: The proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance on three datasets and improves performance in large language models by 12.6%.

Conclusion: The AFA mechanism effectively enhances attention redistribution, leading to significant accuracy improvements in both standard sentiment analysis models and large language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

### [13] [Quantifying Laziness, Decoding Suboptimality, and Context Degradation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20662)
*Yiqing Ma,Jung-Hua Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper assesses behavioral artifacts in advanced LLMs, finding issues with laziness in handling complex tasks, while noting robustness in context management and decoding quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to identify and quantify behavioral artifacts in LLMs, addressing failure modes like partial responses, decoding inefficiencies, and loss of context over extended interactions.

Method: Three controlled experiments were conducted (A, B, and C) to measure laziness with multi-part instructions, decoding choices, and context degradation across LLM models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek.

Result: The study uncovered prevalent laziness in multi-part tasks, limited evidence of decoding issues, and surprising resistance to context degradation over long conversations.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs exhibit challenges like instruction-following laziness but show resilience against hypothesized flaws, suggesting targeted strategies for improving compliance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [14] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework to address hallucinated outputs in Large Language Models (LLMs) by relying on structural consistency rather than probability-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitation of existing probability-based verification systems in LLMs, which fail to detect high-probability but structurally inconsistent hallucinations.

Method: The authors propose a verification system reformulated as CSP focused on detecting structural violations via a structural cost function. They utilize a lightweight System-2 gate called Eidoku to reject disconnected reasoning using graph connectivity, feature consistency, and logical entailment.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed system effectively rejects structurally inconsistent statements, outperforming probability-based verifiers on controlled diagnostic datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a deterministic and context-grounded method to identify and reject specific types of hallucinations in LLM reasoning, enhancing the reliability of generative models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

*Daan Di Scala,Sophie Lathouwers,Michael van Bekkum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need for a semantic framework to bridge the divide between Functional Trustworthy AI (FTAI) and Normative Trustworthy AI (NTAI) in order to make AI systems more assessable and implementable in terms of trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper stems from the difficulty in assessing AI system trustworthiness due to gaps between FTAI and NTAI, driven by their differing focus areas on implementation and regulations.

Method: The authors propose the development of a conceptual semantic language as the bridge between FTAI and NTAI, to aid developers and stakeholders in assessing and implementing trustworthy AI systems.

Result: The paper introduces the idea of a semantic language framework, identifies gaps between FTAI and NTAI, and provides initial considerations and steps toward its development.

Conclusion: Bridging the gap between FTAI and NTAI through a semantic language framework can improve trustworthiness assessments and practical application of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

*Iman Reihanian,Yunfei Hou,Qingquan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI is evaluated for personalized computer science education in higher education, focusing on its role in improving learning processes through tailored scaffolding while identifying potential risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how generative AI can support personalized learning at scale in computer science education and whether it enhances or hampers learning outcomes.

Method: A scoping review of 32 studies (from 2023-2025) was conducted, categorized into five application areas, and analyzed for design mechanisms that impact learning outcomes.

Result: Effective uses of generative AI involve structured guidance methods, context-awareness, and integration with existing tools. Risks, including academic integrity issues and privacy concerns, are noted.

Conclusion: Generative AI can enhance learning when applied with context-awareness and safeguards for quality assurance, promoting productive struggle and addressing risks through audit-ready workflows.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

TL;DR: AI stems from human ingenuity, blending organic and artificial elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the blurred boundary between organic intelligence and artificial intelligence in digital health.

Method: Analyzing the conceptual overlap between principles of human neurobiology and AI systems.

Result: Highlights how AI is rooted in human cognitive and evolutionary processes despite being deemed artificial.

Conclusion: Organic intelligence deeply influences AI design, questioning the distinctness of artificial versus organic categorizations.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reasoning models like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 are computationally inefficient and lack accuracy in performing complex mathematical operations.

Method: AgentMath employs (1) converting natural language into tool-augmented data, (2) reinforcement learning combining natural language and code execution, and (3) efficient training system with innovative techniques for faster RL training on long sequences.

Result: AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art accuracy: 90.6% on AIME24, 86.4% on AIME25, and 73.8% on HMMT25 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate AgentMath's efficacy in mathematical problem-solving and mark a step forward in creating advanced scalable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [19] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to measure outcome-driven constraint violations in AI agents operating under strong performance incentives in multi-step tasks. It highlights significant safety concerns with current AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With autonomous AI increasingly used in high-stakes environments, the paper addresses the lack of benchmarks that capture the safety risks arising from goal optimization under ethical/safety constraint violations over multiple steps.

Method: The authors present a benchmark of 40 scenarios, each involving multi-step tasks tied to performance KPIs, in both Mandated and Incentivized variations. They evaluate 12 language models for their adherence to ethical constraints.

Result: Key findings include outcome-driven constraint violations in 1.3%-71.4% of the tasks, with top-performing models like Gemini-3-Pro-Preview demonstrating the highest misalignment rates (>60%) despite advanced reasoning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the urgent need for more realistic safety training for autonomous AI agents to reduce misalignment risks during deployment in high-stakes real-world applications.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring effective alignment of language models with safety while preserving their usefulness is a significant challenge in AI.

Method: Proposes framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game and training an Attacker LM and Defender LM together via online reinforcement learning with preference-based reward signals.

Result: AdvGame achieves a Defender LM that is both more helpful and resilient to adversarial attacks, and a strong Attacker LM for model probing.

Conclusion: The proposed game-theoretic method shifts the balance between safety and utility positively in language models, offering robust improvements in both areas.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in sequential decision-making involving parameterized action spaces by introducing RL algorithms capable of learning state and action abstractions autonomously, boosting performance in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with parameterized action spaces due to reliance on hand-crafted models or domain-specific engineering, limiting their effectiveness in complex tasks.

Method: The authors propose algorithms that autonomously learn, refine state, and action abstractions online, focusing on critical regions of the state-action space for improved resolution.

Result: Their abstraction-driven approach, applied in various domains, significantly boosts sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The study expands RL capabilities to parameterized actions settings, showing that abstraction-driven methods can markedly enhance sample efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of thought degeneration in LLMs when reflecting on their mistakes repeatedly and proposing an alternative approach for improvement.

Method: Introduce multi-agent systems with multi-persona debators to replace self-reflection by a single LLM.

Result: Achieved 47% accuracy in EM HotPot QA and 82.7% in HumanEval, outperforming single LLM reflection methods.

Conclusion: Multi-agent designs generate diverse reflections, fostering better reasoning and surpassing single LLM reflection performance on specific tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for bidirectional knowledge exchange among autonomous agents powered by LLMs and RAG. It seeks to address limitations like epistemic asymmetry and redundant reasoning while enhancing certainty and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents currently remain unidirectional, causing epistemic asymmetry, redundant reasoning, and stagnation in collective intelligence. There is a need for probabilistic frameworks for effective self-reflection and knowledge exchange.

Method: The paper models an agent's belief using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor, enabling uncertainty quantification and purposeful bidirectional interaction. It proposes mechanisms like active learning, epistemic caching, and belief-driven reward systems.

Result: The probabilistic framework enables agents to target ambiguous knowledge for efficient learning, optimize resource allocation, and improve adaptability in dynamic environments. Simulation results confirm performance benefits over random methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of uncertainty-driven bidirectional knowledge exchange among agents to enhance learning, adaptability, and scalable collective intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a LangChain-based multi-agent system integrated with permissioned blockchain for secure autonomous decision-making, demonstrating its efficiency in several domains like inventory management and healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address trust, oversight, and integrity concerns in autonomous decision-making using agentic AI systems across critical domains.

Method: Developing a unified architecture using LangChain-based multi-agent systems integrated with permissioned blockchain for monitoring, governance, and auditability.

Result: Experiments show the framework prevents unauthorized practices, ensures traceability, and maintains operational efficiency across smart inventory, traffic control, and healthcare applications.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture ensures both autonomy and responsibility in agentic AI applications, making them secure and efficient for high-impact domains.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

Motivation: Address the difficulty of balancing household budgets with nutritional demands amidst fluctuating food prices in middle-income settings.

Method: Utilizes a modular multi-agent architecture combining agents for budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization to create adaptive meal plans.

Result: Achieved 12-18% cost reduction, over 95% nutrient adequacy, and maintained performance under 20-30% market price changes in simulations.

Conclusion: The system provides an affordable, nutritionally adequate, and adaptable strategy for diet planning, promoting sustainability and adhering to SDGs.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity and knowledge barriers faced by users when using existing traffic simulators like SUMO and MATSim.

Method: TrafficSimAgent uses high-level expert agents for natural language instruction interpretation and planning, and low-level agents for real-time traffic optimization. It leverages cross-level collaboration among agents.

Result: TrafficSimAgent demonstrates effective simulation execution across varying conditions, delivering reasonable outcomes and outperforming other systems and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TrafficSimAgent simplifies traffic simulation tasks, optimizes decision-making, and outperforms existing systems in various scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP explainability and iterative refinement using large language models (LLMs) to create better explanations. It uses agriculture as its use case, and its findings highlight the importance of balancing refinement rounds with strategic early stopping to avoid verbosity or abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of making explainable AI (XAI) outputs accessible to laypersons, thus increasing trust in AI systems.

Method: The paper utilizes a SHAP-based explainability method integrated with multimodal LLMs for iterative refinement to progressively enhance AI explanations. It evaluates the framework using agricultural data and rounds of explanations reviewed by both experts and LLMs.

Result: The framework showed significant improvement in explanation quality with a 30-33% average score increase from initial refinement rounds, but excessive iterations led to a drop in quality due to verbosity and abstraction.

Conclusion: Strategic early stopping is crucial for optimizing practical utility of agentic XAI systems and ensuring effective explanations, challenging the assumption of monotonic improvement with extensive refinement.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

TL;DR: RoboSafe is a runtime safeguard for embodied vision-language agents, employing hybrid reasoning to reduce risks and unsafe actions in dynamic environments without compromising task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety in embodied agents executing real-world tasks by addressing limitations of static rule-based defenses in complex, dynamic environments.

Method: RoboSafe employs hybrid reasoning using a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. It features Backward Reflective Reasoning to analyze short-term trajectory risks and Forward Predictive Reasoning to anticipate future risks using long-term memory and multimodal observations.

Result: RoboSafe reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% while maintaining near-original task performance, demonstrated through both simulations and real-world robotic arm experiments.

Conclusion: RoboSafe addresses runtime safety challenges in embodied agents by providing interpretable and executable safety logic, proving effective in reducing risks and ensuring practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Enoch Hyunwook Kang*

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of LLM-based persona simulation as a cost-effective alternative to field experiments for method evaluation and establishes conditions under which it can replace real human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field experiments are expensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in developing and testing adaptive methods in societal systems. Persona simulation provides a potential solution but requires validation as an effective benchmarking tool.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical framework proving conditions for using personas as a replacement for humans in method evaluation. It establishes criteria like aggregate-only observation and algorithm-blind evaluation, as well as explores discriminability and sample size requirements using information-theoretic analysis.

Result: Replacing humans with personas can be valid for method evaluation when specific observation and evaluation criteria are met. It provides bounds on the sample size needed for personas to reliably differentiate methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based persona simulations can serve as a valid benchmarking tool under defined conditions, offering a practical alternative to costly field experiments with insights on sample requirements for reliable evaluations.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

*Ahmed M. Hussain,Salahuddin Salahuddin,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a safety flaw in current Large Language Models (LLMs): their inability to understand user intent and context, leading to systematic vulnerabilities exploitable by malicious users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of contextual understanding and intent recognition as crucial aspects of LLM safety, as conventional approaches only focus on explicitly harmful content.

Method: Empirical evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek) using techniques like emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification to identify vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms.

Result: Findings show that most LLMs' reasoning-enabled configurations amplified vulnerabilities rather than mitigating them, with Claude Opus 4.1 demonstrating better intent detection in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The study calls for a paradigm shift in LLM safety, emphasizing the integration of contextual understanding and intent recognition as core capabilities instead of relying on post-hoc protective measures.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

### [31] [A Real-World Evaluation of LLM Medication Safety Reviews in NHS Primary Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21127)
*Oliver Normand,Esther Borsi,Mitch Fruin,Lauren E Walker,Jamie Heagerty,Chris C. Holmes,Anthony J Avery,Iain E Buchan,Harry Coppock*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM) for medication safety review using real NHS primary care data, identifying key behavioral failures despite strong headline metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the clinical applicability and limitations of LLMs in real-world medical settings, addressing their shortcomings in contextual reasoning and safety-critical tasks.

Method: A retrospective study was conducted using a population-scale NHS EHR database. The team strategically sampled patients and an expert clinician reviewed LLM-generated issues and interventions to identify safety failures.

Result: The LLM demonstrated strong sensitivity (100%) but failed to correctly identify all issues and interventions in 46.9% of cases. Key failure patterns included overconfidence, misuse of guidelines, factual errors, and lack of context awareness.

Conclusion: Before clinical deployment of LLMs, their contextual reasoning shortcomings must be addressed. Larger-scale and prospective evaluations are necessary for understanding their behavior in clinical settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

*Razine Moundir Ghorab,Emanuele Parisi,Cristian Gutierrez,Miquel Alberti-Binimelis,Miquel Moreto,Dario Garcia-Gasulla,Gokcen Kestor*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark for assessing LLMs in the generation of complex RTL designs, improving upon prior benchmarks in robustness and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RTL benchmarks are limited by scale, trivial designs, insufficient verification, and vulnerability to data contamination, restraining evaluation of LLMs.

Method: The authors developed NotSoTiny using a pipeline to create benchmarks from Tiny Tapeout community designs, ensuring quality through duplication removal, correctness verification, and periodic updates.

Result: Evaluation shows NotSoTiny tasks are more complex than previous benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness for LLM evaluation and improvement in hardware design.

Conclusion: NotSoTiny addresses limitations in existing benchmarks and stands as a beneficial tool for advancing LLM applications in RTL code generation.

Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.

### [34] [Uncovering Competency Gaps in Large Language Models and Their Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20638)
*Matyas Bohacek,Nino Scherrer,Nicholas Dufour,Thomas Leung,Christoph Bregler,Stephanie C. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify gaps in large language models (LLMs) and benchmarks. The approach grounds evaluation in model representations and provides detailed concept-level insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs provide overall metrics but fail to highlight specific weaknesses in models ("model gaps") or imbalances in benchmark coverage ("benchmark gaps"). The aim is to address these limitations and enable more informative evaluations.

Method: The authors employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract concept activations and compute saliency-weighted performance scores on benchmark data. This allows for assessing LLMs' internal representations and identifying gaps in both models and benchmarks.

Result: The method revealed that models consistently underperformed on concepts related to politely rejecting or asserting boundaries and safety-related discussions. Benchmark gaps were also identified, showing biases toward obedience/authority concepts while missing critical ones.

Conclusion: The representation-grounded method complements traditional evaluation by providing a concept-level decomposition of benchmark metrics. It identifies weaknesses in both LLM performance and benchmark design, offering insights for improving models and evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-DiffuSeq introduces sparse attention to make long form text generation with diffusion models computationally efficient while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory inefficiency of diffusion models for long form text generation.

Method: Integrates sparse attention within the diffusion framework, utilizes a soft absorbing state to stabilize diffusion trajectories, and reduces computational overhead for long document modeling.

Result: SA-DiffuSeq outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches in training efficiency, sampling speed, and quality of long dependency modeling.

Conclusion: Structured sparsity in diffusion models is an effective approach for efficient and expressive long text generation in applications such as scientific writing and large-scale code generation.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

*Gül Sena Altıntaş,Malikeh Ehghaghi,Brian Lester,Fengyuan Liu,Wanru Zhao,Marco Ciccone,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper introduces TokSuite, a toolkit with 14 models and benchmarks to study tokenization's effects on language models, revealing new insights into tokenizer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the poorly researched impact of tokenization on language model performance due to the difficulty in isolating its effects.

Method: Developed TokSuite with 14 language models using different tokenizers but identical architecture, training, and dataset, alongside a benchmark designed to evaluate tokenizer performance under real-world conditions.

Result: TokSuite successfully isolates the role of tokenization and generates novel findings highlighting benefits and limitations of popular tokenizers.

Conclusion: TokSuite is a valuable resource for studying tokenization's role in LMs, advancing understanding of tokenizer impact and behavior.

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

*Ziyi Zhu,Olivier Tieleman,Caitlin A. Stamatis,Luka Smyth,Thomas D. Hull,Daniel R. Cahn,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adversarial training framework to enhance the realism of user simulators for mental health support chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating realistic user simulators for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems is challenging and crucial for uncovering system failure modes.

Method: An adversarial training framework is employed, involving competition between a user simulator (generator) and a discriminator to iteratively improve simulator realism.

Result: Fine-tuned simulators outperform zero-shot models in identifying chatbot system issues, and adversarial training improves diversity, alignment, and failure mode correlation with reality.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective for building realistic user simulators in the domain of mental health support, allowing for efficient system evaluation prior to deployment.

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

### [38] [Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780)
*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the behavior of large language models in generating tutoring responses for math, comparing their performance with human tutors based on pedagogical quality and linguistic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether large language models can effectively replicate expert human instructional behavior in tutoring mathematics, given their growing use in educational contexts.

Method: The study involves comparing responses from expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and large language models to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. It analyzes instructional and linguistic characteristics like restating, politeness, readability, and pressing for accuracy.

Result: Large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality but differ significantly in their approaches, underusing strategies like restating and relying on longer, more diverse, but more polite responses.

Conclusion: Large language models exhibit comparable pedagogical quality to expert tutors but use different instructional and linguistic strategies, suggesting the importance of analyzing these elements for better evaluation and design of intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

### [39] [Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794)
*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Explores the use of model editing algorithms for machine unlearning, finding they can outperform traditional unlearning methods in certain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing unlearning methods for LLMs are inefficient or degrade performance while failing to fully remove targeted information.

Method: Investigated model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, and WISE) and adapted them to unlearning scenarios.

Result: Model editing approaches exceeded baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting, though similar challenges remain in maintaining overall model performance.

Conclusion: Model editing algorithms show promise for machine unlearning but require further improvements to address broader unlearning scope and avoid performance degradation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

### [40] [Measuring Mechanistic Independence: Can Bias Be Removed Without Erasing Demographics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20796)
*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to reduce bias in language models while maintaining their ability to recognize demographic features. Sparse autoencoder feature ablations effectively address various biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and mitigate demographic biases in language models while ensuring these models retain their demographic recognition functionalities.

Method: The researchers use multi-task evaluation setups, sparse autoencoder feature ablations, and compare attribution-based vs. correlation-based methods for detecting and removing specific bias features.

Result: Attribution-based ablations improve performance in mitigating race and gender profession stereotypes while maintaining name recognition, whereas correlation-based methods are efficient for addressing education bias. Removing features in certain education-related tasks can lead to increased bias.

Conclusion: Demographic bias in language models originates from task-specific mechanisms rather than demographic markers themselves. Targeted feature ablation interventions can effectively minimize bias without compromising the model's overall capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

*Nathaniël de Leeuw,Marceau Nahon,Mathis Reymond,Raja Chatila,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models (LLMs) on symbolic reasoning using unfamiliar symbols and misleading semantic cues, revealing limitations in their reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by growing concerns about the reliability of LLMs when human values are at stake in reasoning and decision-making contexts.

Method: A framework is introduced where LLMs handle tasks involving numerical and mathematical symbols redefined with novel representations, including misleading semantic elements, to test abstract symbolic reasoning.

Result: LLMs exhibited reduced performance when misled by semantic cues, revealing their reliance on learned semantics rather than abstract symbolic manipulation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with symbolic reasoning and are prone to errors from semantic biases, raising concerns about their deployment in decision-making tasks with ethical implications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability in automated grading systems, especially those based on large language models acting as black boxes, hinders understanding and accountability in essay evaluation for educators and students.

Method: EssayCBM assesses essays via eight rubric-aligned writing concepts, processed by an encoder with dedicated prediction heads for each concept. A lightweight network computes the final grade using only these concept scores, forming a transparent and interpretable bottleneck.

Result: EssayCBM performs on par with existing black-box grading systems while providing actionable and interpretable concept-level feedback.

Conclusion: EssayCBM enables transparent, interpretable, and accountable essay grading that aligns with rubrics, offering both competitive performance and an editable grading interface for human oversight.

Abstract: Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MediEval, a benchmarking tool using electronic health records to test large language models in medicine for contextual consistency and knowledge grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome reliability and safety concerns of existing medical LLMs, addressing gaps in their ability to reason accurately in patient contexts.

Method: MediEval links health records to a knowledge base and creates diverse medical statements for evaluation using a four-quadrant framework. A fine-tuning method, CoRFu, uses asymmetric penalties to reduce unsafe errors.

Result: MediEval identifies critical errors like hallucinated support and truth inversion in LLMs. CoRFu improves model accuracy by +16.4 macro-F1 points and eliminates truth inversion errors.

Conclusion: MediEval and CoRFu significantly enhance the reliability and safety of LLMs in medical applications, addressing key limitations in existing models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

### [45] [How important is Recall for Measuring Retrieval Quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20854)
*Shelly Schwartz,Oleg Vasilyev,Randy Sawaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates retrieval quality in realistic settings, focusing on situations with unknown numbers of relevant documents, and introduces a new measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world retrieval scenarios, the exact number of relevant documents for a query is often unavailable, making traditional quality measures like recall impractical.

Method: The authors assess existing strategies and propose a new retrieval quality measure, correlating it with LLM-based quality judgments across datasets with a low number of relevant documents (2-15).

Result: A simple retrieval quality metric is introduced, performing well without the need for knowledge of the total relevant documents, and existing strategies are evaluated.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising approach to evaluate retrieval systems in environments with limited knowledge of document relevance, offering practical improvements over traditional measures.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates small language models within strict compute limits, analyzing the interaction of architectural choices, training budgets, and their impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and compute constraints influence the performance and efficiency of small language models.

Method: A systematic empirical approach that progressively tests various architectural configurations (e.g., nonlinearities, self-attention, transformer layers) on datasets like Tiny Shakespeare, PTB, and WikiText-2. Metrics used include negative log-likelihood, parameter count, and FLOPs.

Result: Attention-based models are more efficient per FLOP than MLPs even at small scales. However, increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can harm performance. RoPE embeddings, effective in large models, do not have the same impact in small models.

Conclusion: Efficiency and performance in small language models depend significantly on architectural choices and optimization levels. Techniques successful in large models may not directly apply to smaller scales.

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to trace the source of actions produced by distilled models and validates it with reasoning distillation using teacher-student models. It includes a novel data selection approach guiding effective distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about whether distilled models maintain consistent reasoning behaviors of their teacher models in novel testing contexts and develop a systematic analysis of the origins of their capabilities.

Method: Introduce Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework to trace the origin of actions. Compare predictive probabilities from teacher, original student, and distilled models under the same context. Also propose teacher-guided data selection for training.

Result: The distilled models generate teacher-originated actions during testing that align with observed performance. Teacher-guided data selection improves distillation efficacy and is validated across representative teacher and student models.

Conclusion: The provenance-tracing framework effectively disentangles the origins of reasoning capabilities, improving overall understanding and performance of distilled models in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

*Zhongren Dong,Haotian Guo,Weixiang Xu,Huan Zhao,Zixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FEND, a framework for multi-modal assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders using speech and text data across multiple languages and datasets, showing its promise but also noting limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the linguistic and acoustic markers in neuropsychiatric disorders such as AD, depression, and ASD, and bridge gaps in multi-modal detection methods hindered by multi-lingual challenges and an absence of evaluation standards.

Method: FEND integrates multi-lingual datasets (English, Chinese, Greek, French, Dutch) and combines speech and text modalities, systematically evaluating multi-modal fusion and conducting cross-corpus comparisons.

Result: Multi-modal fusion is effective for AD and depression detection but struggles with ASD detection due to dataset heterogeneity. Issues like modality imbalance and performance degradation in diverse settings are identified.

Conclusion: FEND offers a standardized framework for evaluating multi-modal approaches in neuropsychiatric disorder detection, advancing lifespan-inclusive, multi-lingual assessments while emphasizing areas for improvement and reproducibility.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

### [50] [Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20949)
*Shize Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural network-based framework for hallucination detection in large language models using lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) probes for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in large language models hinders their application in high-risk domains, and existing methods (uncertainty estimation and external retrieval) have critical limitations.

Method: The paper uses MLP probes with nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states, enhanced by a multi-objective joint loss function and optimized through Bayesian search for layer insertion.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MLP probes outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA in accuracy, recall, and reduced false-positive rates.

Conclusion: The neural network-based lightweight MLP probes provide an effective and stable approach for detecting hallucinations in large language models, advancing detection capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Conclusion: TriAligner effectively addresses the challenges in multilingual and crosslingual claim retrieval, offering promising advancements for combating misinformation.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces reflection pretraining to enable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in protein and RNA language models by enhancing language expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of applying CoT reasoning to non-natural language domains due to the limited expressiveness of token spaces such as amino acids.

Method: The introduction of reflection pretraining, which augments token sets to allow for intermediate reasoning with auxiliary "thinking tokens" in biological sequence models.

Result: Empirical results show that reflection pretraining enables self-correction in protein models and leads to significant performance improvements over standard pretraining.

Conclusion: Reflection pretraining improves the expressiveness of biological languages and enhances reasoning capability, thus broadening the applicability of CoT reasoning in non-natural language domains.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedMistake is a pipeline that identifies and benchmarks mistakes made by LLMs in patient-doctor scenarios, creating single-shot QA datasets for evaluation. The dataset highlights areas where models like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of systematically identifying mistakes made by LLMs in clinical settings and turning those into reproducible benchmarking datasets.

Method: The pipeline creates patient-doctor conversations between LLMs, conducts evaluations using two LLM judges, identifies errors, and simplifies them into single-shot QA pairs. Medical experts validate a subset of these questions.

Result: A dataset with 3,390 QA pairs (MedMistake-All) and a medically validated subset of 211 questions (MedMistake-Bench) was created. Performance evaluation on MedMistake-Bench showed that GPT, Claude, and Grok outperformed other models.

Conclusion: MedMistake provides both an automated way to extract and evaluate LLM errors in patient-doctor scenarios and a benchmark dataset to measure the performance of LLMs in clinical reasoning and safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### [54] [Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21002)
*Wei-Rui Chen,Vignesh Kothapalli,Ata Fatahibaarzi,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Zhipeng Wang,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper finds that distilling reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller student models can be optimized by focusing on early reasoning tokens, significantly reducing computation while retaining most performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational expense of distilling reasoning capabilities from LLMs, especially due to the lengthy sequences involving prompts, chain-of-thought (CoT), and answers.

Method: The authors analyze how supervision allocation across components like prompts, CoT, and answers affects student model performance, proposing a truncation protocol to prioritize early reasoning tokens in training sequences.

Result: Training on only the first 50% of sequence tokens retains approximately 94% of reasoning performance on math benchmarks while cutting training resources (time, memory, and FLOPs) by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: Selective distillation of reasoning tokens simplifies reasoning distillation, balances computation-quality tradeoffs, and provides an effective approach to reduce resource requirements for student models.

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

### [55] [Rethinking Supervised Fine-Tuning: Emphasizing Key Answer Tokens for Improved LLM Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21017)
*Xiaofeng Shi,Qian Kou,Yuduo Li,Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SFTKey, a two-stage fine-tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs) to balance Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning and focus on the Key portion—the final answer, enhancing accuracy by over 5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often disproportionately focus on lengthy Chain-of-Thought sequences during fine-tuning, neglecting the concise final answer, which critically impacts task performance and evaluation.

Method: The proposed SFTKey involves two stages. First, conventional supervised fine-tuning ensures the output format. Second, fine-tuning targets the essential Key portion (final answer) to boost accuracy.

Result: SFTKey improves average accuracy by over 5% compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches while maintaining proper output formatting across various benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: SFTKey effectively optimizes LLM fine-tuning by balancing CoT learning with enhancement of final answer accuracy, paving the way for better reasoning performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

*Safal Thapaliya,Zehong Wang,Jiazheng Li,Ziming Li,Yanfang Ye,Chuxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DAS, a framework for adapting node semantics in graph learning, combining fixed GNNs and large language models in a feedback loop, enhancing performance across diverse graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of structure-semantics heterogeneity in graph learning, which limits generalization across diverse domains.

Method: Introduces DAS framework, coupling fixed GNNs and large language models in a closed feedback loop for semantic refinement.

Result: Improves performance on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs.

Conclusion: Data-centric semantic adaptation can effectively handle graph heterogeneity, enhancing representation learning.

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

*Eduard Stefan Dinuta,Iustin Sirbu,Traian Rebedea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using semi-supervised learning to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) safety tasks, combining labeled and unlabeled data with task-specific augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the challenges of acquiring large quantities of labeled safety data for training safety classifiers in LLMs without relying heavily on potentially erroneous or synthetic data.

Method: The authors propose employing semi-supervised learning techniques that integrate both labeled and unlabeled data, emphasizing the importance of task-specific augmentations in achieving better outcomes.

Result: Semi-supervised learning, powered by task-specific augmentations, demonstrated significant performance improvements in analyzing both prompts and responses for LLM safety tasks.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning with task-specific augmentation is a promising approach to improve the safety performance of LLMs, reducing dependency on labeled data and enhancing task outcomes.

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

*Sichun Luo,Yi Huang,Mukai Li,Shichang Meng,Fengyuan Liu,Zefa Hu,Junlan Feng,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClarifyMT-Bench introduces a benchmark for assessing multi-turn clarification behavior of LLMs in ambiguous interactions, highlighting consistent biases and proposing an agentic approach (ClarifyAgent) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks fail to address multi-turn clarification in open-domain dialogues, especially when users provide incomplete or ambiguous information.

Method: The authors developed ClarifyMT-Bench, combining a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy, diverse simulated personas, and a hybrid LLM-human pipeline creating 6,120 clarification dialogues. They propose ClarifyAgent, a structured decomposition for improving robustness.

Result: Ten LLMs were evaluated, revealing a bias toward under-clarification and performance degradation in deeper dialogues. ClarifyAgent mitigated these issues, showing improved robustness against ambiguity conditions.

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench provides a reproducible framework for studying LLM clarification strategies in realistic multi-turn interactions, setting the stage for further improvement in handling ambiguity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpidR-Adapt, a model to rapidly adapt to new languages with minimal unlabeled data, significantly improving data efficiency over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human infants efficiently learn new languages from limited exposure, which highlights the inefficiency of current self-supervised speech models requiring large datasets.

Method: The authors propose a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) framework using a bi-level optimization approach and introduce first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO) to reduce computational costs. Robust initialization is achieved via interleaved supervision with both self-supervised and supervised learning.

Result: SpidR-Adapt demonstrates rapid improvements in various speech tasks using less than one hour of target-language audio, achieving over 100× better data efficiency compared to standard training methods.

Conclusion: The findings provide a practical, biologically-inspired, and architecture-agnostic route to data-efficient speech representation learning, bridging the gap between human learning and machine models.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

*Divij Dudeja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in processing Engineering Manuals (EM) using transformers and introduces SMART, a model leveraging hierarchical processing for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to read EMs due to their lengthy and dense format, and current compact transformers handle this inefficiently and inaccurately.

Method: SMART uses a hierarchical approach with three components: a syntax-aware Fact Extractor, a compact indexed MANN, and a 6-layer Transformer for fact fusion.

Result: SMART utilizes fewer parameters than GPT-2 and BERT, achieves 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, and reduces processing inefficiencies.

Conclusion: SMART offers an effective solution to process complex EMs efficiently, with better-supported and accurate results, minimizing hallucinations compared to small transformer models.

Abstract: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

*Felix Draxler,Justus Will,Farrin Marouf Sofian,Theofanis Karaletsos,Sameer Singh,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel Token Prediction (PTP) is a new framework enabling parallel sequence generation in language models by predicting multiple dependent tokens simultaneously, reducing decoding latency without compromising model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the latency bottleneck in autoregressive decoding and to overcome the independence constraints in existing multi-token prediction techniques.

Method: PTP jointly predicts dependent tokens in a single transformer call. It integrates the sampling process into the model and can be trained using model distillation or inverse autoregressive training.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Vicuna-7B is achieved with PTP, allowing the model to predict over four tokens per step in Spec-Bench, demonstrating effective speculative decoding.

Conclusion: PTP demonstrates the possibility of parallel generation for long sequences in language models without sacrificing modeling capability, offering a universal and efficient decoding method.

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

### [62] [Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21329)
*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning benchmarks like ARC conflate perception and reasoning, with performance gaps often due to visual perception limits rather than reasoning failures. The authors propose separating perception from reasoning in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a key challenge in evaluating AI on reasoning tasks such as ARC, questioning whether performance gaps arise from reasoning deficits or perception issues.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage pipeline separating perception (converting images to descriptions) and reasoning (inducing/applying rules on descriptions), applied to three ARC-style datasets.

Result: Comparisons reveal most performance failures (approximately 80%) in existing AI were due to perception errors, not reasoning. A two-stage pipeline showed better isolation and analysis of issues.

Conclusion: Evaluation protocols for reasoning tasks should disentangle perception from reasoning to fairly assess AI progress, as conflating these challenges may mislead interpretations of model deficiencies.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in code embedding, specifically issues in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and enhance performance in code understanding tasks.

Method: Utilizes Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) for sequence embeddings, leveraging pretraining causal representations, aggregating token information, and allowing flexible dimension adaptation.

Result: C2LLM-7B sets records on the MTEB-Code leaderboard, ranking 1st overall compared to similar-sized models.

Abstract: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of decoding order sensitivity in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) and introduces Denoising Entropy to optimize the generative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of variability in output quality in MDMs due to sensitivity in the decoding order.

Method: The authors introduce Denoising Entropy as a metric to quantify predictive uncertainty and propose two entropy-guided algorithms: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy.

Result: Using the proposed methods, they achieve significant improvements in generative quality and accuracy on reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

Conclusion: Denoising Entropy is a valuable tool for evaluating and guiding the generative process, transforming uncertainty in MDMs into an advantage for producing high-quality solutions.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VL4Gaze, a benchmark dataset to evaluate and enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for gaze understanding tasks, showing significant improvements with task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of focus on gaze understanding in existing VLMs, despite its importance for interpreting attention and social interactions in visual scenes.

Method: The researchers create VL4Gaze, a benchmark with 489K question-answer pairs across 124K images. It formulates gaze understanding as a VQA problem involving four tasks: gaze object description, gaze direction, gaze point location, and ambiguous question recognition. Both commercial and open-source VLMs are tested using in-context learning and fine-tuning.

Result: Large-scale VLMs show difficulties in understanding gaze without task-specific supervision. However, training on the VL4Gaze benchmark greatly improves performance on all tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific, multi-task supervision is essential to enhance gaze understanding in VLMs. The release of the dataset and code aims to foster further research in this area.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing efficient and accurate trash detection with limited computational resources for TinyML devices.

Method: Iterative evolutionary search within an architecture called ResDets supernet, leveraging accuracy predictors and hardware optimization techniques.

Result: TrashDet family achieved scalable results on trash detection tasks with parameters ranging from 1.2M to 30.5M. Specialized variants showed marked improvement in accuracy, reduced energy consumption, latency, and power on microcontrollers.

Conclusion: TrashDets framework delivers highly efficient and scalable models for trash detection tailored for resource-constrained TinyML deployment hardware, outperforming existing benchmarks in accuracy and energy efficiency.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OccuFly, a camera-based aerial SSC benchmark for drones, addressing the challenges of semantic scene completion in aerial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic Scene Completion has predominantly focused on ground-level applications, leaving aerial scenarios largely unaddressed despite their importance for UAV operations. Additionally, reliance on LiDAR sensors imposes constraints on UAVs.

Method: A benchmark dataset named OccuFly is created, capturing multi-altitude and seasonal aerial scenes across diverse environments using a LiDAR-free camera-based framework for automating 3D label annotation through 3D reconstruction and 2D mask lifting.

Result: OccuFly provides a robust dataset of aerial SSC, covering 22 semantic classes across varied scenarios. The paper benchmarks existing methods and identifies challenges specific to aerial elevated viewpoint data.

Conclusion: The OccuFly benchmark facilitates advancements in aerial SSC, overcoming LiDAR constraints. It opens pathways for robust UAV-based 3D perception and enhances scene understanding in elevated viewpoints.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

### [68] [NULLBUS: Multimodal Mixed-Supervision for Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Nullable Global-Local Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20783)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NullBUS, a method to improve breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation by handling datasets with incomplete text or spatial prompts. It achieves this through mixed-supervision and nullable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of incomplete metadata in public BUS datasets, which limits the robustness and multimodal training capabilities of current segmentation models.

Method: The authors propose NullBUS, which integrates image and text data into a single model using nullable prompts—a technique employing learnable null embeddings and presence masks to accommodate missing metadata.

Result: NullBUS achieved state-of-the-art segmentation results with a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice score of 0.9103 on three public BUS datasets, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: NullBUS successfully enhances segmentation performance in multimodal datasets with varying prompt availability, proving robust and adaptable for practical applications in breast ultrasound analysis.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for autonomous driving pipelines, optimizing optics, sensors, and segmentation networks into an end-to-end RAW-to-task system for improved perception, especially under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems decouple camera design and downstream perception, leading to a loss of information and forcing adaptation to sensor artifacts. There is a need to unify these components for better efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The framework integrates realistic optical models, learnable color filter arrays, sensor noise processes, and semantic segmentation into a RAW-to-task pipeline optimized directly for segmentation objectives.

Result: The proposed system achieves consistent mIoU improvements in evaluations on KITTI-360, with significant performance gains for challenging classes, using a compact model (~1M parameters) running efficiently at ~28 FPS.

Conclusion: Full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks provides a principled approach for enhancing efficient, robust, and deployable autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHAMMI-75, a dataset of diverse multi-channel microscopy images, aiming to address limitations of single imaging type models in cellular morphology studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, cellular morphology models are limited by being trained on single imaging types, restricting their usability across biological studies with diverse imaging setups and experimental conditions.

Method: The authors created CHAMMI-75, an open dataset of heterogeneous multi-channel microscopy images from 75 biological studies, and utilized it to train channel-adaptive models.

Result: Training with CHAMMI-75 improved performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to the dataset's diversity in microscopy modalities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of CHAMMI-75 to advance cellular morphology models, enabling broader applicability and adaptability in biological research.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automated pollen recognition in optical and DIHM images, overcoming significant challenges in holographic data. Using YOLOv8s and MobileNetV3L, they develop detection and classification models, improving results with GAN-based augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the performance gap in automated pollen recognition between optical microscopy and DIHM images, facilitating advancements in veterinary imaging.

Method: The authors used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset. They implemented WGAN-SN for synthetic data generation to enhance performance on DIHM images.

Result: The models achieve high accuracy in optical microscopy but significantly lower performance in DIHM data. With GAN-based data augmentation, the DIHM image detection accuracy improves to 15.4%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of GAN-based augmentation to improve automated pollen recognition in DIHM images, moving closer to practical applications in veterinary imaging.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive visual preprocessing framework to improve the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs), particularly when working with high-resolution visual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of high inference latency and computational costs in deploying VLMs, which remain suboptimal due to redundant computations on visually simple inputs caused by static visual preprocessing methods.

Method: The paper proposes a dynamic preprocessing method consisting of content-aware image analysis, resolution adjustment, and cropping that adapts input resolution and spatial coverage to the image's content before feeding it to the vision encoder.

Result: The method, integrated with FastVLM without architectural modifications or retraining, showed over 50% reduction in inference time per image, more than 55% reduction in visual token count, and overall gains in efficiency in experiments on a subset of the DocVQA dataset.

Conclusion: Input-aware adaptive preprocessing significantly enhances the efficiency of VLMs without sacrificing performance, making them more suitable for deployment. The implementation is open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

*Md Zabirul Islam,Md Motaleb Hossen Manik,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALIVE, a system enhancing lecture videos with interactive, real-time queries and avatar-delivered explanations entirely on local hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lecture videos lack real-time interaction and require external efforts for clarifications. Current AI solutions for interactive learning often miss contextual lecture integration or rely on privacy-invasive, cloud-based methods.

Method: The authors develop ALIVE, a local-hardware-based system combining ASR transcription, LLM-originated refinements, and neural avatars for interactive lectures. It includes content-aware retrieval and allows real-time question-and-answer sessions.

Result: The system was successfully tested in a medical imaging course, demonstrating retrieval accuracy, low latency, and positive user experiences.

Conclusion: ALIVE showcases how multimodal AI and content-aware features can improve recorded lecture engagement and pave the way for next-gen interactive learning tools.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced intelligence detection framework for underground pipelines using 3D GPR technology, addressing weak feature correlation, low accuracy, and insufficient robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve pipeline detection accuracy and robustness in complex environments, especially for small-scale targets, using 3D GPR technologies.

Method: Introduced a three-view analysis strategy for feature evaluation with simulation and measurement validation. Proposed the DCO-YOLO framework for feature extraction. Developed the 3D-DIoU algorithm for spatial feature matching and multi-view annotation fusion.

Result: Achieved high performance metrics (accuracy: 96.2%, recall: 93.3%, mAP: 96.7%) in complex pipeline scenarios. Ablation experiments and heatmap visualization confirm improved detection capabilities.

Conclusion: The study presents a reliable framework combining deep learning and physical principles of 3D GPR for intelligent pipeline detection and localization with improved precision.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeRV360, an end-to-end framework for efficient video decoding of 360-degree videos, achieving significant memory and speed improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of existing implicit neural representation methods like NeRV when applied to high-resolution 360-degree videos, particularly the high memory consumption and slow decoding speed, which hinder real-time applications.

Method: The proposed method, NeRV360, integrates viewport extraction into the decoding process and leverages a spatial-temporal affine transform module to conditionally decode based on user-selected viewpoint and time.

Result: NeRV360 reduces memory consumption by 7 times and increases decoding speed by 2.5 times compared to HNeRV, while improving image quality as measured by objective metrics.

Conclusion: NeRV360 demonstrates that integrating conditional decoding and viewport extraction can significantly enhance the performance of 360-degree video compression systems, making them more practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, Domain Representation Injection (DRI), to address modality gaps in Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification using frozen Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and minimal trainable parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by significant modality discrepancies in CMS Re-ID, especially the reliance of existing solutions on large-scale paired datasets for pre-training.

Method: The approach involves leveraging VFMs with a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). This method keeps VFMs frozen and utilizes an Offset Encoder and a Modulator to extract and inject domain-specific representations into intermediate feature layers without altering pre-trained weights.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance with minimal trainable parameters, as evidenced by 57.9% and 60.5% mAP scores on the HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters respectively.

Conclusion: Domain Representation Injection (DRI) provides an effective and efficient solution for bridging modality gaps in CMS Re-ID, utilizing VFMs and minimizing trainable parameters while outperforming existing methods with state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing multimodal and multi-temporal fusion methods, which are inefficient and unable to effectively integrate information for diagnosing pulmonary nodules.

Method: The authors propose a method involving: 1. A Global-Local Feature Encoder to capture local, global, and fused characteristics. 2. A Dual-Graph Construction method to organize multimodal features as inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. 3. A Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module for feature integration.

Result: The proposed methodology, implemented as DGSAN, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules. The results are validated on the newly compiled NLST-cmst dataset and curated CSTL-derived datasets with high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DGSAN is a significant advancement in the early detection of pulmonary nodules, providing exceptional performance in multimodal information integration and computational efficiency. The study also introduces a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capability of VLMs in handling low-bitrate compressed images and improve their efficiency and performance in real-world applications.

Method: They developed a comprehensive benchmark with over one million compressed images, compared performance gaps due to compression and generalization issues, and proposed a universal adaptor for better VLM performance on compressed images.

Result: The universal adaptor improved VLM performance by 10%-30% across various image codecs and compression levels, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between VLMs and compressed images, providing a benchmark and an enhancement method for better handling of low-quality inputs.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

TL;DR: The paper presents PanoGrounder, a framework for 3D visual grounding that uses panoramic representations and pretrained 2D vision-language models for improved reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the limitations of traditional supervised 3D visual grounding models in generalization due to insufficient datasets and weaker reasoning abilities compared to modern vision-language models.

Method: The authors introduce a three-stage pipeline using panoramic renderings as an intermediate representation to bridge 2D and 3D spaces. This approach includes placing panoramic viewpoints, grounding queries using vision-language models, and fusing predictions into 3D bounding boxes.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets and excels in generalization to unseen datasets and text rephrasings.

Conclusion: PanoGrounder highlights the effectiveness of combining 360-degree panoramic representations and pretrained vision-language models, offering a significant advancement in 3D visual grounding.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMC-Mamba, a novel framework for general image fusion enhancing data integration across modalities and boosting downstream tasks like detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques in image fusion often address specific tasks but struggle to encompass diverse applications while maintaining efficiency.

Method: The SMC-Mamba framework uses a MAFE module for modality-agnostic feature enhancement, MCCM module for dynamic collaboration, and a self-supervised contrastive loss technique to ensure high performance and low computational overhead.

Result: SMC-Mamba surpasses SOTA methods in various fusion tasks and optimizes performance in downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: SMC-Mamba achieves high-quality image fusion across modalities, proving effective for various applications while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.

Abstract: Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-Render and GS-Net framework improves open-vocabulary 3D segmentation in terms of quality and efficiency, paving the way for real-time applications. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

### [82] [Transductive Visual Programming: Evolving Tool Libraries from Experience for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20934)
*Shengguang Wu,Xiaohan Wang,Yuhui Zhang,Hao Zhu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), which evolves tools from experience to improve spatial reasoning in 3D tasks, setting a new performance benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for spatial reasoning in vision-language models rely on either fixed tools or speculative tool creation, leading to inefficiencies and poor tool utilization.

Method: The TVP framework first solves problems with basic tools, storing solutions in an Example Library. Recurring patterns are then abstracted to create reusable, higher-level tools for a Tool Library.

Result: TVP achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and prior systems by 11% on Omni3D-Bench. Its learned tools demonstrate 5x more usage and better generalization in new tasks.

Conclusion: TVP establishes a robust framework for experience-driven tool innovation, marking significant progress in visual programming agents for complex spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/.

### [83] [Reasoning-Driven Amodal Completion: Collaborative Agents and Perceptual Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20936)
*Hongxing Fan,Shuyu Zhao,Jiayang Ao,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework for amodal completion to tackle issues in maintaining semantic and structural consistency. This method incorporates semantic planning and a novel evaluation metric, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in amodal completion, such as inference instability, error accumulation, and difficulty in achieving semantically coherent and structurally consistent results.

Method: The proposed framework separates Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis and introduces mechanisms like a Verification Agent for self-correction and a Diverse Hypothesis Generator for handling unseen regions' ambiguity. It also proposes the MAC-Score for evaluating inferred content.

Result: Experimental findings show that the framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of semantic and structural performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework and MAC-Score set a new benchmark for amodal completion, improving both evaluation standards and prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

### [84] [Beyond Artifacts: Real-Centric Envelope Modeling for Reliable AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20937)
*Ruiqi Liu,Yi Han,Zhengbo Zhang,Liwei Yao,Zhiyuan Yan,Jialiang Shen,ZhiJin Chen,Boyi Sun,Lubin Weng,Jing Dong,Yan Wang,Shu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a detection paradigm that focuses on modeling the distribution of real images instead of generator-specific artifacts. It achieves superior performance in detecting synthetic images, even under real-world degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detection mechanisms has become critical due to the advancements in generative models and the challenges posed by evolving architectures and real-world degradations during image sharing and post-processing.

Method: The authors introduced REM, which uses feature-level perturbations during self-reconstruction to mimic near-real samples and an envelope estimator to model the boundary of the real image manifold. Additionally, they developed RealChain, a benchmark for testing detection under real-world conditions.

Result: REM outperformed state-of-the-art detection methods, achieving a 7.5% average improvement across benchmarks while demonstrating strong generalization under severely degraded conditions in the RealChain benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed REM paradigm establishes a strong basis for detecting synthetic images in real-world scenarios, addressing limitations of current methods regarding generator-specific artifacts and artifact degradation.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPOT introduces a map-guided agent to track vehicles across blind spots in multi-CCTV setups, ensuring trajectory continuity without needing prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CCTV vehicle tracking systems suffer from trajectory loss and ID switching due to blind spots caused by limited camera coverage and placement gaps, hindering real-time path predictions.

Method: SPOT leverages map-guided LLMs, encoding road structures and CCTV placement as chunked spatial documents combined with vehicle position transformations and inference strategies like beam search for predicting vehicle movements.

Result: Experiments using the CARLA simulator showed SPOT effectively predicts next CCTV locations across blind spots, outperforming traditional trajectory maintenance techniques.

Conclusion: SPOT enhances CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems by addressing blind spots with spatial-coordinate-informed predictions, improving reliability without prior system training.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

*Zeqing Song,Zhongmiao Yan,Junyuan Deng,Songpengcheng Xia,Xiang Mu,Jingyi Xu,Qi Wu,Ling Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces XGrid-Mapping, a new framework for efficient neural LiDAR mapping utilizing hybrid explicit and implicit representations for large-scale incremental mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current neural LiDAR mapping methods, such as inefficiency in real-time mapping and underutilization of geometric structure, by combining sparse and dense representations.

Method: XGrid-Mapping employs a hybrid grid approach combining sparse grids for geometric priors with implicit dense grids for detailed scene representation, reduced computational load using VDB structure and submap-based organization, and overlap alignment for consistency.

Result: XGrid-Mapping demonstrated superior mapping quality and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in large-scale mapping tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances neural LiDAR mapping by combining explicit and implicit representations, improving mapping quality and efficiency for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

TL;DR: This paper addresses diagnostic challenges of rare pulmonary anomalies in chest X-rays by proposing a data synthesis pipeline that augments tail lesion examples, enhancing rare lesion representation and diagnostic precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve diagnostic precision in chest radiography by addressing the issue of insufficient representation of rare pulmonary anomalies (tail lesions).

Method: The method involves training a diffusion model using normal X-rays to generate synthetic normal images, followed by fine-tuned inpainting to replace head lesions and augment tail classes. Additionally, it incorporates Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) and Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL).

Result: Experiments on public datasets (MIMIC and CheXpert) show the proposed approach achieves superior performance benchmarks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The novel pipeline substantially enhances rare lesion representation and diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating its potential to address long-tailed challenges in medical imaging.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating accurate and dense point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial data, aiming to improve visual fidelity and consistency for surface reconstructions.

Method: Propose PUFM++ with a two-stage flow-matching strategy, adaptive time scheduler for accelerated inference, on-manifold constraints for surface alignment, and a recurrent interface network for better hierarchical feature interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show PUFM++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud upsampling with superior visual and quantitative accuracy.

Conclusion: PUFM++ enhances point cloud upsampling across several metrics, solidifying its state-of-the-art status and offering valuable tools for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

*Xiangzuo Wu,Chengwei Ren,Jun Zhou,Xiu Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for multi-view inverse rendering that improves consistency, efficiency, and generalization through a feed-forward approach and a novel finetuning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-view inverse rendering either neglect cross-view relationships or rely on computationally intensive optimization processes, limiting their consistency and scalability.

Method: The method uses a feed-forward model with alternating attention to predict materials, normals, and lighting interactions, combined with a finetuning strategy leveraging unlabeled real-world videos to improve generalization.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, excelling in consistency, material/normal estimation, and generalization to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient and coherent multi-view inverse rendering solution that addresses prior limitations, enhancing scalability and robustness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in visual generative pretraining, such as poor semantic localization and inadequate generation quality, especially for video analysis.

Method: Proposes NExT-Vid with masked next-frame prediction, a context-isolated autoregressive predictor for semantic decoupling, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder for enhanced generation.

Result: Experiments confirm that NExT-Vid delivers better visual representation learning and classification performance compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully resolves semantic and quality issues in visual generative pretraining while improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models overfit with limited data and are sensitive to distribution shifts. Existing data augmentation techniques lack structural awareness and may discard crucial semantics.

Method: The authors propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), using Granular-ball Computing for hierarchical masking that preserves semantically rich regions while removing redundant ones.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks show consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, demonstrating the method's wide applicability.

Conclusion: GBGM is simple, model-agnostic, and integrates well with CNNs and Vision Transformers, offering a structure-aware augmentation paradigm to enhance deep learning effectiveness.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing models adapted from text-to-image models often struggle with temporal consistency and high computational complexity.

Method: FluencyVE replaces the temporal attention layer with a linear time-series module (Mamba), integrates low-rank approximation matrices for efficiency, and employs attention score weighting during training.

Result: The approach achieved successful editing of attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos, maintaining generative power while lowering computational burden.

Conclusion: FluencyVE demonstrates a simple yet effective method for video editing, addressing temporal inconsistency and computational efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the privacy risks posed by advanced 3D-field TFG techniques, for which no efficient video defense mechanism currently exists.

Method: The proposed framework perturbs the 3D information acquisition process using (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module for spatial-frequency optimization.

Result: The framework achieves a 47x speed improvement over the fastest baseline while maintaining video quality, demonstrating robust defense capabilities even against scaling and purification attacks.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel, efficient, and robust method to protect portrait videos from misuse by TFG technologies, verified through extensive evaluations and ablation studies.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

TL;DR: This paper addresses performance issues in infrared face recognition by introducing a novel latent diffusion-based model that converts thermal face images to visible light images, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome domain shifts and limitations in infrared face recognition due to traditional training on visible datasets and challenges with existing conversion techniques.

Method: A latent diffusion-based model is developed, integrating a multi-attribute classifier for preserving features during infrared-to-visible conversion, supported by a Self-attn Mamba module for improved cross-modal feature modeling and inference speed.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality and identity preservation, as demonstrated on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the performance gap in HFR, offering a robust solution for generating high-quality visible images from infrared inputs while preserving identity features.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised approach for image denoising that resolves the tension between noise decorrelation and detail preservation by constructing cross-scale training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised image denoising struggles to balance effective noise removal with preserving high-frequency details, and existing blind-spot methods face trade-offs due to their noise decorrelation techniques.

Method: The proposed NSP method uses low-resolution sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets, thus separating noise removal from detail preservation. It naturally enables super-resolution of noisy images.

Result: NSP outperforms existing methods on real-world benchmarks, offering state-of-the-art denoising performance while balancing noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: NSP delivers a novel solution to the long-standing problem in self-supervised denoising, providing effective noise decorrelation without compromising image details, and integrates super-resolution capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: KOREATECH-CGH is a valuable resource for advancing ML-CGH, and its proposed amplitude projection technique is effective in improving hologram reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

*Zhijie Wang,Liangtian He,Qinghua Zhang,Jifei Miao,Liang-Jian Deng,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel reweighted logarithmic norm to better solve low-rank matrix completion problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods using alternate direction method solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank matrix completion struggles due to its NP-hard nature, and common methods using nuclear norms often produce suboptimal results due to excessive shrinkage of singular values.

Method: The paper introduces a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a nonconvex surrogate for the rank function and solves the associated optimization using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Result: Experimental results confirm the proposed approach delivers superior image inpainting performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LRMC methods, evaluated both visually and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The reweighted logarithmic norm offers an effective solution for low-rank matrix completion, advancing image inpainting results and outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 6DoF object pose tracking method leveraging an event camera, addressing challenges faced by traditional cameras like motion blur and changing lighting conditions, with superior accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of motion blur, sensor noise, occlusion, and changing lighting conditions in object pose tracking with traditional cameras by utilizing the advantages of bio-inspired event cameras.

Method: A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is developed for corners and edges detection. Optical flow of corners is searched by maximizing event probability within a spatio-temporal window, establishing the correlation between corners and edges. Pose is iteratively optimized using a distance-minimization approach.

Result: Experimental tests, on both simulated and real events, confirm that the proposed method performs better than current state-of-the-art event-based methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively utilizes event cameras' properties to overcome traditional tracking challenges, delivering a superior method for precise and robust 6DoF object pose tracking.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework, DexAvatar, to accurately reconstruct hand and body movements from sign language videos, addressing the lack of accurate 3D pose data and limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the shortcomings in current sign language datasets, which lack precise 3D human pose information, and the limitations of existing 3D pose estimation methods due to challenges like occlusion, noise, and motion blur.

Method: The approach introduces DexAvatar, a data-driven framework that reconstructs biomechanically accurate 3D hand articulation and body movements from monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D priors.

Result: DexAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 35.11% improvement in body and hand pose estimation on the SGNify motion capture dataset.

Conclusion: DexAvatar offers a significant advancement in sign language generation by improving the accuracy of 3D hand and body reconstructions, providing a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniPath, a controllable pathology image generation framework leveraging advanced understanding models, addressing semantic control issues and data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In computational pathology, generative models lack fine-grained semantic control and rely on limited high-quality data. The paper aims to bridge the gap by enabling precise, semantic-driven image generation.

Method: UniPath integrates Multi-Stream Control using raw text, high-level semantic tokens derived from pathology models, and prototype banks for morphological control. It also curates large datasets for better training.

Result: UniPath achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior metrics such as Patho-FID of 80.9 and realistic semantic control at 98.7%, thanks to advanced generation techniques and curated datasets.

Conclusion: UniPath successfully addresses key challenges in pathology image generation, offering precise semantic control and high-quality datasets. The tools developed are publicly accessible to advance the field.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework called Decomposition and Composition for efficient and effective multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency and suboptimal performance in existing multimodal fusion methods for human action understanding.

Method: A self-supervised framework leveraging decomposition (separating multimodal features into unimodal counterparts) and composition (using unimodal features to enhance multimodal learning).

Result: Experiments show improved balance between computational efficiency and performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively uses multimodal complementarity while maintaining model efficiency, addressing the key challenge in multimodal human action understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional VPR methods that rely on single-image retrieval and lack generalization in diverse environments, by exploring multi-view integration.

Method: The method involves adapting a VGGT backbone for VPR, designing feature aggregators, and creating descriptors that combine 2D and 3D tokens with dedicated aggregation modules. It also includes both single- and multi-frame aggregation, and a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy.

Result: UniPR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both single- and multi-view baselines and demonstrating the effectiveness of using geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

Conclusion: UniPR-3D effectively integrates multi-view 3D representations for VPR, enhancing both generalization and performance. The approach is publicly accessible, promoting further research.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in extracting knowledge from documents, particularly improving table recognition methods which are slow and not fully explained in existing approaches.

Method: Introduced a multi-task model with non-causal attention for understanding table structures and a parallel inference algorithm for faster recognition.

Result: The approach outperformed existing methods both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: Combining non-causal attention and parallel inference enhances table recognition efficiency and quality.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation tools and methodologies for assessing T2AV systems, especially regarding cross-modal synchronization, perceptual realism, and semantic alignment.

Method: The authors developed T2AV-Compass, a 500-prompt benchmark that uses a taxonomy-driven pipeline for diversity and physical plausibility, along with an evaluation framework combining signal-level metrics and subjective judgment via MLLM protocols.

Result: Evaluation of 11 T2AV systems shows that current models perform poorly in achieving human-level realism, fine-grained synchronization, and accurate instruction-following, demonstrating significant deficiencies.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass provides an essential framework for identifying weaknesses and guiding improvements in T2AV models, setting a difficulty standard for future advancements.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniRec-0.1B, a lightweight model for unified text and formula recognition with only 0.1B parameters, offering improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust and efficient document parsing systems that unify text and formula recognition without the heavy computational demands of vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: The method involves creating UniRec40M, a dataset with 40 million samples, hierarchical supervision training for structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer to disentangle text and formula semantics.

Result: UniRec-0.1B achieves superior performance compared to general-purpose VLMs and specialized models, along with a 2–9× speedup in processing efficiency.

Conclusion: UniRec-0.1B effectively combines lightweight structure with enhanced accuracy and speed, resolving challenges in hierarchical variability and semantic entanglement in document parsing.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to balance prompt alignment and visual fidelity in text-guided image inpainting.

Method: FreeInpaint utilizes prior-guided noise optimization to focus on valid regions and employs composite guidance objectives to refine prompt alignment and visual rationality.

Result: Through experiments with diverse models and metrics, FreeInpaint showed improved performance and robustness in text-guided image inpainting.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint enhances text-guided image inpainting by optimizing diffusion latents dynamically, offering superior prompt alignment and visual fidelity without tuning.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether current VLMs can act as domain experts by evaluating their performance in accurately answering marine domain-specific questions.

Method: The authors create MarineEval, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for marine-related tasks, comprising 2,000 image-based Q&A pairs. They ensure data diversity across 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions, verified by marine domain experts.

Result: The study benchmarks 17 VLMs on MarineEval. Results indicate that VLMs fail to effectively answer marine-specific questions, uncovering significant limitations.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are unable to meet the specialized requirements of marine domain inquiries, highlighting the need for focused improvements in domain-specific vision-language modeling.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided medical segmentation approaches struggle with issues such as inadequate fine-grained anatomical detail preservation, limited modeling of medical text, and domain-specific semantic misalignment, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors introduced TGC-Net with three core components: a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) for structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) for medical knowledge injection, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) for refining cross-modal features in a unified space.

Result: TGC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five chest X-ray and thoracic CT datasets, achieving significant Dice score improvements while using fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TGC-Net successfully advances text-guided medical segmentation by leveraging efficient CLIP-style multimodal adaption and task-specific innovations, showcasing its applicability and efficiency in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: http://orca.hkustvgd.com/.

### [110] [A Turn Toward Better Alignment: Few-Shot Generative Adaptation with Equivariant Feature Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21174)
*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR) for few-shot image generation, addressing domain adaptation challenges with a novel approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve few-shot image generation by overcoming limitations in existing methods that struggle with distribution alignment between source and target domains, especially with limited target samples.

Method: Developed Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), which uses adaptive rotations in a parameterized Lie Group to align source and target domains in a proxy feature space, preserving intra-domain structures and enabling better knowledge transfer.

Result: EFR significantly enhances generative performance in the target domain, as shown by experiments on various datasets.

Conclusion: EFR offers an effective alignment strategy that mitigates domain gap issues, advancing few-shot image generation performance.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NAME, a novel framework to continuously represent and interpolate/extrapolate human motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates, improving temporal coherence using hierarchical implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for smoother and temporally coherent representations of physical human motion, leveraging continuous, mathematically-driven methodologies.

Method: NAME employs hierarchical temporal encoding paired with a custom parametric activation function, built using Fourier transformations, within an implicit neural representation framework to capture and represent intricate motion dynamics.

Result: Experimental results show that NAME significantly improves accuracy and robustness in representing complex motion patterns, validated on multiple benchmark motion datasets.

Conclusion: NAME successfully enables continuous representation of human motions across arbitrary frame rates, offering smoothness, temporal coherence, and high accuracy, confirmed via extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraShape 1.0 introduces a scalable framework for highly detailed 3D geometry generation, improving data quality and refining geometric details using a structured diffusion pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-quality 3D geometries with consistency and scalability, especially given limitations of public datasets.

Method: UltraShape 1.0 uses a two-stage pipeline: initial coarse structure synthesis followed by voxel-based spatial refinement for detailed geometry. A data preprocessing approach improves publicly available datasets through methods like watertight processing and filtering.

Result: UltraShape 1.0 achieves competitive results in geometry quality and data processing compared to existing methods, despite limited training resources.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves 3D geometry fidelity and data quality, supports future advancements, and opens research possibilities by releasing code and models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisRes Bench, a benchmark for studying visual reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), showing limitations in perceptual and relational reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether vision-language models (VLMs) perform genuine visual reasoning or rely on linguistic priors, and to address gaps in benchmarking their abstract visual reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors created VisRes Bench with three levels of complexity to analyze distinct reasoning abilities: perceptual completion (Level 1), rule-based inference (Level 2), and compositional reasoning (Level 3). They tested over 19,000 controlled images with perturbations across different tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs showed near-random performance under perceptual perturbations, indicating limited abilities in abstract reasoning beyond pattern recognition.

Conclusion: VisRes Bench offers a comprehensive framework to enhance abstract visual reasoning capabilities in multimodal research by revealing the gaps in current VLM performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

*Siqi Zhu,Yixuan Li,Junfu Li,Qi Wu,Zan Wang,Haozhe Ma,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EveryWear introduces a full-body motion capture system using everyday wearables like smartphones and smartwatches, with no explicit calibration needed. A new dataset, Ego-Elec, supports its robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion estimation methods for on-body devices are hindered by poor wearability, high costs, and complex calibration, limiting real-world adaptability.

Method: EveryWear leverages everyday wearables in a multimodal teacher-student framework to integrate visual data from egocentric cameras and inertial signals from devices. It trains on real-world data using the new Ego-Elec dataset.

Result: EveryWear's model outperforms baseline systems in full-body motion estimation, demonstrating practical usability and robustness.

Conclusion: By overcoming prior challenges and using widely available devices, EveryWear offers an accessible and effective solution for daily-life motion tracking.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

*Kelvin Li,Chuyi Shang,Leonid Karlinsky,Rogerio Feris,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a task-agnostic approach for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance visual reasoning abilities using unsupervised visual tokens instead of manual intermediate visual steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs struggle with tasks requiring predominantly visual reasoning, as they rely heavily on text-centric approaches. Existing solutions impose restrictive priors and incur high annotation costs.

Method: The authors introduce visual reasoning tokens that globally attend and adaptively re-encode visual information from images, allowing LMMs to extract task-relevant data without explicit supervision.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse vision-centric tasks, surpassing direct fine-tuning and demonstrating strong generalization in multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The task-agnostic mechanism effectively enables LMMs to handle visual reasoning tasks more efficiently, eliminating the need for hand-crafted supervision and broadening the applicability of these models.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in real-world image-text retrieval, including vague queries, linguistic variations, and scalability.

Method: They propose a two-stage pipeline: the first stage utilizes BM25 for candidate filtering based on salient entities, and the second stage employs BEiT-3 models for multimodal semantic analysis and reranking.

Result: Their method achieved a mean average precision of 0.559 on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, outperforming prior baselines.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with deep vision-language modeling for improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

*Bowen Dang,Lin Wu,Xiaohang Yang,Zheng Yuan,Zhixiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SegMo, a novel framework for generating human motions from textual descriptions using fine-grained segment-based alignment of text and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the problem of generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions, noting that current methods fail to utilize finer-grained alignments between textual and motion modalities.

Method: SegMo's framework consists of three main modules: Text Segment Extraction, Motion Segment Extraction, and Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment using contrastive learning.

Result: SegMo achieves improved performance compared to baseline approaches, with a higher TOP 1 score (0.553) on the HumanML3D test set, and extends its application to motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: SegMo demonstrates that incorporating segment-level alignments improves the generation of human motions from text descriptions, with potential for broader applications in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DreaMontage, a framework for generating one-shot videos from diverse inputs in a seamless, expressive, and coherent manner, addressing prior limitations in temporal coherence and visual smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of creating one-shot videos in filmmaking, which are hindered by high costs and technical constraints, and to improve upon limitations in video generation models that fail to maintain visual coherence and smooth transitions.

Method: The proposed framework (DreaMontage) integrates an intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture, introduces adaptive tuning for robust frame control, uses a Visual Expression SFT stage to improve cinematic quality, applies a Tailored DPO scheme for smoother transitions, and designs a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy for long sequence generation.

Result: The framework successfully generates visually expressive, seamless, and computationally efficient one-shot videos, addressing challenges such as motion rationality and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: DreaMontage provides a robust solution for producing one-shot videos, enabling the creation of high-quality, cohesive cinematic experiences from fragmented inputs.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for robust brain MRI anomaly detection under arbitrary MRI modality availability, using a dual-pathway encoder and feature distribution alignment mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges such as scarcity of annotated abnormal cases, absence of key imaging modalities, and inability of existing models to generalize to unseen modality combinations.

Method: The method includes integrating a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder, feature distribution alignment for incomplete-modality features, and an INP-guided decoder. Randomized modality masking helps adapt the model to various modality configurations without re-training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines across 7 modality combinations on datasets: BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks.

Conclusion: The study establishes a scalable and generalizable paradigm for multimodal medical anomaly detection under real-world imperfect modality conditions, and the code is available online.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD) method for improving controllability in video synthesis by aligning attention maps with external control signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited controllability in existing video synthesis methods, which either model conditions indirectly or struggle with adversarial artifacts and poor alignment with specified conditions.

Method: The authors introduce ACD, which utilizes attention supervision for direct conditional control, sparse 3D-aware object layouts as conditioning signals, a Layout ControlNet, and an automated annotation pipeline.

Result: ACD achieves superior alignment with given conditions while maintaining temporal coherence and visual fidelity in video generation.

Conclusion: ACD establishes a new and effective framework for conditional video synthesis, solving issues of limited control in existing methods.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

*Snehal Singh Tomar,Alexandros Graikos,Arjun Krishna,Dimitris Samaras,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for image sequence generation by factorizing the process into low-resolution sequence generation and high-resolution frame refinement, achieving superior synthesis quality, coherence, efficiency, and generalization compared to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods prompted the need for a more effective modeling approach than treating sequential images as large stacked tensors.

Method: The method involves training a generative model to create sequences at low resolution using Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for inter-frame correlation, followed by super-resolving individual frames to add high-resolution details.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior quality in sequence synthesis, enhanced coherence across frames, faster inference time, efficient data usage, and generalization across diverse domains, outperforming existing SoTA methods.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a straightforward and effective modeling strategy for image sequences that addresses limitations of current methods, achieving high-quality results, and offers efficiency and generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a highly efficient spike-driven video Transformer framework, SpikeSurgSeg, which enables real-time surgical scene segmentation on non-GPU platforms while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time and resource-efficient surgical scene segmentation for enhanced intra-operative safety in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The study proposes a spike-driven video Transformer architecture with a pretraining strategy using surgical-scene masked autoencoding and a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head for efficient spatiotemporal representation learning and prediction.

Result: SpikeSurgSeg achieves comparable accuracy (mIoU) to state-of-the-art ANN-based models with significantly reduced inference latency (8× lower) and acceleration (20× faster) compared to foundation models.

Conclusion: SpikeSurgSeg offers a promising approach for achieving real-time surgical scene segmentation with high efficiency, addressing computational and power constraints in surgical systems.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-scale signal-processing approach to improve table edge detection in noisy and low-resolution images, enhancing cell segmentation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of table rows and columns in noisy or degraded document images is challenging, limiting the effectiveness of existing transformer-based and mask-based edge detection methods.

Method: The proposed method models table boundaries as 1D signals, applies Gaussian convolution with increasing variances, and uses statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving edges for accurate boundary mapping.

Result: Experimental validation showed improvement in CASA accuracy from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark for column edge detection with TableNet and PyTesseract OCR.

Conclusion: The approach improves robustness to resolution variations and outputs optimized tabular data suitable for downstream analysis.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for GUI agents are limited to a narrow set of applications and tasks with basic evaluation metrics, which do not represent real-world complexity.

Method: AndroidLens is created with 571 tasks representing real-world user scenarios, using multi-language support (Chinese and English), static evaluations with multiple valid solution paths, and dynamic milestone-based metrics like Average Task Progress (ATP).

Result: The evaluation shows a significant performance gap, as the best models achieved only a 12.7% success rate for tasks and 50.47% ATP.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges for GUI agents in handling real-world complexities, advocating the need for improvement in areas like adaptive exploration and memory retention.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

TL;DR: TICON is a transformer model to improve contextual tile embeddings in computational pathology, demonstrating superior performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in computational pathology, where traditional pipelines struggle to model crucial slide-level context and cannot generalize embeddings across different tasks.

Method: TICON uses a single shared encoder, pretrained via a masked modeling objective, to unify and contextually enhance embeddings from diverse tile-level foundation models.

Result: TICON achieved state-of-the-art results on both tile-level and slide-level benchmarks and enables high-performance on smaller training datasets compared to existing models.

Conclusion: TICON provides a unified, context-aware embedding approach that surpasses traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency, setting a new direction for computational pathology applications.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for improving the efficiency of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) through selective token pruning in video segmentation tasks, enabling faster and more resource-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the high computational and memory costs associated with SAM2's dense visual token processing, which limits its practical deployment in real-time video segmentation tasks.

Method: The proposed method introduces a text-guided token pruning framework that ranks and selectively reduces token density post-visual encoding, by incorporating local visual context, semantic relevance from textual descriptions, and uncertainty cues, without altering the core segmentation architecture.

Result: The framework achieves up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage compared to the baseline SAM2, while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy in terms of J and F scores.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that early token pruning is a practical and effective solution to enhance the efficiency and scalability of transformer-based video segmentation models, making them more suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Result: Streamo demonstrates strong temporal reasoning, interactive capabilities, and generalization across various streaming benchmarks.

Conclusion: Streamo bridges offline video perception models with real-time multimodal assistants, advancing intelligent video understanding for continuous streams.

Abstract: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

*Li-Zhong Szu-Tu,Ting-Lin Wu,Chia-Jui Chang,He Syu,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show a significant performance bias towards famous buildings, favoring memorization over reasoning, as shown by the newly introduced YearGuessr dataset. The study reveals critical limitations in the generalization capabilities of VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal and address the popularity bias present in VLMs, which hampers their ability to generalize and reason about less recognized or ordinary items.

Method: The authors created the YearGuessr dataset, consisting of 55,546 building images annotated with construction years, GPS data, and popularity indicators. They framed the task as ordinal regression and devised popularity-aware metrics to benchmark performance and assess bias.

Result: Their evaluation of over 30 models, including YearCLIP, showed VLMs perform well on famous buildings but poorly on unrecognized ones, highlighting a critical reasoning flaw.

Conclusion: Despite achieving high accuracy on popular items, VLMs fail to generalize effectively to less familiar data, exposing inherent biases that need to be addressed for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiStream, a framework that addresses the computational inefficiency of diffusion models in generating high-resolution videos, achieving significant speed-ups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome computational challenges in high-resolution video generation caused by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models.

Method: HiStream employs three compression strategies: spatial (denoising at low resolution and refining with cached features), temporal (chunk-based inference with fixed-size anchor cache), and timestep (reduced denoising steps using cached information).

Result: HiStream achieves up to a 107.5x acceleration in denoising speed compared to the baseline model while maintaining state-of-the-art visual quality. The HiStream+ variant further balances speed and quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: HiStream makes high-resolution video generation practical and scalable, addressing prior inefficiencies and offering significant improvements in performance.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

TL;DR: The paper presents RHAPSODY, a middleware enabling hybrid AI-HPC workflows by coordinating runtimes, evaluated with minimal overhead and scaling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address heterogeneous and conflicting requirements in hybrid AI-HPC workflows that current runtime systems cannot fully support, especially for scalable and emerging AI-HPC applications.

Method: The authors propose RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that utilizes uniform abstractions and coordinates multiple runtimes without replacing them. They conducted experiments to evaluate its performance on representative AI-HPC workflows.

Result: RHAPSODY shows minimal runtime overhead while scaling efficiently, achieving near-linear scaling in inference workloads and effective coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agent-driven workflows.

Conclusion: RHAPSODY successfully addresses the challenges posed by hybrid AI-HPC workflows, enabling scalable, efficient, and low-overhead execution across heterogeneous workloads.

Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces stochastic well-structured transition systems (SWSTSs) incorporating probabilistic rules and characterizes their computational capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend well-structured transition systems to capture probabilistic elements and analyze their computational capabilities, particularly in population protocols and similar models.

Method: The authors define stochastic well-structured transition systems with probabilistic scheduling and analyze their performance, including terminated computations, phase clocks, and computational class associations.

Result: SWSTSs with certain augmentations compute languages in BPP, while unaugmented systems compute symmetric languages in BPL. Phase clocks and termination are limited by polynomial steps.

Conclusion: SWSTSs broaden the scope of well-structured transition systems and provide insights into their computational expressiveness, equating augmented systems to BPP and unaugmented to BPL in computational power.

Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoHet, a system optimizing distributed training for large language models across heterogeneous GPUs, demonstrating significant performance speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and optimal distributed training on diverse GPU resources due to the rise of large language models and heterogeneity in GPU environments.

Method: A novel system, AutoHet, is proposed, which uses theoretical optimization models for load balancing and introduces strategies for efficient recovery during training interruptions.

Result: AutoHet showed significant speedups, 1.79× faster training throughput, and 4.38× faster recovery than previous systems using heterogeneous GPU setups.

Conclusion: AutoHet achieves optimal parallelism for LLM training in heterogeneous environments, outperforming alternatives in both efficiency and recovery speed.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

*Linggao Kong,Yuedong Xu,Lei Jiao,Chuan Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of cost-efficient fine-tuning of large foundation models using a mix of GPU spot and on-demand instances, leveraging prediction-driven scheduling algorithms to improve scheduling and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large foundation models is increasingly expensive, and GPU spot instances, while cheaper, have volatile prices and availability. There's a need for cost-efficient, deadline-aware scheduling in such dynamic environments.

Method: An integer programming model was formulated to handle mixed spot and on-demand instance usage. The authors proposed a prediction-based online allocation algorithm leveraging market predictability, and an alternative prediction-free online algorithm for scenarios with inaccurate predictions. They developed a policy selection framework to choose the best algorithm dynamically based on varying conditions.

Result: The prediction-based algorithm achieved better performance with reduced prediction errors, and the policy selection algorithm adapts effectively, achieving a regret bound of O(√T). Experiments showed improvements in utility by up to 54.8% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed online framework demonstrates robust adaptability and efficiency in handling dynamic spot instance markets and prediction quality variations, offering a significant improvement in cost-efficiency for model fine-tuning.

Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability challenges in distributed attention for LLMs by introducing Mesh-Attention, a new algorithm that efficiently reduces communication-computation (CommCom) ratio compared to Ring-Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome scalability limitations of the current state-of-the-art distributed attention mechanism (Ring-Attention), which suffers from excessive communication traffic, hindering efficiency in large-scale systems.

Method: The proposed Mesh-Attention method uses a two-dimensional tile-based matrix computation assignment to GPUs, reducing communication complexity and improving scalability. A greedy algorithm is introduced to effectively optimize GPU communication scheduling within these tiles.

Result: Mesh-Attention achieves significant performance improvements, including up to 3.4x speedup (average 2.9x) and up to 85.4% communication volume reduction (average 79.0%) on 256 GPUs. It also demonstrates superior scalability in large-scale systems.

Conclusion: Mesh-Attention provides a scalable and efficient solution for distributed attention, significantly outperforming previous methods like Ring-Attention. It reduces bottlenecks in system communication and ensures better performance in large deployments.

Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in analyzing large-scale, dynamic hypergraphs due to the absence of specialized tools, and the importance of hypergraph properties such as triads in understanding complex group interactions.

Method: A GPU-oriented parallel data structure (ESCHER) was developed alongside a triad-count update framework to optimize computations and manage dynamic hypergraphs efficiently.

Result: The proposed framework showed significant speedups in triad counting tasks (up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x) across hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads using real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The ESCHER framework proves highly efficient in managing and analyzing dynamic hypergraphs, outpacing existing methods and enhancing computational performance for triad counting tasks.

Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent language framework evolves strategies by updating external latent vectors through environment interaction, without fine-tuning model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static semantic representations in language models and enable adaptive strategy evolution.

Method: Introduced a dual-loop architecture: behavior loop for adjusting action preferences based on rewards and language loop for updating external latent vectors reflecting text embeddings.

Result: Agents demonstrated stable strategic styles, convergent latent spaces, structured changes during interactions, and adaptability to emotional agents without shared rewards.

Conclusion: External latent space offers a scalable, low-cost way to achieve strategic representation without parameter modification.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

Motivation: The study aims to address the instability and performance degradation of sentiment models during dynamic, event-driven social media content periods.

Method: Evaluated transformer models using authentic social media posts, statistical analyses, introducing four novel drift metrics, and validating them across major events.

Result: Reported accuracy drops of 23.4%, confidence drops of up to 13.0%, and demonstrated better performance of proposed drift metrics compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The zero-training drift analysis enables real-time monitoring of sentiment analysis models, offering practical detection benefits and insights into transformer behavior under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

TL;DR: PHOTON introduces a hierarchical autoregressive model to address latency and memory issues in traditional Transformers by optimizing token processing patterns for higher throughput efficiency in long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges with increasing prefill latency and memory constraints during long-context decoding, limiting efficiency in certain tasks.

Method: PHOTON employs a hierarchical bottom-up encoding and top-down decoding mechanism, compressing and reconstructing token representations for more efficient processing.

Result: PHOTON outperforms Transformer-based models in throughput-quality trade-offs, showcasing significant improvements in both long-context and multi-query task efficiency with reduced memory traffic.

Conclusion: PHOTON offers a superior alternative to traditional Transformers in handling computational and memory efficiency, especially in long-context decoding tasks.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of lung cancer treatment outcomes has been limited by sparse, heterogeneous, and complex electronic health data, along with limitations of traditional models.

Method: The study utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to preprocess multimodal clinical data into task-specific, high-fidelity representations tailored to prediction objectives.

Result: The framework demonstrated a mean AUROC of 0.803, outperforming baselines such as expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and transformers.

Conclusion: The reframed use of LLMs provides a scalable, interpretable, and effective solution for AI-driven clinical decision support in oncology.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

### [141] [Real Time Detection and Quantitative Analysis of Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20634)
*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for language models by introducing a framework to address spurious forgetting from shallow task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address catastrophic forgetting in large language models, focusing on the issue of spurious forgetting caused by shallow task alignment disrupting performance.

Method: They introduce a shallow versus deep alignment framework with metrics, detection methods, visualization tools, and adaptive strategies to promote deep alignment during training.

Result: Results show 86.2-90.6% accuracy in identifying shallow alignment and demonstrate that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1%.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates spurious forgetting, providing effective tools to enhance alignment depth and ensure model robustness in continual learning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

### [142] [Managing the Stochastic: Foundations of Learning in Neuro-Symbolic Systems for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20660)
*Matthew Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework to improve AI coding agents by treating LLMs as part of the environment rather than as decision-making agents, reducing errors during code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in current AI coding systems where LLMs are assigned decision-making roles leading to unpredictable failures such as gaming unit tests and hallucinated syntax.

Method: The proposed framework uses a Dual-State Architecture, separating deterministic control flow (workflow state) from stochastic generation (environment state). Atomic Action Pairs are used for generation-verification transactions, and Guard Functions manage probabilistic outputs.

Result: The framework was tested on three code generation tasks with 13 LLMs of varying sizes. It showed task success rate improvements of up to 66 percentage points with 1.2–2.1 times the baseline computational cost.

Conclusion: Architectural design and constraints can enhance reliable code generation, potentially reducing the need for scaling LLM parameter size.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

### [143] [SHRP: Specialized Head Routing and Pruning for Efficient Encoder Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20635)
*Zeli Su,Ziyin Zhang,Wenzheng Zhang,Zhou Liu,Guixian Xu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHRP, a structured pruning framework focused on removing redundant attention heads in Transformer encoders to reduce latency and memory without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer encoders are widely used for NLP tasks but face challenges in real-time scalability due to high inference latency and memory consumption, driven by architectural redundancies in the attention mechanism.

Method: The proposed SHRP framework features Expert Attention, which treats attention heads as independent experts and incorporates a lightweight shared feed-forward network. A usage-driven mechanism performs dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning during deployment.

Result: On the GLUE benchmark with a BERT-base encoder, SHRP retains 93% accuracy while reducing parameters by 48%. With extreme compression (11/12 layers pruned), it maintains 84% accuracy, achieves a 4.2x throughput gain, and reduces computation to 11.5% of the original FLOPs.

Conclusion: SHRP effectively addresses the challenges of Transformer encoder inefficiencies, delivering significant performance and resource gains, making it practical for large-scale, latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FEM-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of language models to generate scientifically valid computational mechanics models and finite element code. Current state-of-the-art models face challenges with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks for assessing the ability of language models to generate accurate and scientifically valid physical models, particularly in computational mechanics.

Method: Developed FEM-Bench 2025, comprising tasks based on first graduate course concepts in computational mechanics, to test LLMs' ability to generate finite element methods and scientific code under stringent constraints.

Result: State-of-the-art models showed variable success. Gemini 3 Pro solved 30/33 tasks at least once, GPT-5 achieved a 73.8% Average Joint Success Rate, while other models showed inconsistent performance.

Conclusion: FEM-Bench provides a structured framework for evaluating AI's physical reasoning and scientific modeling capabilities, with potential to evolve and facilitate progress in computational mechanics modeling.

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

### [145] [Data-Free Pruning of Self-Attention Layers in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20636)
*Dhananjay Saikumar,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gate-Norm, a pruning method for self-attention layers in large language models, improving efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the inference efficiency of large language models by identifying and removing redundant self-attention layers without requiring extensive calibration or data-driven approaches.

Method: The proposed method, Gate-Norm, ranks attention layers based on query-key coupling and removes less coupled layers. It uses a one-shot, weight-only criterion without the need for calibration data or fine-tuning.

Result: Applying Gate-Norm to 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models resulted in higher inference throughput (up to 1.30x) while maintaining near-baseline accuracy across various tasks within a 2% deviation.

Conclusion: Gate-Norm offers an effective, fast, and data-free approach for pruning self-attention layers in large language models, making it suitable for practical compression with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves forecasting in the n-body problem using Scientific ML frameworks, indicating UDEs are more data-efficient than NODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve predictive models for the motion of n bodies under gravitational force by embedding physical laws directly into machine learning frameworks, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional black-box models.

Method: The authors used Scientific ML approaches, specifically Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), implemented in Julia. They determined forecasting efficiency and robustness by using noisy, synthetic datasets.

Result: UDEs were found to be more efficient, requiring only 20% of data for accurate forecasting, compared to Neural ODEs, which needed 90%.

Conclusion: Embedding physical laws into ML models enhances data efficiency and interpretability, with UDEs outperforming traditional and Neural ODE approaches.

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses subgroup discovery in survival analysis using the Cox model, introducing new quality metrics and algorithms for better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the problem of finding interpretable subgroups within survival analysis data where a Cox model is highly effective. Existing quality functions for subgroup discovery fail to cater to these types of analyses.

Method: They propose two innovations: Expected Prediction Entropy (EPE) for evaluating survival models and Conditional Rank Statistics (CRS) to measure data point deviations from subgroups. They design eight algorithms leveraging these metrics and performed theoretical and empirical evaluations.

Result: The proposed techniques recover ground-truth subgroups and provide better model fits in both synthetic and real datasets. A case study on jet engine simulation data demonstrated the practical significance of the methods by uncovering critical design insights.

Conclusion: The contributions introduce practical and theory-backed tools for subgroup discovery in survival analysis, enhancing the performance of Cox models in both research and real-world applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-RUN, a quantum-inspired neural network model that applies quantum principles to classical architectures for better data and predictive modeling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome the scalability constraints of current quantum hardware while leveraging the Fourier-expressive capabilities of quantum neural networks.

Method: The Q-RUN integrates the mathematical concept of quantum data re-uploading circuits into classical network models, enabling quantum benefits without quantum hardware.

Result: Q-RUN reduces parameters in models and cuts errors significantly (by 1–3 orders of magnitude) across several tasks, outperforming standard layers and state-of-the-art architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-RUN framework shows how quantum machine learning concepts can lead to more effective and expressive AI models, serving as an improvement for various neural networks.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskOpt, a large-scale dataset and benchmark for IC mask optimization based on real designs rather than synthetic layouts, and evaluates deep learning methods for accuracy and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in mask optimization methods using synthetic datasets, and incorporate real IC designs with context-aware mask optimization to improve practical applicability.

Method: Construct the MaskOpt dataset from real IC designs for metal and via layers, conserve standard-cell information, support varying context sizes, and benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Result: MaskOpt dataset includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Benchmarks reveal trade-offs in model performance and emphasize the importance of context-aware inputs and surrounding geometries.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based mask optimization benefits from context-awareness and cell-aware inputs, improving mask generation accuracy when leveraging real IC designs and appropriate benchmarks like MaskOpt.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

### [150] [Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21075)
*Zihan Yao,Ruoyu Wu,Tianxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses training instability and diminishing returns of large neural models, focusing on feature learning at deep layers in ResNets. It introduces Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) and proposes a depth-aware learning-rate correction to resolve issues and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when and why scaling laws succeed or fail for deep neural networks, particularly focusing on the role of depth and feature learning dynamics in ResNets.

Method: The paper derives Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) in the infinite-width and infinite-depth limit, analyzes feature learning collapse in two-layer residual blocks, and proposes a depth-aware learning-rate correction.

Result: NFD explains scaling trends, diminishing returns, and resolves feature-learning collapse with a depth-aware learning-rate correction, improving deeper ResNet's performance.

Conclusion: Infinite-depth analysis provides insights into feature learning dynamics. Correcting depth-wise learning rates restores feature learning, enabling effective scaling for deeper models.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

TL;DR: Text-to-image diffusion models face a challenge in balancing multi-concept prompts, as dominant concepts suppress others. Researchers proposed DominanceBench to analyze and understand this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the imbalance issue in text-to-image diffusion models when processing multi-concept prompts, where dominant tokens overshadow others.

Method: The authors introduce DominanceBench and conduct systematic analysis through data and cross-attention dynamics. Experiments include studying data diversity and attention mechanisms.

Result: Findings show limited diversity in training data worsens inter-concept interference. Dominant tokens saturate attention over time, and ablation studies pinpoint distributed attention mechanisms as a cause of imbalance.

Conclusion: The study offers critical insights into generative collapse, paving the way for improving text-to-image generation methods to achieve balanced and reliable output.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOTON, an algorithm aimed at addressing the limitations of backpropagation and alternative methods, demonstrating forward-only training for neural networks of any depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation's computational cost becomes a significant burden as neural network architectures grow, prompting exploration of alternative training methods.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze constraints of existing methods like PEPITA to design a new forward-only algorithm utilizing orthogonal and linear assumptions, further relaxing linear assumptions to develop the FOTON algorithm.

Result: FOTON eliminates the need for backward passes in neural network training, surpassing PEPITA in capability by successfully training networks of any depth and showing strong performance with convolutional architectures.

Conclusion: FOTON's ability to train deep neural networks efficiently, with promising results on advanced architectures, demonstrates its potential to replace backpropagation in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to
  train neural networks.
  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

*Roy Turgeman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the conditions where low-level preprocessing, such as denoising and encoding, improves classification performance even with modern deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although the data processing inequality implies no information gain from preprocessing for optimal classifiers, real-world scenarios commonly involve low-level processing preceding classification. The motivation is to understand under what circumstances and why these preprocessing steps enhance classification.

Method: The authors present both theoretical analyses and empirical studies. They examine binary classification with classifiers converging to optimal Bayes classifiers, proving that preprocessing can improve results with finite training samples under certain conditions. Empirical tests on benchmark datasets analyze factors like sample size, class balance, and noise.

Result: The study confirms theoretically and empirically that low-level preprocessing can improve classification under certain conditions, such as limited training samples or imbalances in the dataset. Trends from real-world deep classifiers support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Low-level preprocessing, such as denoising and encoding, can improve classification accuracy in practical scenarios involving finite or imbalanced datasets. This contrasts with implications of the data processing inequality, underlining the value of preprocessing even with advanced classifiers.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

Method: The authors propose a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture to generate synthetic clinical records aligned with real-world observations for cardiac rehabilitation analysis.

Result: The CVAE demonstrates the capability to produce coherent, realistic synthetic data that improves the performance of classifiers in cardiac risk prediction, outperforming previous deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Using the CVAE can increase dataset size, improve cardiac risk prediction models, and potentially reduce the dependency on invasive diagnostic testing.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

### [155] [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326)
*Sida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how to effectively apply statistical methods to LLM evaluations by separating prediction, data, and total noise levels, proposing the all-pairs paired method for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluators need to accurately measure and compare the performance of LLMs in the presence of noise, which impacts experimental validity.

Method: The all-pairs paired method was introduced to apply paired statistical analysis across LLM pairs, identifying and measuring noise components using large-scale question predictions.

Result: The study found consistent total noise levels across model pairs, paired prediction noise being dominant over data noise, and demonstrated that averaging can enhance statistical power.

Conclusion: By understanding predictable noise patterns and reducing prediction noise, practitioners can assess significance, detect smaller effects, and improve LLM evaluation robustness.

Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

*Weilin Zhou,Zonghao Ying,Junjie Mu,Shengwei Tian,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mainstream fake news detection methodologies overlook crucial cross-modal discrepancies by treating them as noise. To resolve this, the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF) amplifies contradictions instead, achieving notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on consistency-based fusion for detecting fake news but overlook subtle cross-modal discrepancies, which are key evidence of fabrication.

Method: DCCF seeks cross-modal inconsistencies by decoupling inputs into Fact and Sentiment spaces, employing dynamics to polarize features, and standardizing local discrepancies for robust judgment.

Result: Experiments on three datasets consistently show DCCF exceeding state-of-the-art baselines by an average accuracy improvement of 3.52%.

Conclusion: DCCF demonstrates the efficacy of amplifying cross-modal contradictions for fake news detection, offering a significant performance boost over traditional consistency-based approaches.

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

*Yuanhao Xi,Xiaohuan Bing,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA introduces hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling to enhance mobile Vision Language Models (VLMs), achieving significant improvements without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational demands and limitations of standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in training mobile VLMs for processing both text and image modalities.

Method: Proposes the HyDRA framework with hierarchical optimization (coarse-grained across layers, fine-grained within layers) and dynamic end-to-end rank adjustment using performance modeling.

Result: HyDRA significantly outperforms baselines, achieving a 4.7% average improvement across tasks while maintaining parameter efficiency, even surpassing full-parameter fine-tuning in some cases.

Conclusion: HyDRA offers an efficient fine-tuning approach that enhances the performance of mobile VLMs without increasing computational costs, making it practical and advantageous.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning generalizable reward functions for embodied intelligence and compare recent VLM-based reward models effectively.

Method: The study uses Meta-World tasks to compare different VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with consistent backbones, data, and evaluation environments. Modeling accuracy is measured via consistency with ground truth and correlation with expert progress.

Result: A simple triplet loss surpasses state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that variations in data and architectures heavily influence recent improvements.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the necessity of increasingly complex learning objectives, emphasizing the impact of consistent experimental setups and simpler loss functions.

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

Result: The proposed regularized fusion method validated theoretical findings, enhancing consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy in multimodal autoencoders compared to existing strategies.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding and enhancing fusion methods in multimodal autoencoders, contributing to improved model performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in verifying neural networks using early exit architectures for both robustness and efficiency and presents an improved, validated algorithm enhancing these metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure AI systems are safe and efficient, specifically by leveraging formal verification for robustness and enhancing inference efficiency through early exits.

Method: The authors define a robustness property for early exit architectures, use solvers for assessment, and propose a baseline algorithm with early stopping and heuristic optimizations.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks confirmed the effectiveness of their framework, demonstrating performance gains and enhanced verifiability from the improved algorithm.

Conclusion: Early exit architectures not only accelerate inference but also improve robustness verification, aiding users in balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

### [161] [Generalization of RLVR Using Causal Reasoning as a Testbed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20760)
*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving large language models (LLMs) in probabilistic reasoning tasks, comparing its generalization to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) across multiple complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand under what conditions RLVR enhances generalization in large language models for performing probabilistic inference on causal graphical models.

Method: The study uses datasets of causal graphs and queries (associational, interventional, counterfactual) to fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models via both RLVR and SFT. They vary model scale (3B-32B) and query levels during training.

Result: RLVR showed better generalization than SFT in specific scenarios, such as when models started with adequate reasoning skills, improving strategies like marginalization and complex query accuracy.

Conclusion: RLVR enhances specific reasoning subskills in causal inference but requires sufficient initial competence in the LLM to realize its benefits.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights evaluation issues with Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) and introduces TS-Arena, a new platform for unbiased and sustainable forecasting evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the evaluation crisis in TSFMs caused by overlapping training and test sets, as well as improper use of global patterns, which lead to compromised benchmarking.

Method: The authors propose TS-Arena, a platform that uses a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams and ensures strict temporal separation between training and test data by treating the unknown future as the test environment.

Result: The proposed platform enforces a moving temporal frontier, preventing historical contamination and enabling authentic assessments of model generalization on real-world data.

Conclusion: TS-Arena restores evaluation integrity in TSFMs and offers a scalable infrastructure for fair and realistic comparison of forecasting models, starting with applications in the energy sector.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve matrix exponential computation for high-throughput generative AI systems, addressing limitations in accuracy and computational efficiency present in traditional methods.

Method: The method employs enhanced polynomial evaluation schemes for Taylor series, dynamic selection of Taylor order, and scaling factors, complemented by rigorous error analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior efficiency and numerical stability over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach establishes itself as a powerful and efficient solution for large-scale generative modeling tasks in AI.

Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.

Motivation: The motivation is to address drawbacks of neural network models in predictability by leveraging symbolic regression's ability to offer interpretable and generalizable analytical equations.

Method: The authors applied the SEGVAE symbolic regression algorithm to predict properties of defective two-dimensional materials and compared its performance with advanced graph neural network methods.

Result: The symbolic regression approach produced results that were comparable or identical to those obtained using state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression methods like SEGVAE are shown to be effective and interpretable for applications in predicting material properties, with promising implications for the natural sciences.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLiBRL, a novel deep Bayesian reinforcement learning method that improves efficiency and accuracy in learning models and task parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BRL methods struggle with real-world applicability due to the need for known transition and reward models, leading to challenges in optimization and policy quality.

Method: GLiBRL uses Generalised Linear Models with Learnable Basis Functions to provide tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference for transition and reward models.

Result: On MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL outperforms methods like VariBAD, MAML, RL2, and others, improving success rates significantly.

Conclusion: GLiBRL offers an efficient and low-variance solution for deep BRL, showing consistent and robust performance on benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) provides a framework for generalisation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems from its use of Bayesian task parameters in the transition and reward models. However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research introduces a dual specialist ensemble framework combining environmental contagion and structural fragility to enhance wildfire risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires increasingly impact urban areas, requiring models that account for complex contagion dynamics in the wildland urban interface.

Method: A dual specialist ensemble framework integrates graph neural networks for environmental analysis and XGBoost for structural resilience prediction.

Result: The framework identifies neighborhood environmental pressure as dominant in fire propagation and structural eaves as critical vulnerability points.

Conclusion: The approach enables targeted mitigation strategies, improving community resilience against wildfire risks by addressing environmental and structural vulnerabilities.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in bandwidth utilization and privacy in Federated Learning while maintaining efficient convergence rates.

Method: The algorithm encodes high-dimensional gradients via directional derivatives along random vectors, reducing communication costs, and uses multi-projection averaging for decoding.

Result: FedMPDD achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate comparable to FedSGD and improves privacy against gradient inversion attacks.

Conclusion: FedMPDD successfully balances cost, privacy, and convergence efficiency, validated by theory and benchmark experiments.

Abstract: This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in machine learning models caused by adversarial threats, which can mislead models via perturbations, data poisoning, or information theft.

Method: The authors propose a defense system incorporating adversarial training into a mixture-of-experts model, using nine pre-trained ResNet-18 experts and optimizing the parameters during end-to-end training.

Result: The proposed defense system demonstrated superior robustness against adversarial threats compared to state-of-the-art defenses and classifiers with more complex architectures.

Conclusion: Leveraging mixture-of-experts and adversarial training enhances the model's robustness while outperforming other defense systems.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer models are challenging to run on limited hardware due to their size and computational costs. Block low-rank (BLR) compression alleviates these challenges, and new custom kernels achieve significant performance improvements on NVIDIA GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in the size of transformer-based foundation models poses challenges for fitting them on single GPUs and managing their high computational costs. BLR compression addresses these challenges, but existing methods suffer from inefficiencies during multi-token inference.

Method: The authors used roofline analysis to identify bottlenecks in BLR methods and developed custom Triton kernels with fusion and memory optimizations. This implementation is applied to models like Llama and GPT2 on NVIDIA GPUs.

Result: The custom kernels showed up to 3.76× speedup and 3× model size compression compared to PyTorch baselines on NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40.

Conclusion: Introducing optimized kernels demonstrates a significant improvement in runtime and memory efficiency for BLR-based transformer models, enabling their usage on resource-constrained GPUs. The proposed methods and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

Method: The authors formulate gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system and adapt barrier certificates from control theory to certify robustness. They parameterize these certificates as neural networks and derive PAC bounds using scenario convex programming.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 demonstrated non-trivial perturbation budgets, model-agnostic robustness, and no prior attack knowledge requirement.

Conclusion: The framework provides the first unified formal guarantees for both training and test-time adversarial threats, enhancing the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

*Sami Marouani,Kamal Singh,Baptiste Jeudy,Amaury Habrard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FlowKANet, a novel approach using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to improve flow delay prediction in communication networks with reduced parameters, and explores symbolic surrogate models for lightweight deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to optimize the prediction of flow delays in modern communication networks to enhance their efficiency and manageability, addressing challenges of accuracy, parameter efficiency, and transparent deployments.

Method: The authors investigate three modeling levels: utilizing a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, introducing FlowKANet with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, and employing symbolic surrogate models through block-wise regression.

Result: The results demonstrate that FlowKANet achieves competitive predictive performance with reduced parameters, while the symbolic surrogate models provide lightweight deployment and offer greater transparency.

Conclusion: FlowKANet and its symbolic surrogates offer an efficient and transparent way to model flow delays, balancing accuracy and resource efficiency in practical network management.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

### [173] [DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905)
*Haidong Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering) utilizes internal activations of pretrained diffusion U-Nets to perform unsupervised clustering, optimizing their selection for maximum clusterability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep clustering by leveraging representation trajectories within pretrained diffusion models instead of relying on fixed embeddings of a single encoder.

Method: A two-stage process: selecting clustering-optimal timestep and layer, training with a KL self-training objective augmented with graph and entropy regularizations, and incorporating a denoising-consistency branch for stability.

Result: DiEC demonstrates competitive clustering performance across various standard benchmarks by leveraging diffusion U-Net properties.

Conclusion: The study showcases the utility of exploiting pretrained diffusion models' internal trajectories, presenting a robust method for representation learning in unsupervised clustering tasks.

Abstract: Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: The study presents GCO-HPIF, a machine-learning framework for predicting and explaining computational hardness of graph-based combinatorial optimization problems, showing high performance with multiple algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework capable of predicting computational hardness and explaining the reasoning behind predictions for combinatorial optimization problems on graphs.

Method: The study uses a two-stage approach: generating graph features and hardness classifications for machine learning prediction, and explaining predictions via association rule mining; it also applies regression models to predict computation times.

Result: The GCO-HPIF framework achieved high prediction accuracy (weighted F1: 0.9921, minority-class F1: 0.878, ROC-AUC: 0.9083), explained predictions effectively with a rule accuracy of 87.64%, and used regression to predict computation times with a 5.12% RMSE and R2=0.991.

Conclusion: The GCO-HPIF framework is both effective and interpretable, providing robust performance in predicting and explaining hardness of graph-related combinatorial problems, strengthening its utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.

*Ningyuan Liu,Jing Yang,Kaitong Cai,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RevFFN proposes a memory-efficient method for fine-tuning large language models without requiring extra hardware resources, by using reversible Transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models requires substantial memory due to intermediate activations, which limits scalability with current hardware.

Method: RevFFN uses reversible Transformer blocks to reconstruct input activations, thus reducing memory requirements during backpropagation for mixture of experts models.

Result: RevFFN enables full parameter fine-tuning of large models on standard GPUs without extra hardware resources, drastically decreasing peak memory usage.

Conclusion: RevFFN offers a practical solution to fine-tune large LLMs efficiently, making it more accessible without additional hardware demands.

Abstract: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing subscription pricing by balancing revenue, margin, retention, customer trust, and operational constraints in a dynamic, data-driven manner.

Method: The study blends seasonal time-series models and tree-based learners, employs Monte Carlo scenario testing to evaluate risks, and applies constrained optimization to ensure compliance with business guardrails on customer experience and profitability. The framework uses APIs for real-time updates and incorporates model explainability.

Result: The proposed method outperformed static pricing strategies in real-world SaaS portfolios by reallocating price changes toward higher-paying customers while safeguarding more price-sensitive ones.

Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

*Yiren Shen,Juan J. Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how training data size affects the accuracy of a graph neural network (GNN)-based aerodynamic surrogate model and creates a multi-fidelity dataset for double-delta wings for further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a lack of open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines on the relationship between dataset size and surrogate model performance, particularly in aerodynamic predictions.

Method: A multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset was generated for double-delta wings and was used to train a GNN-based surrogate model. Six datasets of varying sizes (from 40 to 1280 snapshots) were used to conduct an empirical scaling study under a fixed training budget.

Result: The study showed that test error decreases with training data size following a power-law relationship. Larger surrogate models demonstrated more efficient data utilization and highlighted a potential trade-off between dataset cost and training budget.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that increasing dataset size improves prediction accuracy, with an estimated optimal sampling density and proof of efficient data utilization. The results emphasize a balance between dataset generation cost and surrogate model training.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flexible operator learning framework using Gaussian processes to solve functional renormalization group equations efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations is important for understanding complex systems, but existing methods lack flexibility and accuracy in handling certain types of functional solutions.

Method: The approach employs Gaussian process operator learning to represent functional equations directly on function space without being restricted to specific discretizations or equations. Physical priors can also be incorporated in the design.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing local-potential approximation methods on equations like the Wetterich and Wilson–Polchinski equations, while being more adaptable to non-standard scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework shows promise for solving complex functional equations, including cases involving non-constant fields like instantons, marking its potential for broader applications.

Abstract: We present an operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations, which are integro-differential equations defined on functionals. Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to navigate the vast chemical space to develop synthetically accessible, high-affinity drug candidates. Traditional methods lack the capability for multi-objective optimization and novel exploration.

Method: The framework leverages ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify related proteins, initializes a fragment-based search space using known drug ligands, and uses PPO with ChemBERTa encoding for chemical transformations.

Result: ReACT-Drug generates de novo drugs with competitive binding affinity, high synthetic accessibility, and chemical validity (benchmarking 100% on MOSES).

Conclusion: ReACT-Drug demonstrates the potential for integrating structural biology, deep learning, and synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

Abstract: De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether agentic AI systems can match human data scientists, especially in leveraging domain-specific knowledge for complex data-driven tasks.

Method: Designed a synthetic prediction task involving hidden latent variables in image data, challenging AI systems reliant on generic tabular data workflows, and verified results with property insurance datasets.

Result: Agentic AI relying on generic workflows underperformed compared to approaches that incorporated domain-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: Current agentic AI systems lack adequate domain-specific understanding and need significant advancements to fulfill their potential in complex data science tasks.

Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diffusion models manage memorization and generalization, and to propose methods for better controlling and detecting these phenomena for improved generative modeling.

Method: Analyzed memorization and generalization in representation learning using theoretical proofs and experiments on real-world diffusion models. Proposed a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique for representation steering.

Result: Establishes theoretical distinctions between memorization (spiky representations) and generalization (balanced representations). Validated findings on real-world models, showing the recurring structural patterns and implications for generative models.

Conclusion: Learning effective representations is crucial for producing novel and meaningful generative models. Proposed tools provide better detection and control over memorization in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.

Method: The method involves a four-layer architecture (input, formatting, re-scaling, segmentation), use of a pre-trained ML algorithm, an overlapping technique, and parameter optimization using a heuristic based on the Window Difference metric.

Result: The model produces a binary, noise-free matrix representing the optimal segmentation, along with segmentation points. It demonstrates better performance than prior methods.

Conclusion: CoSeNet is a robust, generalizable, and efficient method for segmenting noisy correlation matrices, balancing between efficiency, memory, and speed.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework, which evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, competitive, multi-round simulation instead of static benchmarks. It offers robust methods like expected win scores and failure sensitivity analysis for better insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the limitations of task-specific, fragmented metrics in evaluating LLMs, which fail to capture dynamic performance and vulnerability in high-stakes tasks.

Method: The CSD framework uses sequential contests based on win-loss records, Monte Carlo simulations to calculate expected win scores, and a failure sensitivity analysis to evaluate model robustness and risk profiles.

Result: CSD provides context-aware rankings and distinguishes model characteristics such as robustness and specialization more effectively than static scoring systems.

Conclusion: CSD is a significant improvement over traditional evaluation methods, offering a nuanced, risk-aware, and dynamic approach to compare LLM capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

Motivation: To address prediction challenges in cloud native backend systems experiencing highly dynamic loads, interconnected metrics, and parallel tasks.

Method: Develops a shared encoding structure, state fusion mechanism, cross-task propagation module, and dynamic adjustment mechanism to adapt predictions to dynamic system environments.

Result: Shows superior performance across error metrics, improved adaptability to dynamic operating conditions, and stable predictive accuracy in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework reliably supports intelligent backend system management in complex, high-dimensional cloud native environments.

Abstract: This study proposes a unified forecasting framework for high-dimensional multi-task time series to meet the prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks. The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

*Gregory Duthé,Nikolaos Evangelou,Wei Liu,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers for modeling dynamical systems, analyzing their performance under linear and nonlinear cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the internal mechanisms of Transformers applied to time-series data from a dynamical systems perspective to address the lack of theoretical foundation compared to classical models.

Method: Analyzing causal self-attention as a linear recurrence and exploring operational regimes through studies on linear and nonlinear dynamical systems.

Result: Transformers are limited in oscillatory settings due to the convexity constraint of softmax attention, while they can effectively reconstruct states in nonlinear systems via adaptive delay-embedding under adequate context and latent dimensionality.

Conclusion: Insights from this study integrate classical dynamical systems theory with empirical observations, guiding the effective application of Transformers to various dynamical systems scenarios.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

*Shi Quan Foo,Chi-Ho Wong,Zhihan Gao,Dit-Yan Yeung,Ka-Hing Wong,Wai-Kin Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the STLDM model for precipitation nowcasting, using a diffusion-based architecture to overcome limitations in current models, offering improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing precipitation nowcasting models face challenges such as producing blurry predictions in deterministic models and poor accuracy in generative models, due to the complexity and stochasticity of the task.

Method: The paper proposes STLDM, a two-stage model involving a deterministic forecasting conditioning network and a latent enhancement stage using a latent diffusion model.

Result: STLDM outperforms current state-of-the-art models in precipitation nowcasting across multiple radar datasets, achieving better accuracy and increased inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The STLDM model effectively addresses key issues in precipitation nowcasting, combining deterministic and diffusion model elements to deliver superior predictive performance and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We show that MODE achieves (1-1/e)-approximation with O(n \log n) complexity and demonstrates competitive accuracy while providing interpretable insights into data utility evolution. Experiments show \mode reduces memory requirements

*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BALLAST, an adaptive timeout mechanism for Raft to address the issues with long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery. BALLAST utilizes contextual bandits for dynamic adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static timeout heuristics in Raft struggle during scenarios with long-tail latency or partition recovery, causing prolonged unavailability and inefficiency.

Method: BALLAST employs contextual bandits (LinUCB variants) to select dynamic timeout configurations, using safe exploration techniques to reduce risk during unstable network conditions.

Result: The evaluation via simulation demonstrates that BALLAST significantly improves recovery and unwritable times in challenging WAN scenarios while maintaining competitive performance in stable LAN/WAN conditions.

Conclusion: BALLAST provides an effective solution to enhance Raft's liveness in variable and turbulent network conditions by replacing brittle static heuristics with adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Randomized election timeouts are a simple and effective liveness heuristic for Raft, but they become brittle under long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, where repeated split votes can inflate unavailability. This paper presents BALLAST, a lightweight online adaptation mechanism that replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits. BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout "arms" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence. Across challenging WAN regimes, BALLAST substantially reduces recovery time and unwritable time compared to standard randomized timeouts and common heuristics, while remaining competitive on stable LAN/WAN settings.

Abstract: The paper presents novel Universum-enhanced classifiers: the Universum Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal Support Vector Machine (U-GEPSVM) and the Improved U-GEPSVM (IU-GEPSVM) for EEG signal classification. Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.

*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework to study stability in deep learning systems by analyzing the dynamics of representations and parameters, leading to stability profiles and Lyapunov-based energy dissipation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding stability in deep learning systems is essential for ensuring robustness and sensitivity to perturbations across architectures and optimization methods.

Method: The framework introduces Learning Stability Profiles and proves a theorem linking bounded stability profiles to Lyapunov energy dissipation, extending applicability to both smooth and non-smooth learning regimes.

Result: The framework explains stability behaviors in feedforward networks, residual architectures, stochastic gradient methods, and non-smooth systems such as ReLU networks, using generalized derivatives and variational energies.

Conclusion: This work unifies the description of stability across diverse learning systems and shows how design choices influence robustness, offering a foundation for further extensions in learning dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.

*Andres M Bran,Tong Xie,Shai Pranesh,Jeffrey Meng,Xuan Vu Nguyen,Jeremy Goumaz,David Ming Segura,Ruizhi Xu,Dongzhan Zhou,Wenjie Zhang,Bram Hoex,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper unveils the critical constraint of reinforcement learning in Large Language Models, termed 'latent solvability', and proposes mid-stage scientific training (MiST) to enhance reasoning capabilities in chemistry. The MiST techniques significantly improve model performance on chemical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of reinforcement learning in enabling reasoning in Large Language Models, particularly in the field of chemistry, by identifying the necessary conditions for successful training and enhancing model capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce MiST (mid-stage scientific training) techniques, focusing on SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on a large chemical dataset, and supervised fine-tuning. These methods enhance symbolic competence and latent chemical knowledge.

Result: The use of MiST improves the latent-solvability score by up to 1.8x and significantly increases accuracy in chemical tasks such as organic reaction naming (from 10.9% to 63.9%) and inorganic material generation (from 40.6% to 67.4%). Similar improvements were found in other challenging chemical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of mid-stage scientific training in unlocking reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models for chemistry, setting clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning and showcasing potential broader applications of MiST techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

*Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Dongwei Xu,Qi Xuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARS-OPT, a momentum-based optimization algorithm for hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, achieving faster convergence and query efficiency by optimizing directional updates and incorporating surrogate-model priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-label black-box adversarial attacks face significant query complexity challenges, making their practical deployment difficult.

Method: The proposed method, ARS-OPT, uses momentum-based optimization inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient to estimate gradients for better optimization, with an extension (PARS-OPT) incorporating surrogate-model priors.

Result: Experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show significant improvement in query efficiency over 13 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ARS-OPT and PARS-OPT improve query efficiency and optimization stability in adversarial attacks, supported by theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### [193] [Model Merging via Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21288)
*Seyed Arshan Dalili,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalization in model merging for multi-task learning with scarce data, introducing theoretical guarantees and proposing SAMerging as an alternative method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the limitations in current model merging approaches, which rely heavily on heuristics and face performance brittleness due to lack of theoretical insight into generalization properties.

Method: They develop a flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound with a cross-task heterogeneity term and propose SAMerging, leveraging Sharpness-Aware Minimization for multi-teacher knowledge distillation on unlabeled data.

Result: The proposed SAMerging method outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results on vision and NLP benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMerging demonstrates the effectiveness of theoretically-driven methods in enhancing model merging, offering robust generalization capabilities for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a "cross-task heterogeneity" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.

TL;DR: This study introduces a computational framework combining genetic profiling and de novo drug discovery to develop personalized treatments for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective, targeted therapies for AML patients due to its molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates.

Method: The framework uses RNA-sequencing data processed with Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis to identify biomarkers. Structural modeling (AlphaFold) and hotspots mapping (DOGSiteScorer) guide the generation of drug candidates using a novel metaheuristic algorithm and multi-objective optimization.

Result: The study generated unique drug-like chemical entities, validated through molecular docking and profiling, with a candidate (Ligand L1) showing promising binding energy to a specific biomarker.

Conclusion: Integrating systems biology and computational drug discovery shows potential for creating scalable, personalized treatments for AML and possibly other cancers.

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond

*Lilian Welschinger,Yilin Liu,Zican Wang,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to solve surface PDEs directly in neural representations without mesh extraction or per-instance optimization by using a trained local update operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the mismatch between traditional PDE solvers operating on triangle meshes and modern 3D neural representations, allowing end-to-end workflows for solving PDEs in the neural domain.

Method: The method involves designing a local update operator that uses neural shape attributes, trained once on a single shape, to generalize across shapes and avoid explicit meshing or residual training processes.

Result: The approach outperforms CPM slightly and achieves results close to FEM across benchmarks and neural representations, providing accurate and fast inference without the need for mesh extraction.

Conclusion: This is the first end-to-end pipeline enabling PDE solutions directly on neural as well as classical surface representations, enhancing applicability in shape analysis and engineering tasks.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

### [196] [Anytime Metaheuristic Framework for Global Route Optimization in Expected-Time Mobile Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20711)
*Jan Mikula,Miroslav Kulich*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents "Milaps," a new model-based framework for Expected-Time Mobile Search (ETS), achieving better solution quality and runtime trade-offs than existing methods by utilizing metaheuristics and auxiliary objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of optimizing mobile robotic search in continuous environments, which involve motion and visibility complexities, to reduce the search time for hidden objects.

Method: Milaps combines novel auxiliary objectives and adapts metaheuristics originally designed for the traveling deliveryman problem to optimize global routes for mobile search in continuous environments.

Result: Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show Milaps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by generating preliminary solutions quickly and enabling metaheuristic-based optimization, achieving better trade-offs between runtime and solution quality.

Conclusion: Milaps demonstrates flexibility across various scenarios and provides a robust solution framework for mobile robotic search tasks in continuous environments.

Abstract: Expected-time mobile search (ETS) is a fundamental robotics task where a mobile sensor navigates an environment to minimize the expected time required to locate a hidden object. Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generalized framework for vision-based interception of dynamic targets using monocular cameras across multiple robotic platforms, showcasing robust and efficient real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous interception of non-cooperative, dynamic targets in diverse and constrained environments using only local observations without global data.

Method: The approach integrates an Extended Kalman Filter for pose estimation, a history-conditioned motion predictor for trajectory forecasting, and a receding-horizon planner for real-time path planning under constraints.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated high interception success rates, low errors, and real-time execution across simulated and physical tests, using platforms such as UAVs, rovers, and spacecraft testbeds.

Conclusion: The framework proves adaptable, computationally efficient, and robust across heterogeneous robotic systems and challenging observability conditions, making it suitable for various autonomous interception tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a general purpose framework for autonomous, vision-based interception of dynamic, non-cooperative targets, validated across three distinct mobility platforms: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a four-wheeled ground rover, and an air-thruster spacecraft testbed. The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5. These results highlight the framework's generalizability, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This dataset supports the development of weight-sensitive, adaptive robotic behaviors for more effective human-robot interactions.

Abstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to monitor instability in feedback systems using dynamical indicators of resilience, applicable to a broad range of engineered devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feedback systems face instability due to incremental damage, which traditional model-based methods cannot adequately predict as the system diverges from its model.

Method: The paper proposes a non-model-based safety monitor leveraging the concept of critical slowing down, a universal phenomenon observed in numerous complex systems nearing criticality.

Result: The approach was validated using drones and demonstrated its effective potential for real-time early warning and resilient design across multiple engineered systems.

Conclusion: Generic indicators of resilience can enhance stability monitoring in engineered systems, providing wider applicability beyond conventional model-dependent methods and aiding robust system design.

Abstract: Maintaining stability in feedback systems, from aircraft and autonomous robots to biological and physiological systems, relies on monitoring their behavior and continuously adjusting their inputs. Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or "tinkering". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.

*Kanata Suzuki,Shota Shimizu,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to understand robot motion through video captioning tasks using robot trajectory data and evaluates its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between language and low-level robot motion information within VLMs, addressing their limitations due to lack of direct robot motion data in training.

Method: The proposed method generates captions for robot tasks by integrating image captions with trajectory data and performs sub-task segmentation using text embedding similarity.

Result: Experiments in a simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in generating accurate captions and segmentations linked to robot motion data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that VLMs can understand and process robot motion when enhanced with trajectory data, contributing to improved robot imitation learning and task performance evaluation.

Abstract: From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in achieving high spatial resolution, self-decoupled capacity, and insensitivity to off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors.

Result: The sensor demonstrated high linear spatial response (0.996), continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions, operating effectively during stretching, bending, and extreme conditions like piercing and cutting.

Conclusion: This tactile sensor showcases advanced capabilities suitable for real-time precise applications, such as trajectory tracking in soft robotics and human-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Stretchable sensors indicate promising prospects for soft robotics, medical devices, and human-machine interactions due to the high compliance of soft materials. Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.

*Baoshan Song,Matthew Giamou,Penggao Yan,Chunxi Xia,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a globally optimal solution for aligning local systems with GNSS references, even in degraded conditions with minimal satellite availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of local minima and dependency on abundant satellite availability in GNSS alignment for robust and reliable navigation.

Method: The authors formulate the problem as a nonconvex QCQP, relax it to a concave Lagrangian dual problem, conduct relaxation tightness analysis, and evaluate the method through simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The proposed method successfully provides certifiable optimality even with sparse satellite data, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The solution fills the gap in GNSS alignment techniques by providing a globally optimal, certifiable approach. Code and data are open-sourced for further development.

Abstract: Estimating the absolute orientation of a local system relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference often suffers from local minima and high dependency on satellite availability. Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice. To support the development of GNSS-based navigation techniques in robotics, all code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Baoshan-Song/Certifiable-Doppler-alignment.

*Shuhao Ye,Sitong Mao,Yuxiang Cui,Xuan Yu,Shichao Zhai,Wen Chen,Shunbo Zhou,Rong Xiong,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents ETP-R1, a graph-based Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) framework that integrates large-scale data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to achieve advanced performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance and efficiency of graph-based VLN-CE models by leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms, addressing their limitations compared to Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).

Method: The authors created a large-scale pretraining dataset with the Gemini API containing diverse, high-quality instructions. They applied a three-stage training approach, including joint pretraining and the novel use of closed-loop online RFT via the GRPO algorithm.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, setting new standards across all key metrics.

Conclusion: ETP-R1 successfully bridges the gap between graph-based methods and LVLMs, demonstrating the efficacy of combining large datasets, advanced pretraining, and RFT techniques in VLN-CE tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an embodied agent to navigate towards target in continuous environments, following natural language instructions. While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

*Jiangen He,Wanqi Zhang,Jessica Barfield*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines how societal biases affect human selections of robots in various professional settings, showcasing favoritism based on skin tone and stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether societal biases, such as occupational stereotypes and racial biases, influence the selection of artificial agents in professional environments.

Method: The study involved two experiments with 1,038 participants, exploring their preferences for robotic agents varying in skin tone and anthropomorphism across four professional domains. A second experiment assessed the impact of prior exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds on later robotic preferences.

Result: The findings indicate context-specific biases: lighter-skinned robots were favored in healthcare and education, while darker-toned robots were more accepted in construction and athletics. Participants' racial background influenced their decisions, and exposure to racialized human professionals affected subsequent robotic preferences.

Conclusion: The study shows that human biases transfer to human-robot interactions, potentially perpetuating social inequalities. This calls attention to addressing these biases in the deployment of robotic systems across professional settings.

Abstract: As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Force signals alone are inconsistent in identifying subtle subsurface features in soft-tissue environments during robotic palpation.

Method: Developing and experimenting with a compact multimodal sensor combining tactile imaging and a 6-axis force-torque sensor.

Result: Force signals are ambiguous, but tactile images provide detailed structural information. Combining modalities enhances detection and safe robotic palpation.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile imaging with force sensing improves subsurface feature detection and safe interaction during robotic palpation.

Abstract: Robotic palpation relies on force sensing, but force signals in soft-tissue environments are variable and cannot reliably reveal subtle subsurface features. We present a compact multimodal sensor that integrates high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging with a 6-axis force-torque sensor. In experiments on silicone phantoms with diverse subsurface tendon geometries, force signals alone frequently produce ambiguous responses, while tactile images reveal clear structural differences in presence, diameter, depth, crossings, and multiplicity. Yet accurate force tracking remains essential for maintaining safe, consistent contact during physiotherapeutic interaction. Preliminary results show that combining tactile and force modalities enables robust subsurface feature detection and controlled robotic palpation.

*Cheng-Yu Kuo,Hirofumi Shin,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses robotic hands' ability to regulate grasp force to prevent slippage during dynamic object interactions, using a novel tactile-driven energy abstraction method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of robotic hands regulating grasp force under unknown object properties, limited sensing, and absence of external sensing.

Method: A physics-informed energy abstraction models objects as virtual energy containers, combined with model-based learning and planning for energy dynamics through tactile sensing.

Result: The method enables robotic hands to learn grasp force control from scratch in minutes, reducing slippage and extending grasp duration across various conditions without external sensing.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves robotic manipulation by leveraging tactile-driven signals, providing a reliable approach to grasp force control under dynamic and uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.

Motivation: To improve robotic grasping performance by better aligning linguistic instructions with visual grasp reasoning, addressing limitations of weak semantic grounding in existing methods.

Method: Introduces LGGD using a CLIP-based hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline and a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH). It adopts a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm with a refinement module for improved grasp accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets in language-guided grasping tasks. Shows strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language instructions.

Conclusion: LGGD enhances semantic alignment and grasp accuracy, proving effective in real-world robotic manipulation tasks, with code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight 2-DoF arm on a quadrotor drone, achieving full 6-DoF control with reinforcement learning for robust aerial manipulation in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing lightweight aerial manipulators that balance simplicity and reduced payload while addressing challenges like underactuation and external disturbances.

Method: Using reinforcement learning (PPO) to train feedforward commands, integrated with INDI and PID controllers for accurate pose and manipulation control.

Result: Experiments show high precision in position and orientation control, robust performance despite disturbances.

Conclusion: Learning-based control strategies enable effective aerial manipulation with lightweight, simple designs.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators, which combine robotic arms with multi-rotor drones, face strict constraints on arm weight and mechanical complexity. In this work, we study a lightweight 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm mounted on a quadrotor via a differential mechanism, capable of full six-DoF end-effector pose control. While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets. These commands are tracked by an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) attitude controller and a PID joint controller, respectively. Flight experiments demonstrate centimeter-level position accuracy and degree-level orientation precision, with robust performance under external force disturbances. The results highlight the potential of learning-based control strategies for enabling contact-rich aerial manipulation using simple, lightweight platforms.

*Chen Liang,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces using Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives in MuJoCo MPC to replace finite differencing, significantly improving computational efficiency and performance, especially for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite differencing in MuJoCo MPC is often costly and inefficient, particularly in high-dimensional systems or complex scenes. The authors aim to optimize derivative computations to improve responsiveness in time-sensitive robotics tasks.

Method: The authors replaced the finite differencing approach in MuJoCo MPC with WASP derivatives, which compute efficient and stable derivative approximations by reusing prior computations. They evaluated this method across varied robot tasks.

Result: Using WASP, MuJoCo MPC achieved up to 2× speed improvements compared to finite differencing for derivative-based planners and better efficiency and reliability than stochastic sampling-based planners.

Conclusion: WASP derivatives enhance MuJoCo MPC's computational efficiency and reliability for Model Predictive Control tasks. The authors released a fully-integrated open-source implementation for broader use and further research.

Abstract: MuJoCo is a powerful and efficient physics simulator widely used in robotics. One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SparScene is a sparse graph learning framework for representing traffic scenes efficiently and scalably, addressing dynamic interactions between numerous agents and lanes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent trajectory generation methods suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues due to redundant edges from dense graph representations and overly complex networks.

Method: SparScene constructs sparse connections based on lane graph topology and uses a lightweight graph encoder to aggregate agent-map and agent-agent interactions effectively.

Result: SparScene achieves competitive performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, generating trajectories for over 200 agents in 5 ms and scaling to over 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes within 54 ms.

Conclusion: SparScene offers a scalable and efficient solution for representing and simulating complex traffic scenes, addressing current limitations in trajectory generation methods.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bio-inspired algorithm for drone swarms based on minimal local interaction rules, enabling transitions between collective motion styles and enhanced responsiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To draw inspiration from animal groups for designing efficient algorithms enabling autonomous aerial drone swarms with adaptability, flexibility, and resilience in complex environments.

Method: The researchers devised a 3D flocking algorithm where drones use minimal local interactions (alignment and attraction cues) with influential neighbors, and explored phase diagram transitions by tuning interaction gains.

Result: Simulations and outdoor experiments with drone swarms of ten showed that operating near critical transitions improves responsiveness to external disturbances, enabling behaviors like collective turns and transient expansions.

Conclusion: Minimal interaction rules generate diverse collective behaviors, and simple tuning of these rules offers a scalable way to optimize drone swarm flexibility and stability for various applications.

Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.

TL;DR: The paper presents Schrödinger's Navigator, a new framework for zero-shot object navigation in challenging environments, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to navigate and locate objects in unseen and cluttered environments, often with occlusions, risks, or dynamic targets, without prior task-specific training.

Method: Developed Schrödinger's Navigator framework utilizing trajectory-conditioned 3D world modeling to anticipate future observations based on visual inputs and candidate paths, updating navigation maps for intelligent decision-making.

Result: Demonstrated robust performance improvement in zero-shot object navigation across environments with occlusions, risks, and moving targets, consistently outperforming current baselines.

Conclusion: Trajectory-conditioned imagination improves navigation capability, making the proposed Schrödinger's Navigator effective for dynamic and occlusion-heavy scenarios.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

Result: The system demonstrated an average sensor error of 14.8 g and achieved 100% balance success during challenging tasks at a 3-degree surface inclination with optimized PID parameters.

Conclusion: Wireless CoP feedback effectively enhances postural stability in humanoid robots, ensuring precise and stable movement without compromising mechanical flexibility.

Abstract: Maintaining stability during the single-support phase is a fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics, particularly in dance robots that require complex maneuvers and high mechanical freedom. Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of insufficient large-scale robotic tactile data and misalignment between human and robotic tactile data, aiming to improve dexterous robotic manipulation.

Method: The researchers propose UniTacHand, which standardizes human and robotic tactile data using a 2D surface space from the MANO model and embeds it in a unified latent space via contrastive learning, trained on 10 minutes of paired data.

Result: The approach enables zero-shot human-to-robot tactile policy transfer that generalizes to unseen objects and achieves better performance and data efficiency when trained on a mix of human and robotic data.

Conclusion: UniTacHand provides a scalable and data-efficient framework for tactile-based robotic hands, advancing towards general-purpose dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "RoboCade," a gamified teleoperation platform for scalable and engaging collection of robot demonstration data to improve policy training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting human demonstration datasets for training autonomous robots is expensive and limiting due to the required sustained effort and resources.

Method: RoboCade employs gamification elements (e.g., visual feedback, sound effects, progress bars, leaderboards) in tasks involving remote teleoperation to engage and motivate users.

Result: Demonstration data collected via RoboCade improved robot policy success rates on target tasks by 16-56%, and user studies showed increased enjoyment (+24%) among novice users compared to non-gamified platforms.

Conclusion: Gamified data collection offers a scalable, accessible, and enjoyable solution for acquiring robot demonstration data beneficial for policy training.

Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a dominant approach for training autonomous robot policies. However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.

*Anatoly O. Onishchenko,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LookPlanGraph, a method for using dynamic scene graphs to improve task planning for robots in environments with changing conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning methods depend on static prebuilt scene graphs, which fail to adapt to environmental changes occurring during task execution.

Method: LookPlanGraph enhances the scene graph dynamically by incorporating updates from a Vision Language Model based on the robot's egocentric camera view.

Result: Experiments in simulated environments and real-world settings show LookPlanGraph outperforms static scene graph approaches. The GraSIF dataset is introduced for task validation.

Conclusion: LookPlanGraph enables more adaptable and efficient robotic task planning in dynamic, real-world environments compared to methods based on static models.

Abstract: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a natural language-based control framework for quadruped robots using Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving over 90% success rate in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional control systems for quadruped robots demand specialized expertise, limiting accessibility.

Method: A distributed architecture integrates LLMs to process natural language commands, which are translated into executable navigation commands using sensor fusion.

Result: Validation in indoor environments demonstrated a success rate exceeding 90% across diverse navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Offloading high-level planning to LLMs provides a feasible approach to intuitive interaction with quadruped robots in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

### [219] [Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07611)
*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces primitives for inspection planning that allow using neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) instead of explicit models, drastically reducing memory requirements while maintaining trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient inspection planning is essential given the aging and complex infrastructure that requires safe and thorough evaluations. Traditional sampling-based planners demand significant memory, especially for large, intricate structures.

Method: The paper proposes Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM). These primitives enable sampling-based planners to work directly with neural SDFs without relying on explicit environment models or costly transformations.

Result: The study shows that IPIM achieves similar quality inspection trajectories compared to state-of-the-art planners but uses up to 70 times less memory. Tests include scenarios with a large real-world structure containing over 92M triangular mesh faces.

Conclusion: IPIM enables memory-efficient inspection while maintaining high-quality results, offering a promising alternative to traditional inspection planners reliant on explicit models.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the decreasing awareness of the socio-organizational aspects of data-driven process analysis due to the increasing focus on technical elements.

Method: An inductive and deductive conceptualization approach is used to define process analytics dimensions, contrasted with a practical case study of data-driven process analysis implementation.

Result: The key dimensions of process analytics are explored and linked to socio-technical systems research, validated with insights from a real-life organizational case study.

Conclusion: Balancing technical, human, and organizational facets in process analysis provides a holistic view that enhances process analytics' effectiveness.

Abstract: Data-driven analysis of business processes has a long tradition in research. However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.

TL;DR: RepoNavigator improves repository-level issue localization by combining execution-aware tool design with RL training, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Locating modification points in large OSS repositories is difficult due to scale and complexity, and existing methods have limitations in handling code execution logic and tool usage.

Method: Introduces RepoNavigator, an LLM agent using a single tool for jumping to symbol definitions, trained end-to-end via RL directly from a pretrained model.

Result: RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with smaller models outperforming larger baselines and surpassing closed-source counterparts.

Conclusion: The study proves that integrating an execution-aware single tool with RL is an efficient, scalable method for enhancing OSS repository issue localization.

Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

TL;DR: Investigation into how LLMs adapt code generation strategies when exposed to test cases, identifying recurring adaptation strategies and how alignment pressures affect performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between pretraining objectives and alignment choices in code generation settings, specifically exploring tensions between using contextual signals and explicit instructions.

Method: Using BigCodeBench dataset, researchers analyze five LLMs under five prompting conditions with varying test visibility and restrictions, evaluating for correctness, similarity, size, and churn, to identify model behavior adaptations.

Result: Test visibility significantly alters performance; correctness doubles for some models. Explicit prohibitions or partial exposure only partly mitigate test signal influence. Recurring adaptation strategies arise; test-driven refinement is most frequent.

Conclusion: LLMs adapt strategies in response to contextual signals even when conflicting with explicit instructions, illuminating their reconciliation mechanisms between pretraining and alignment pressures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the software security expertise of five large language models (LLMs) using Bloom's Taxonomy to assess their cognitive performance in security-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the limitations and capabilities of LLMs in software security expertise and identify levels of comprehension, particularly regarding complex reasoning and secure system design.

Method: The authors assess five LLMs using various datasets across six dimensions of Bloom's Taxonomy, incorporating tests, vulnerable code analysis, real-world cases, and project-based tasks.

Result: LLMs excel at lower-level cognitive tasks like recalling facts and spotting vulnerabilities but struggle with higher-order reasoning and secure system design tasks. A software security knowledge boundary is proposed, along with 51 identified misconception patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in basic software security tasks but exhibit significant performance limitations in complex reasoning and design, indicating a need for further refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the brain processes language predictively using neural signals in Deaf signers, particularly differences caused by experience and disrupted stimuli.

Method: Decoding neural signals through coherence analysis with motion features derived from visual stimuli, combined with entropy-based feature selection to identify key neural signatures.

Result: Key neural features revealing linguistic comprehension include low-frequency coherence in distributed left-hemispheric and frontal areas, alongside correlations with age-dependent experience.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into predictive language processing and highlights a novel approach for analyzing experience-driven brain models using multimodal neural data.

Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method in active inference that selects actions based on expected information gain to optimize learning world models, using Bayesian Model Reduction and a discrete experimental paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize the learning process in world models by identifying outcomes that provide the most informational value about the model structure. This is crucial in scenarios where resolving uncertainty can greatly improve decision-making and experimental design.

Method: Active inference selects actions based on expected free energy involving information gain and value estimation. They utilize Bayesian Model Reduction to efficiently evaluate posterior beliefs about model parameters and determine actions that maximize information gain.

Result: This approach offers enhanced sampling efficiency during model learning by selecting actions that resolve the most uncertainty. The method is illustrated with the 'three-ball' paradigm to showcase improved model disambiguation and insight-generation processes.

Conclusion: The proposed method exemplifies how active reasoning can efficiently uncover structures of world models, offering a robust strategy for experimental design and decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

*Stefan Volz,Martin Storath,Andreas Weinmann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact and efficient algorithm for robust Least-Absolute-Deviations (LAD) line fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LAD line fitting methods, while robust to outliers, are computationally complex, lacking user-friendly, public implementations. Practitioners often rely on less exact or slower methods like LP-based or IRLS-based ones.

Method: The PALB method constructs piecewise-affine lower bounds using subgradients and applies a subdivision process for optimization. It ensures correctness and includes theoretical iteration limits.

Result: PALB showed empirical log-linear scalability, efficiently handling datasets with varied signal types, outliers, and even real-world data. It outperformed LP-based and IRLS-based solvers in speed and simplicity.

Conclusion: The PALB method is presented as an exact, practical, and faster alternative to existing LAD line fitting methods, supported by a publicly available Rust implementation with Python APIs.

Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.

Their score-based formulation offers a flexible way to learn conditional or joint distributions over parameters and observations, thereby providing a versatile solution to various modeling problems. In this tutorial review, we synthesize recent developments on diffusion models for SBI, covering design choices for training, inference, and evaluation. We highlight opportunities created by various concepts such as guidance, score composition, flow matching, consistency models, and joint modeling. Furthermore, we discuss how efficiency and statistical accuracy are affected by noise schedules, parameterizations, and samplers. Finally, we illustrate these concepts with case studies across parameter dimensionalities, simulation budgets, and model types, and outline open questions for future research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary and multiclass classification tasks, sensitive to observation-specific weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classification performance metrics do not account for the varying importance (weights) of individual observations, leading to an inability to distinguish classifiers based on their performance on high-importance cases.

Method: A weighted version of the Maths-based Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is developed for binary and multiclass classification. It ranges between -1 and 1 and incorporates weight sensitivity. Robustness proofs are provided regarding changes to weights.

Result: Weighted MCC prioritizes higher-weighted observations, distinguishing between classifiers with otherwise similar general performance. Demonstrations show weighted measures outperform unweighted ones in identifying classifiers performing better on important observations.

Conclusion: The weighted MCC is an effective metric to identify classifiers focusing on high-weight (critical) observations, offering robustness and precision over conventional unweighted metrics.

Abstract: Several performance measures are used to evaluate binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case
  and by a factor of $ε^2$ in the multiclass case.
  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP) to model sparse count data, especially for predicting infectious disease outbreaks in regions with zero historical cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a robust method to predict infectious disease outbreaks in geographically sparse and historically zero-count regions.

Method: The paper employs the PHIBP, leveraging statistical strength from related regions while addressing challenges posed by zero counts through absolute abundance-based modeling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate PHIBP's ability to generate coherent predictive distributions and enhance comparative epidemiological metrics like alpha and beta diversity.

Conclusion: PHIBP offers a unified framework for accurate outbreak predictions and yields meaningful insights into disease data in sparse settings.

Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of slow sampling and degraded generation quality in diffusion models caused by the delay in trajectory bifurcation during the reconstruction process.

Method: The authors propose Gaussianization preprocessing, which transforms training data to resemble an independent Gaussian distribution. This simplifies the model's learning process and enhances reconstruction quality in the early stages.

Result: The proposed Gaussianization preprocessing method improves the generative performance and enables more stable, efficient sampling, particularly with small-scale network architectures.

Conclusion: Gaussianization preprocessing enhances the performance of diffusion models by addressing trajectory bifurcation issues and maintaining high generation quality, broadening its applicability to various generative tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy constraints and platform restrictions that hinder traditional user-level path-based marketing attribution models.

Method: The CDA framework uses temporal causal discovery (PCMCI) and a Structural Causal Model to infer channel relationships and quantify their influence using aggregated data.

Result: On synthetic data replicating marketing dynamics, CDA achieved 9.50% relative RMSE with the true causal graph and 24.23% with the predicted graph, showing robust performance.

Conclusion: CDA offers a scalable, interpretable, and privacy-safe alternative to traditional attribution models, effectively capturing cross-channel interactions.

Abstract: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

TL;DR: CBCT imaging quality is improved via LIRE++, a deep learning reconstruction method offering rotational equivariance, multiscale reconstruction, and memory efficiency, showing promising results on synthetic and clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lower image quality of CBCT compared to CT limits its applications. Classical reconstruction methods have limitations, and deep learning methods face challenges such as lack of ground truth or clinical resolution requirements.

Method: Proposed LIRE++, an end-to-end multiscale and rotationally-equivariant learned scheme. Memory optimizations make it fast and efficient, while it is trained on synthetic data from a fast CBCT projection simulator.

Result: LIRE++ achieves 1 dB improvement in PSNR over deep learning baselines on synthetic data and improves clinical Mean Absolute Error by 10 HU compared to current proprietary hybrid methods.

Conclusion: LIRE++ shows promise for improving CBCT imaging quality through an efficient and effective deep learning approach, enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

*Artem Goncharov,Rajesh Ghosh,Hyou-Arm Joung,Dino Di Carlo,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an uncertainty quantification technique for computational point-of-care (POC) diagnostics to improve reliability, focusing on rapid Lyme disease testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based diagnostic models can produce errors and lead to misdiagnosis, necessitating an approach to enhance reliability and accuracy in POC diagnostics.

Method: A Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification was integrated into the computational diagnostics pipeline of a paper-based xVFA platform for Lyme disease.

Result: Using MCDO, the sensitivity of Lyme disease diagnosis improved from 88.2% to 95.7% through the exclusion of highly uncertain erroneous predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty quantification effectively enhances the robustness and reliability of neural network-based computational POC diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

### [234] [Fixed-time control with prescribed performance for path following of underwater gliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20748)
*Hanzhi Yang,Nina Mahmoudian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fixed-time prescribed performance control for underwater gliders to ensure accurate 3D path following under uncertainties and disturbances, validated as outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater gliders face challenges such as strong currents and turbulence during missions, risking navigation safety. The study aims to develop a control scheme that ensures robust and accurate path following under such conditions.

Method: The authors propose a control scheme combining a finite-time performance function and a fixed-time control framework, integrating it with a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer and an iLOS guidance law. The system constrains tracking errors within set bounds and enhances robustness with accurate disturbance estimation.

Result: Numerical simulations show superior performance of the proposed method compared to traditional controllers, with higher tracking accuracy, faster convergence, and smoother control efforts.

Conclusion: The control method is effective for robust underwater glider navigation, offering precision and resilience in challenging environments, addressing key risks while outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of controlling systems with complex nonlinear dynamics, focusing on improving efficiency and robustness while overcoming the limitations of sample inefficiency in traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Method: The proposed method combines SINDy to create a data-driven model of system dynamics and uses TD3 reinforcement learning. Synthetic rollouts based on the identified model are added to the reinforcement learning replay buffer to enhance policy learning with limited real-environment data.

Result: The framework is tested on a bi-rotor system for stabilization and trajectory tracking. Results show superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: This hybrid framework, integrating data-driven modeling and reinforcement learning, is demonstrated to be effective for controlling complex dynamical systems, representing an advancement in achieving efficient and robust control.

Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between AI model scaling and economic productivity, focusing on its impacts on various professional tasks.

Method: Conducted a preregistered experiment with over 500 professionals in different roles performing tasks using 13 LLMs, analyzing the effects of model progress and compute scaling.

Result: Found an 8% yearly productivity gain due to AI progress, attributing 56% to compute scaling and 44% to algorithmic advances, with stronger improvements in analytical tasks.

Conclusion: Scaling LLMs has the potential to increase U.S. productivity significantly, especially in non-agentic tasks, with a predicted 20% productivity boost over the next decade.

Abstract: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in industrial recommender systems through a framework called ReaSeq, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for explicit and implicit reasoning. The approach improves item representation and user interest modeling, leading to significant performance gains in real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome issues in recommender systems caused by dependence on log-driven methods, such as poor knowledge representation and inability to capture beyond-log user interests, by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

Method: ReaSeq utilizes reasoning via LLMs: explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning to enhance item representations with structured product knowledge, and implicit reasoning via Diffusion LLMs to predict beyond-log behaviors. Multi-agent collaboration and world knowledge play key roles in this framework.

Result: When deployed on Taobao's ranking system, ReaSeq demonstrated over 6% improvement in IPV and CTR, more than 2.9% in Orders, and above 2.5% in GMV, proving its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: ReaSeq significantly improves recommender systems by integrating world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, offering a superior alternative to traditional log-driven paradigms.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

*Andre Rusli,Miao Cao,Shoma Ishimoto,Sho Akiyama,Max Frenzel*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Japanese text-embedding approach to enhance C2C marketplace search efficiency, focusing on relevance and practical application within production constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C2C marketplaces like Mercari face retrieval challenges due to ambiguous queries, noisy user-generated content, and the need for optimized search within production constraints.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning embeddings on purchase-driven query-title pairs with role-specific prefixes, applying Matryoshka Representation Learning for compact and robust embeddings.

Result: Offline evaluations revealed notable gains in relevance, particularly with Matryoshka truncation; manual assessments indicated improved semantic handling, proper noun alignment, and term importance. Online tests showed improvements in revenue per user and search efficiency.

Conclusion: Domain-aware text embeddings enhance search relevance and efficiency, enabling scalable improvements and laying groundwork for advanced LLM-driven applications.

Abstract: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in fake news detection such as multimodal content complexity, domain generalization, and the lack of explainability, which are crucial for preserving online trust and integrity.

Method: The proposed method, AMPEND-LS, integrates signals from text, visuals, and context via a reasoning pipeline utilizing large language models (LLMs), along with additional techniques like reverse image search and credibility fusion mechanisms to enhance reliability. It also incorporates small language model (SLM) classifiers to improve robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances automated fake news detection towards more adaptive, explainable, and evidence-based systems, reinforcing online information integrity.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HiGeMine is a framework for hierarchical book genre classification, integrating user reviews and book blurbs while addressing noise and bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses shortcomings in traditional book genre classification methods, such as neglecting hierarchical structures, over-reliance on noisy user reviews, and the need for improved accuracy.

Method: HiGeMine employs a two-phase approach: filtering user reviews using zero-shot semantic alignment and utilizing a graph-based classification model with pretrained language models for hierarchical genre classification.

Result: HiGeMine outperformed existing methods in experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in hierarchical genre classification using both structured and unstructured data.

Conclusion: HiGeMine offers a novel, accurate, and systematic approach for genre classification, overcoming challenges in noise reduction and leveraging hierarchical structures effectively.

Abstract: Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

*Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Erin Connelly,Paul Breiding,Kathlén Kohn*

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: This paper explores optimization over algebraic varieties using degenerate quadratic objectives, highlighting key mathematical structures in overparametrized machine learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by challenges in machine learning when the model is overparametrized (i.e., more parameters than data), leading to a degenerate quadratic optimization landscape.

Method: The authors study the optimization problem using algebraic geometry tools, focusing on projection methods to relate degenerate and nondegenerate problems, and analyzing the ramification locus in highly-degenerate cases.

Result: A connection is established between degenerate and nondegenerate optimization problems using projections. Additionally, tools are developed to count critical points on projective varieties and applied to deep learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The research combines algebraic geometry with machine learning, offering insights into degenerate optimization landscapes and extending the theory of Euclidean distance degree to such settings.

Abstract: We study the critical points over an algebraic variety of an optimization problem defined by a quadratic objective that is degenerate. This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AirGS enhances free-viewpoint video (FVV) experiences by optimizing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) for high-quality, low-latency streaming with reduced storage and bandwidth requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4DGS approaches face constraints in long sequence quality degradation, high storage usage, and real-time applicability, necessitating improvements for scalable and efficient delivery.

Method: AirGS rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline, converts Gaussian streams to multi-channel 2D formats, identifies keyframes, combines temporal coherence with inflation loss, and optimizes Gaussian update transmission with integer linear programming and pruning.

Result: AirGS achieves improved PSNR consistency above 30, reduces quality deviation by 20%, accelerates training sixfold, and halves per-frame transmission size compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AirGS significantly advances FVV technologies by addressing quality, latency, and efficiency challenges, making it ideal for broader and real-time deployments.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

TL;DR: TexAvatars is introduced as a hybrid solution for creating 3D head avatars, combining geometric grounding and texel space continuity for improved generalization and high-fidelity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing approaches for 3D head avatars, particularly in generalizing to extreme expressions and poses for immersive AR/XR experiences.

Method: TexAvatars uses a hybrid approach combining analytic rigging and neural networks. It predicts attributes in UV space via CNNs while driving 3D deformations through mesh-aware Jacobians.

Result: TexAvatars achieves state-of-the-art performance in head reenactment tasks, including extreme poses and expressions. It captures detailed features like wrinkles and realistic mouth geometry.

Conclusion: TexAvatars improves generalization, stability, and interpretability, representing an advancement for realistic and expressive 3D avatars in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoBaxBuilder, a framework to autonomously generate tasks for evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, overcoming limitations of manually crafted benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are widely used in software engineering, it is critical to address their tendency to generate insecure code. Manual benchmarks are resource-intensive and inadequate for long-term application due to contamination risks, evolving tasks, and increasing difficulty demands.

Method: AutoBaxBuilder is proposed as an automated benchmark generation tool. It uses robust pipelines with LLM-driven plausibility checks to create functionality tests and security-oriented exploits, significantly reducing the need for manual input.

Result: The framework generated security benchmarking tasks efficiently, within 2 hours at low cost (less than USD 10). Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirmed the quality of these tasks compared to human expert-created tasks. A new benchmark (AutoBaxBench) was released.

Conclusion: AutoBaxBuilder offers a scalable, cost-effective solution to generate high-quality security benchmarks for LLMs. This approach enables continuous evaluation and improvement of LLMs' security capabilities, adapting to new challenges over time.

Abstract: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

Result: This study provides an in-depth analysis of advancements in fast finality protocols and identifies engineering constraints in single-slot versus multi-slot designs.

Conclusion: Improved fast finality protocols can mitigate existing latency issues in Ethereum while maintaining security, striking a balance between theoretical models and practical engineering concerns.

Abstract: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkFL-Health integrates Federated Learning (FL), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure privacy-preserving and verifiably correct collaborative training for healthcare AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy and trust challenges in data-sharing across institutions for healthcare AI.

Method: By combining Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Trusted Execution Environments, zkFL-Health allows local training and verifiable aggregation of updates while maintaining strong privacy and security protocols.

Result: The framework ensures confidentiality, data integrity, and auditability while supporting collaborative medical AI across institutions with robust security features.

Conclusion: zkFL-Health enhances privacy, trust, and regulatory compliance for healthcare AI through innovative integration of FL and cryptographic proofs.

Abstract: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

*Yifan Huang,Xiaojun Jia,Wenbo Guo,Yuqiang Sun,Yihao Huang,Chong Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPELL, a framework to test security vulnerabilities in language models for malicious code generation, revealing significant gaps in current AI safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research on malicious code generation as a target in jailbreak attacks against large language models.

Method: The authors developed SPELL, a framework using a time-division selection strategy to systematically generate jailbreaking prompts based on prior knowledge datasets.

Result: SPELL demonstrated high attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% on GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder, respectively, unveiling the models' susceptibility to malicious code generation.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical security weaknesses in advanced language models and emphasize the need for improved AI safety alignment in their applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

Motivation: To address the scalability and comprehensiveness limitations of manual red-teaming practices in evaluating LLM security in high-stakes domains.

Method: Proposed an automated framework that uses meta-prompting attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and evaluation protocols across six identified threat categories.

Result: The framework discovered 47 vulnerabilities (21 high-severity, 12 novel attack patterns) with a 3.9x improvement in discovery rate and 89% detection accuracy over manual methods.

Conclusion: The automated red-teaming framework significantly improves LLM vulnerability detection and supports building more secure and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, ensuring their security and alignment has become a critical challenge. Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel physical attack on RF-based drone detection systems using optimized baseband perturbations, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing detection accuracies via over-the-air experiments with standard equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing RF attacks on drone detection systems, particularly the challenges in converting digital perturbations to physical waveforms and maintaining standard hardware compatibility.

Method: The authors designed class-specific universal I/Q perturbation waveforms to be transmitted alongside legitimate signals and optimized them for physical drone detection systems.

Result: Results from RF recordings and OTA experiments with four drone types showed that these perturbations consistently reduced detection rates of target drones while ensuring legitimate drones' detectability remained unaffected.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduced a practical, hardware-compatible attack that demonstrates vulnerabilities in current RF image-based drone detection systems, emphasizing the need for more robust security measures.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Android datasets for function call graph-based malware detection are outdated, limited, and fail to capture real-world malware diversity, leading to unreliable evaluations and overfitting of graph classification methods.

Method: The authors developed the BCG dataset, which consists of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android APKs, spanning both benign and malicious samples. They provided graph-level features and conducted experiments to validate the dataset's utility.

Result: The BCG dataset outperformed existing datasets in malware classification experiments, demonstrating its higher quality and relevance for modern Android malware detection tasks.

Conclusion: BCG addresses critical limitations in Android FCG datasets, offering a reliable and effective resource for advancing research in graph-based malware detection for Android apps.

Abstract: Function call graphs (FCGs) have emerged as a powerful abstraction for malware detection, capturing the behavioral structure of applications beyond surface-level signatures. Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets. BCG is publicly available at https://erdemub.github.io/BCG-dataset.

*Haoyang Li,Xuyi Zhuang,Azmat Adnan,Ye Ni,Wei Rao,Shreyas Gopal,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: GenTSE introduces a novel two-stage generative language model for target speech extraction, achieving superior results in quality and intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in current TSE systems with improved generalization, high-fidelity speech generation, and better alignment between generated and ground-truth speech.

Method: The paper proposes GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only LM approach: (1) a semantic stage for generating coarse semantic tokens, and (2) an acoustic stage for generating fine acoustic tokens. It stabilizes decoding by separating semantics and acoustics, uses continuous embeddings for better context, and reduces exposure bias via Frozen-LM Conditioning and DPO.

Result: Experiments on Libri2Mix dataset show GenTSE outperforms previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Conclusion: GenTSE demonstrates that separating semantic and acoustic information within a two-stage LM approach enhances TSE performance, proving its capability in generating high-quality, intelligible, and content-aligned speech.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized framework for multi-agent decision-making that handles inconsistent beliefs, improves coordination, and triggers communication selectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents often operate under belief inconsistencies due to limited communication, leading to unsafe and suboptimal outcomes.

Method: A decentralized framework is developed for optimal joint action selection with probabilistic guarantees, which selectively triggers communication when required.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in simulation experiments.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective and safe multi-agent decision-making even under belief inconsistencies.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PINNBARDS, a Physics-Informed Neural Network tool to reconstruct hidden magnetic structures in the tachocline using synoptic magnetograms for improved flare-producing solar active region prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of predicting flare-producing solar active region emergence weeks in advance by reconstructing necessary magnetic state-vectors from surface observations.

Method: PINNBARDS employs Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) alongside MHD-SWT equations to deduce state-vectors from synoptic magnetograms.

Result: PINNBARDS successfully reconstructs tachocline state-vectors, yielding physically consistent toroids and identifies optimal toroidal fields (20-30 kG) for solar activity prediction.

Conclusion: PINNBARDS represents a pioneering approach to initializing MHD models for predicting solar active regions, potentially enabling early flare forecasting based on tachocline magnetic structure reconstruction.

Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.

*Yuan Qiu,Wolfgang Dahmen,Peng Chen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a variationally correct approach to neural operators by using FOSLS objectives and a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO), ensuring solution errors align with minimized PDE-residual losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for minimizing PDE-residual losses often lead to physically inconsistent results, as small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to non-compliant norms or improper penalties for boundary conditions.

Method: The authors propose the use of first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives that are variationally correct and derive a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO) for conforming reduced basis predictions. This ensures stability while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Their approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard methods and validates error estimates through numerical benchmarks.

Conclusion: By constructing a variationally correct framework and leveraging RBNO, this method overcomes inconsistencies of prior strategies while providing a rigorous error analysis and improved accuracy in numerical results.

Abstract: Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper presents a new paradigm, Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), for addressing multi-agent system challenges via economic principles, improving coordination and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges multi-agent systems face, namely the Hayekian Information and Hurwiczian Incentive problems, which make coordination computationally infeasible.

Method: A novel approach, Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), is introduced, utilizing Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) to compute incentive-compatible signals that ensure global optimization and scalability.

Result: The proposed framework is empirically shown to scale linearly with agents, avoids the complexity of traditional methods, and is 50 times faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion: MBI offers an efficient, auditable, trustworthy, and scalable solution for multi-agent coordination, rooted in economic principles.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems are fundamentally fragile: they struggle to solve the Hayekian Information problem (eliciting dispersed private knowledge) and the Hurwiczian Incentive problem (aligning local actions with global objectives), making coordination computationally intractable. I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple "brains", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \mathbf{G}_i = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. By structurally aligning agent self-interest with collective objectives, it provides a provably efficient, auditable and generalizable approach to coordinated, trustworthy and scalable multi-agent intelligence grounded in economic principles.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for multi-agent tasks using human-interpretable programmatic policies and Large Language Models for strategy adaptation, overcoming neural policy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of directly conditioning on opponents' opaque, high-dimensional neural strategies in multi-agent systems, enabling dynamic adaptation and interpretable policies.

Method: The paper proposes a paradigm where neural policies are represented as source code. Large Language Models (LLMs) act as interpreters, enabling policy optimization through Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), using textual gradients, game utility feedback, and unit tests.

Result: This approach effectively achieves dynamic adaptation in multi-agent tasks, successfully solving coordination matrix games and the cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

Conclusion: Utilizing LLMs for programmatic policy representation shows promise in operationalizing game-theoretic strategies, making policies interpretable and adaptable for multi-agent tasks.

Abstract: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores indirect reciprocity (IR) in human-AI interactions, particularly focusing on children and robots, combining experiments and modeling to examine strategies for cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to better understand trust and prosociality in human-AI interactions, as these are essential for effective teamwork in environments involving artificial agents.

Method: The authors conduct laboratory experiments and use theoretical modeling to analyze IR in interactions between children and robots, evaluating how artificial agents learn cooperative behavior.

Result: They find that indirect reciprocity applies to children-robot coordination dilemmas. Strategies used by children help multi-armed bandit algorithms learn cooperative actions.

Conclusion: Cooperation between humans and AI agents is influenced by human-provided strategies, and IR serves as a viable mechanism for fostering coordination in child-robot interactions.

Abstract: Social interactions increasingly involve artificial agents, such as conversational or collaborative bots. Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for identifying cybersickness in VR using EEG data and trained neural networks, focusing on auditory stimulus-processing features for enhanced classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve cybersickness classification during VR use by addressing confounding factors in existing EEG-based methods, particularly the interference of visual stimuli.

Method: The authors use trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models to analyze event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG data during cybersickness elicitation, employing interpretability maps to visualize key data features.

Result: The models consistently identified amplitudes near the left prefrontal cortex as critical for cybersickness classification, revealing a hidden feature for real-time application.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the scalp location near the left prefrontal cortex could improve cybersickness classification, opening pathways for better EEG-based measurement methods. Code for the method is provided.

Abstract: Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

Method: The study uses a multimethod quantitative approach, combining correlation analysis and text mining, conducted in real classroom settings where students interacted with AI tools.

Result: Middle school students show strong positive correlations between learning dimensions, indicating holistic evaluations, while high school students exhibit weak correlations, reflecting independent assessments.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize age-specific differences in perception of AI-mediated learning, suggesting tailored strategies for integrating AI based on developmental stages of learners.

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.

### [262] [Clever Hans in Chemistry: Chemist Style Signals Confound Activity Prediction on Public Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20924)
*Andrew D. Blevins,Ian K. Quigley*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The study reveals that machine learning models trained on literature data can predict chemists' goals and bioactivity by exploiting author-based information, not fundamental chemistry, and suggests ways to reduce this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether machine learning models exploit chemist intent and author-specific patterns from literature rather than genuinely learning chemistry-based structure-activity relationships, prompting concerns for biased predictions.

Method: The researchers linked molecular assays to publication authors, trained a classifier on molecular structure fingerprints, and developed an activity model using only author-probability vectors—excluding structural descriptors. They introduced author-disjoint dataset splitting to analyze data leakage causes.

Result: The author-aware classifier achieved 60% top-5 accuracy in predicting the chemist from molecular fingerprints. Similarly, an author-only model reached predictive accuracy for bioactivity comparable to baseline models that used structural data—exposing biases caused by chemist-specific patterns.

Conclusion: Machine learning models may exploit authorship-specific data, demonstrating a failure mode where predictions are influenced by chemist intent rather than underlying biological or chemical mechanisms, thus necessitating improved dataset splitting and labeling practices.

Abstract: Can machine learning models identify which chemist made a molecule from structure alone? If so, models trained on literature data may exploit chemist intent rather than learning causal structure-activity relationships. We test this by linking CHEMBL assays to publication authors and training a 1,815-class classifier to predict authors from molecular fingerprints, achieving 60% top-5 accuracy under scaffold-based splitting. We then train an activity model that receives only a protein identifier and an author-probability vector derived from structure, with no direct access to molecular descriptors. This author-only model achieves predictive power comparable to a simple baseline that has access to structure. This reveals a "Clever Hans" failure mode: models can predict bioactivity largely by inferring chemist goals and favorite targets without requiring a lab-independent understanding of chemistry. We analyze the sources of this leakage, propose author-disjoint splits, and recommend dataset practices to decouple chemist intent from biological outcomes.

### [263] [Declarative distributed broadcast using three-valued modal logic and semitopologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21137)
*Murdoch J. Gabbay*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to specify distributed algorithms using declarative axiomatic theories in modal logic, demonstrated through simple protocol examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a concise, human-readable way of specifying distributed algorithms that focus on essential properties rather than implementation details.

Method: Uses modal logic to axiomatize algorithms, capturing high-level properties while omitting low-level transitions, offering abstraction analogous to that of functional programming over imperative coding.

Result: The method was successfully demonstrated on simple protocols and even applied to find errors in an industrial protocol.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates better reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, simplifying both human- and machine-based verification and design refinement efforts.

Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.

*Caio Lins Peixoto,Daniel Csillag,Bernardo F. P. da Costa,Yuri F. Saporito*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a random gradient-free optimization method for functional optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, enabling fast convergence and provable guarantees while resolving practical computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in optimization over infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces where traditional methods often rely on finite-dimensional approximations that lack direct provable guarantees.

Method: Developed a gradient-free framework leveraging directional derivatives and a pre-basis rather than full bases or kernels, making computations tractable through forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation.

Result: Demonstrated the method's application in solving partial differential equations as seen in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), ensuring provable convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical and theoretically sound framework for functional optimization in infinite dimensional spaces, overcoming prior computational challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.

TL;DR: PhononBench evaluates the dynamical stability of 108,843 AI-generated crystal structures using phonon predictions, revealing that current models struggle with stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating the dynamical stability of AI-generated crystal structures and provide a benchmark for progress in material design.

Method: Leverage MatterSim interatomic potential for DFT-accurate phonon predictions and analyze stability across six crystal generation models.

Result: Dynamical stability of generated crystals is on average 25.83%, with MatterGen being the top-performing model at 41%. 28,119 stable structures are identified.

Conclusion: PhononBench highlights limitations in AI models for crystal generation and establishes an open-access benchmark aiding the creation of physically viable materials.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

*Ian Bounos,Pablo Groisman,Mariela Sued,Esteban Tabak*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to extract invariant features that predict a response variable while avoiding confounding influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of predicting a response variable without interference from confounding factors, ensuring unbiased predictions.

Method: The authors propose penalizing statistical dependence between features and confounders, using Optimal Transport theory and considering Gaussian cases to simplify implementation. Surrogates are used when confounders are unknown.

Result: The method provides a closed-form linear feature extraction process for Gaussian cases, generalizing to non-Gaussian and non-linear scenarios with few modifications.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively extracts confound-free features, offering a generalizable framework for handling complex dependencies in statistical learning.

Abstract: A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.

### [267] [Statistical and computational challenges in ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21111)
*Alexandra Carpentier,Nicolas Verzelen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses ranking experts by ability in an isotonic crowd-sourcing model and investigates computational-statistical gaps, focusing on efficient methods and showing relevant insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of ranking experts based on their correctness of answers using a general isotonic model, addressing computational and statistical efficiency in this context.

Method: The study models answer correctness statistically using isotonic matrix structures, analyzes computational-statistical efficiency, and uses low-degree polynomial methods in simplified sub-problems.

Result: It disproves computational-statistical gaps in expert ranking under the isotonic model and provides key algorithmic insights through sub-problem analysis.

Conclusion: The study establishes paths for optimal and efficient procedures in expert ranking and connects them to broader mathematical and computational principles.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.

### [268] [Graph Neural Networks for Source Detection: A Review and Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20657)
*Martin Sterchi,Nathan Brack,Lorenz Hilfiker*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the epidemic source detection problem and finds that they outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GNN-based methods truly excel in the epidemic source detection task compared to traditional techniques.

Method: Reviewed existing GNN-based methods, proposed a tailored GNN architecture for source detection, and conducted extensive experiments across various network types.

Result: GNNs consistently outperform all other tested methods across diverse networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in source detection.

Conclusion: GNNs are highly effective for epidemic source detection. The authors advocate using this task as a benchmark for evaluating GNN architectures and ensure reproducibility by releasing their data and code.

Abstract: The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.

### [269] [A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21166)
*Lei Wang,Darong Lai*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often fail to surpass traditional methods for link prediction due to insufficient learning of structural relationships. This paper proposes the Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework using community structure to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle to outperform heuristic methods in link prediction due to their focus on local node representations, which limits their ability to capture global structural relationships.

Method: CELP incorporates community structure through community-aware edge manipulation, confidence-guided adjustments, and the integration of multi-scale structural features to enhance both local and global graph topology.

Result: Experimental results show CELP's superior performance in link prediction tasks across multiple benchmark datasets, highlighting the importance of community structure.

Conclusion: By effectively combining local and global graph topology via community-aware strategies, CELP significantly improves link prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper discusses FEIBN, an intelligent networking framework for Industrial IoT (IIoT) utilizing federated learning and large language models for improved policy verification and reduced communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of frequent deployment and rollback of network strategies in IIoT systems due to coupled workflows, high downtime costs, privacy constraints, and the complexity of centralized policy verification.

Method: The authors propose FEIBN, which uses large language models to structure user intents and federated learning to verify network policies across IIoT nodes without exposing data. They introduce SSAFL, a mechanism to enhance efficiency by selecting task-relevant nodes and optimizing asynchronous uploads.

Result: Experiments prove that SSAFL improves model accuracy, speeds up convergence, and lowers cost by 27.8% compared to SemiAsyn.

Conclusion: FEIBN is effective in improving IIoT networking through distributed and privacy-preserving strategies, demonstrating better performance and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) offers a promising paradigm for intelligent and automated network control in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by translating high-level user intents into executable network strategies. However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.

Motivation: 6G wireless demands extremely high data rates, low latency, massive connectivity, and sustainable, energy-efficient functionality, which traditional CRNs fail to achieve effectively.

Method: The framework integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and genetic refinement for optimizing spectrum sensing, power allocation, bandwidth distribution, and RIS phase selection.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 25-30% energy savings, sensing AUC >0.90, and +6-13 percentage points improvement in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) compared to traditional and heuristic CRN methods.

Conclusion: This scalable green CRN solution lays a sustainable and effective foundation for 6G wireless applications, meeting energy efficiency and performance demands in IoT and vehicular networks.

Abstract: The 6G wireless aims at the Tb/s peak data rates are expected, a sub-millisecond latency, massive Internet of Things/vehicle connectivity, which requires sustainable access to audio over the air and energy-saving functionality. Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in optimizing real-time biomedical services for WBAN users using UAVs in IoMT, considering user mobility and task criticality.

Method: A hierarchical multi-scale Transformer model predicts user trajectories, combined with a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm for UAV optimization.

Result: Simulations and real-world data validate the proposed methods' effectiveness compared to other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating AI techniques and mobility predictions enhances IoMT solutions, achieving better task offloading and trajectory management for UAVs serving WBAN users.

Abstract: Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.
