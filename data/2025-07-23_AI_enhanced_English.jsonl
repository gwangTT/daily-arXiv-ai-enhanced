Our approach includes two\nkey designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes\nMLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,\nholding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated\npose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track\naction variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)\nDetail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware\nattention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background\nconsistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and\nfaithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first\ndataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.\nExperimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates\nharmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and\noutperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces HOComp, a novel method for seamless human-object interaction compositions, addressing shortcomings of existing techniques, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a new dataset, IHOC.", "motivation": "Existing image-guided composition methods often fail at achieving seamless human-object interactions while maintaining natural blending and consistent appearances.", "method": "The method involves two key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG) for identifying interaction types and providing pose constraints and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP) for maintaining consistent shapes, textures, and backgrounds.", "result": "HOComp generates harmonious human-object interactions, ensuring consistent appearances and surpassing existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.", "conclusion": "HOComp demonstrates a significant advancement in interaction-aware composition tasks, validated by the results on the newly proposed IHOC dataset."}}

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores inversion attacks on the internal states of LLMs, proving that inputs can be reconstructed more effectively than previously assumed.", "motivation": "To address privacy and safety concerns associated with exposing internal states (ISs) of LLMs during practices like collaborative inference and model auditing.", "method": "Four inversion attacks are proposed, including optimization-based white-box attacks, black-box attacks leveraging transferability, and a generation-based attack treating the task as translation.", "result": "Proposed methods successfully reconstruct inputs with high semantic and token-level similarity, including nearly perfect inversion of a 4,112-token medical prompt with an 86.88 F1 token matching rate.", "conclusion": "Current defenses are insufficient against ISs inversion attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust mitigation strategies."}}
