### [1] [The Ontological Neutrality Theorem: Why Neutral Ontological Substrates Must Be Pre-Causal and Pre-Normative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14271)
*Denise M. Case*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that creating a fully neutral ontology for shared data systems is impossible if it includes causal or normative commitments, as neutrality conflicts with divergent frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing data systems that accommodate accountability amidst conflicting legal, political, and analytic perspectives.

Method: The authors derive a theoretical impossibility result showing that neutrality in ontological design is incompatible with causal or normative assertions at the foundational level.

Result: The study demonstrates that neutral ontologies must avoid causal and normative commitments, and they can only include basic representations of entities, identity, and persistence.

Conclusion: Designing neutral ontological systems requires externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and causal/normative explanations, as a truly neutral shared substrate can only be pre-causal and pre-normative.

Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

### [2] [Epistemic Constitutionalism Or: how to avoid coherence bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14295)
*Michele Loi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explicit framework ('epistemic constitution') for regulating AI models' belief-formation processes, advocating for a Liberal approach to enhance epistemic governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concerns over large language models forming beliefs based on implicit, unexamined policies, particularly in addressing source attribution biases.

Method: The paper examines source attribution biases in large language models, distinguishes two epistemic approaches—Platonic and Liberal—and presents a conceptual framework of principles for epistemic governance.

Result: The analysis shows that large models enforce bias based on ideological coherence, which collapses under systematic testing, highlighting structured epistemic challenges.

Conclusion: The paper argues for a Liberal epistemic constitution, outlining principles for structuring AI epistemic governance similar to AI ethics frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

### [3] [VisTIRA: Closing the Image-Text Modality Gap in Visual Math Reasoning via Structured Tool Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14440)
*Saeed Khaki,Ashudeep Singh,Nima Safaei,Kamal Ginotra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge in vision-language models' mathematical reasoning due to a modality gap between text-based and image-based problems and introduces VisTIRA and improvement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with mathematical reasoning when presented with image-based problems due to limitations in reading dense formulas, layouts, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic contexts.

Method: The authors propose VisTIRA, a reasoning framework which decomposes math problems from images into natural language and Python steps, along with a LaTeX pipeline to generate image datasets for model training and evaluate performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, OCR grounding helps smaller models, and modality gap severity decreases with larger model sizes.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning frameworks and OCR-based grounding complement each other, helping reduce the modality gap in visual mathematical reasoning while larger models further mitigate the gap.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

### [4] [On the Generalization Gap in LLM Planning: Tests and Verifier-Reward RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14456)
*Valerio Belcamino,Nicholas Attolino,Alessio Capitanelli,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fine-tuned 1.7B-parameter LLM demonstrates high in-domain performance on PDDL planning tasks but fails in cross-domain generalization, highlighting reliance on domain-specific patterns over transferable planning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether fine-tuned LLMs show transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization in PDDL planning tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned an LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples across 10 IPC domains and evaluated its generalization using three diagnostic interventions (symbol anonymization, compact serialization, and verifier-reward fine-tuning).

Result: The model achieved 82.9% valid plans in in-domain tasks but failed (0% success) on unseen domains, showing dependence on surface representations and domain-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs encounter a generalization gap in planning tasks, with limited transferable competence. Diagnostic tools reveal the model's sensitivity to domain-specific patterns rather than true planning skills.

Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

### [5] ["Just in Time" World Modeling Supports Human Planning and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14514)
*Tony Chen,Sam Cheyette,Kelsey Allen,Joshua Tenenbaum,Kevin Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People efficiently employ simplified representations for mental simulation through a 'Just-in-Time' framework enabling effective reasoning and prediction without exceeding cognitive capacities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans abstract environments for mental simulations to reason effectively in complex situations, overcoming cognitive limitations.

Method: Developed a computational 'Just-in-Time' framework integrating simulation, visual search, and dynamic representation changes, tested in tasks like grid-world planning and physical reasoning.

Result: The model outperformed alternative approaches, yielding high-utility predictions by encoding minimal subsets of objects necessary for simulation.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence of an algorithmic process that allows humans to reduce representations for efficient and accurate simulation-based reasoning.

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

### [6] [Scalable Knee-Point Guided Activity Group Selection in Multi-Tree Genetic Programming for Dynamic Multi-Mode Project Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14485)
*Yuan Tian,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tackles the dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem by using genetic programming to enhance scalability with a group selection strategy and knee-point-based selection for activity-mode pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the scalability issues in the dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem while ensuring effective decision-making regarding activity order and modes.

Method: The authors employ genetic programming with a knee-point-based selection approach, integrating activity ordering and group selection rules, within a multi-tree framework.

Result: The proposed approach improves scalability and performs better than conventional methods in handling large-scale scheduling instances.

Conclusion: The new framework demonstrates its ability to manage large project scheduling instances effectively, advancing the state-of-the-art in scalable scheduling solutions.

Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

### [7] [Large Language Model-Powered Evolutionary Code Optimization on a Phylogenetic Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14523)
*Leyi Zhao,Weijie Huang,Yitong Guo,Jiang Bian,Chenghong Wang,Xuhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system designed for automated optimization of GPU-oriented algorithms using in-context reinforcement learning and a phylogenetic tree representation, leading to improved runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive and iterative nature of optimizing scientific computing algorithms for GPUs, coupled with underutilization of trajectory information in existing automated methods, motivated the development of a novel system for more efficient algorithm optimization.

Method: The authors developed PhyloEvolve, integrating Algorithm Distillation, prompt-based Decision Transformers, and a phylogenetic tree representation. This system uses in-context reinforcement learning to leverage trajectory information without retraining and applies elite trajectory pooling and multi-island parallel exploration for iterative optimization.

Result: PhyloEvolve demonstrated improved runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness on scientific computing applications like PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph studies compared to baseline and existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively automates GPU-oriented algorithm optimization using a novel approach that combines LLM techniques, in-context learning, and phylogenetic organization, offering notable improvements in performance and usability for scientific computing workloads.

Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

### [8] [MAS-Orchestra: Understanding and Improving Multi-Agent Reasoning Through Holistic Orchestration and Controlled Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14652)
*Zixuan Ke,Yifei Ming,Austin Xu,Ryan Chin,Xuan-Phi Nguyen,Prathyusha Jwalapuram,Semih Yavuz,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAS-Orchestra, a novel reinforcement learning framework for designing multi-agent systems (MAS), and MASBENCH, a benchmark to evaluate MAS performance. Results demonstrate that MAS effectiveness largely depends on task structure and other variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current multi-agent system designs, such as methodological complexity and uncertainty in performance benefits compared to single-agent systems.

Method: MAS-Orchestra formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem, abstracting sub-agents as callable functions. MASBENCH provides a controlled benchmark to characterize tasks along five key dimensions.

Result: The study shows that MAS-Orchestra outperforms single-agent systems and traditional MAS across various public benchmarks, though its benefits depend on specific task structures and agent capabilities.

Conclusion: MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH provide novel tools for improving MAS training and understanding, emphasizing that MAS benefits are task-dependent rather than universally applicable.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.

### [9] [Query-Efficient Agentic Graph Extraction Attacks on GraphRAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14662)
*Shuhua Yang,Jiahao Zhang,Yilong Wang,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the vulnerability of Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems, enabling reconstruction of hidden knowledge graphs under budget-constrained adversarial queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities in GraphRAG systems where adversaries may reconstruct hidden knowledge graphs leveraging budget-conscious attack strategies.

Method: The proposed method, AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), uses a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, an external graph memory, and a two-stage graph extraction combining lightweight discovery and LLM-based filtering.

Result: AGEA outperforms previous baseline attacks, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships across diverse datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness even under strict query limits.

Conclusion: GraphRAG systems are susceptible to adversarial extraction attacks, and improvements in security measures are necessary to prevent such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

### [10] [Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683)
*Aisvarya Adeseye,Jouni Isoaho,Seppo Virtanen,Mohammad Tahir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an anonymization framework using local LLMs to enhance privacy handling in qualitative research, outperforming human reviewers and automated tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and shortcomings of manual and automated anonymization in qualitative research, which often fails to capture context and poses privacy risks.

Method: The study introduces the Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) based on detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization using four strategies depending on risk level and identifier type.

Result: LLMs detected more sensitive data than human reviewers, with Phi achieving over 91% detection and maintaining 94.8% original sentiment accuracy.

Conclusion: Using local LLMs for context-aware anonymization enhances accuracy, reliability, and privacy protection in qualitative research, outperforming manual processes and rule-based tools.

Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

### [11] [IB-GRPO: Aligning LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation with Educational Objectives via Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14686)
*Shuai Wang,Yaoming Yang,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents IB-GRPO, a method using language models for generating personalized learning paths while addressing pedagogical constraints and multi-objective optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of creating personalized and effective long-term learning paths using language models, which face limitations like sparse feedback alignment with pedagogical goals, scarcity of expert data, and multi-objective interactions.

Method: The method combines hybrid expert demonstrations using Genetic Algorithms and teacher RL agents, alongside supervised fine-tuning of an LLM. It introduces a ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling and employs the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to manage multi-objective trade-offs.

Result: Experiments on datasets like ASSIST09 and Junyi, leveraging the KES simulator with the Qwen2.5-7B backbone, demonstrate improvements over existing reinforcement learning (RL) and large language model (LLM) approaches.

Conclusion: IB-GRPO successfully addresses challenges in LPR with a novel approach that achieves personalized learning and balances multiple objectives effectively.

Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

### [12] [Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691)
*Muhammad Khalifa,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Jaekyeom Kim,Sungryull Sohn,Yunxiang Zhang,Moontae Lee,Hao Peng,Lu Wang,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study shows that large language model (LLM) judges can be easily manipulated by tweaking the reasoning (chain-of-thought) provided by agents, potentially inflating performance evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability and robustness of LLM-based evaluations, especially in scenarios relying on agent-provided reasoning outcomes.

Method: The authors systematically rewrote agent chain-of-thought reasoning traces while keeping actions and observations constant, using style-based and content-based manipulation methods.

Result: Content-based manipulations successfully inflated false positive evaluation scores by up to 90%, and even advanced prompt designs and scaling of computational resources only partially mitigated this vulnerability.

Conclusion: LLM judges lack robust verification mechanisms for reasoning traces, necessitating new evaluation methods that cross-verify reasoning with observable evidence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses a benchmark, AutoDriDM, focusing on decision-making in autonomous driving, highlighting gaps in existing vision-language models' reasoning and decision alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks that emphasize perception over decision-making in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Development of AutoDriDM, a benchmark comprising 6,650 questions across three dimensions (Object, Scene, Decision) to evaluate and identify limitations in VLMs.

Result: Identified weak alignment between perception abilities and decision-making performance in current VLMs, with specific failure modes in logical reasoning.

Conclusion: AutoDriDM contributes to transitioning from perception-driven to decision-driven assessments in autonomous driving, advancing towards safer and more reliable VLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

Motivation: Advertisers face challenges in optimizing cumulative value under budget constraints, particularly in scenarios with few-shot data where traditional reinforcement learning struggles.

Method: The paper introduces GRPO-Adaptive, a post-training strategy to enhance LLM performance, and DARA, a dual-phase framework combining LLM reasoning and optimization for fine-grained decision-making.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing baselines in cumulative value optimization, tested on real-world and synthetic data environments.

Conclusion: DARA effectively integrates LLM in-context learning with precise optimization, addressing the challenges of AI-Generated Bidding under budget constraints in online advertising.

Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to explore ASP’s potential for explainable reasoning in connection to XAI, addressing its gaps and enhancing its utility for users.

Method: Analyzes types of ASP explanations and reviews current theories and tools from an XAI perspective.

Result: Highlights the inadequacy in coverage for certain explanatory settings and user questions in existing ASP explanation approaches.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative reasoning and problem solving approach in symbolic AI. Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

*Haizhou Liu,Haodong Jin,Yiming Wang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduced a Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method to enhance video browsing and extraction of key information by addressing limitations of GAN frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video summarization by overcoming unimodal feature dependency and unstable training issues in existing unsupervised GAN-based methods.

Method: The approach integrates a semantic alignment attention mechanism into a GAN framework, utilizes a Transformer-based generator, and applies incremental training to enhance video summary quality and training stability.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques in video summarization performance.

Conclusion: Semantic guidance and strategic training result in better video summaries and more stable training for unsupervised methods.

Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

### [17] [Towards Bound Consistency for the No-Overlap Constraint Using MDDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14784)
*Amaury Guichard,Laurent Michel,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work introduces the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint using a relaxed MDD approach, achieving significant reductions in search tree nodes and solving times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the NP-completeness of achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint by introducing a more effective filtering algorithm.

Method: The method involves deriving a bound-consistent algorithm using the no-overlap MDD, limiting the MDD width to control size and complexity, and implementing relaxed MDD-based filtering for no-overlap constraints.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed filtering reduces both search tree nodes and solving time compared to previous algorithms. It complements classical propagation methods for further efficiency.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel, effective bound-consistent algorithm for no-overlap constraints, demonstrating improved search efficiency and solution times.

Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

TL;DR: The paper presents CI4A, a semantic interface framework for agents that simplifies UI component interactions, achieving improved task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with handling low-level web component manipulations effectively, prompting the need to optimize interaction interfaces for agents.

Method: The researchers designed CI4A, a mechanism that encapsulates interaction logic of UI components into unified tool primitives, and built a hybrid agent with dynamic action space capabilities.

Result: CI4A integrated into Ant Design improved task success rates to 86.3% and demonstrated superior execution efficiency in the WebArena benchmark.

Conclusion: CI4A facilitates better performance in agent interaction tasks, providing a refined integration layer for complex UI components, offering a novel benchmark standard for future evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flat metrics fail to differentiate clinically minor and severe errors in VLM-based chest X-ray classification.

Method: The authors introduce hierarchical metrics, benchmark VLMs on taxonomy alignment, and propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings.

Result: Findings show that VLMs have abstraction errors but proposed methods can reduce severe errors to less than 2% while retaining performance.

Conclusion: Hierarchical evaluation and taxonomy-aligned representations are vital for safer and clinically useful VLM deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR&R) by addressing the challenges of integrating KR&R frameworks with imperative code.

Method: KRROOD introduces knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction via native class structures, merging the logic programming paradigm with OOP.

Result: KRROOD was evaluated using the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario, demonstrating strong performance and support for expressive reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates knowledge representation with OOP, enabling expressive and high-performing reasoning for autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces KRROOD, a framework designed to bridge the integration gap between modern software engineering and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR&R) systems. While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a neuro-symbolic method integrating Description Logic ontologies with neural networks for consistent predictions in domain knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance neuro-symbolic methods with support for Description Logic ontologies to improve prediction reliability and incorporate domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The method encodes a Description Logic ontology as a computational graph (circuit) to synthesize datasets, perform GPU-based reasoning, and guarantee ontology-consistent neuro-symbolic predictions.

Result: Results demonstrate the synthetic dataset aligns with ontology semantics, enables scalable deductive reasoning faster than existing tools, and improves neuro-symbolic classifier consistency with competitive performance.

Conclusion: The study bridges Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation by leveraging circuits for efficient ontology-based tasks, demonstrating practical uses in multiple real-world applications.

Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.
  Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.
  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.
  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.

### [22] [Just aware enough: Evaluating awareness across artificial systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14901)
*Nadine Meertens,Suet Lee,Ophelia Deroy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes shifting from assessing AI consciousness to evaluating awareness, introducing a practical method to assess awareness across various AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of agreement and methodological tractability in evaluating AI consciousness and moral status prompted the need for a practical approach focusing on awareness.

Method: The authors propose a structured, multidimensional evaluation framework to assess awareness, defined as a system's ability to process, store, and use information for goal-directed actions.

Result: They outline a scalable, domain-sensitive approach for comparing awareness profiles across varying AI systems, enabling task performance predictions and generalizing abilities for comparison.

Conclusion: This method supports design, oversight, and fosters better scientific and public discourse around AI systems by targeting awareness over consciousness.

Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

### [23] [Multi-Behavior Sequential Modeling with Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network for E-Commerce Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14955)
*Hanqi Jin,Gaoming Yang,Zhangming Chan,Yapeng Yuan,Longbin Li,Fei Sun,Yeqiu Yang,Jian Wu,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a method for modeling user behavior transitions in e-commerce interactions, offering high accuracy with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding diverse user behaviors and their transitions in e-commerce helps capture evolving preferences and user intent. Existing transformer-based approaches are computationally expensive, posing challenges for large-scale industrial applications.

Method: The proposed method, TGA, uses a structured sparse graph by identifying transitions at the item-level, category-level, and neighbor-level. It incorporates a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism for jointly modeling user-item interactions and transition types with linear complexity.

Result: TGA surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in performance while reducing computational costs. Moreover, it shows strong results when deployed in a production environment by improving business metrics.

Conclusion: TGA offers an effective, efficient solution for multi-behavior sequential modeling, making it suitable for large-scale implementation in e-commerce systems.

Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

*Fabio Morreale,Joan Serrà,Yuki Mistufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reconsiders Explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Barad's agential realism, emphasizing the contextual and relational aspects of interpretation instead of treating it as a purely technical problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge conventional assumptions in XAI, which focus on revealing AI's internal mechanics, by exploring a more holistic, context-driven understanding based on agential realism.

Method: The authors analyze existing XAI methods through Barad's framework, critique their onto-epistemological foundations, and propose design principles with a speculative text-to-music interface as an example.

Result: The study uncovers fundamental assumptions and limitations within established XAI methods and demonstrates how an agential realism approach enhances interpretation and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: Adopting a context- and relation-centered approach to XAI interpretation offers a more meaningful and ethically oriented framework for designing AI interfaces.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

### [25] [The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059)
*Oleg Romanchuk,Roman Bondar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modern CI/CD pipelines with agent-generated code can create a responsibility vacuum, where authority and epistemic capacity are mismatched, resulting in ritualized decision approvals rather than meaningful accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies structural challenges in scaled agent decision-making within CI/CD pipelines, focusing on mismatches between authority to approve decisions and the human ability to verify decisions meaningfully.

Method: The authors investigated decision-generation throughput, bounded human verification capacity, and scaling limitations in CI/CD pipelines with agent-generated code, highlighting inherent structural conditions rather than deviations or technical defects.

Result: The study demonstrates that beyond certain throughput thresholds, human verification becomes ineffective, leading to ritualized approvals based on proxy signals. Automation further widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding.

Conclusion: The responsibility vacuum persists unless organizational decision boundaries are fundamentally redesigned or responsibility is reassigned to batch- or system-level ownership.

Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for general agentic attribution, enabling better understanding of LLM-based agents' behaviors beyond failure attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research insufficiently explains the reasoning behind LLM-based agent behavior, despite increasing autonomy and deployment demands, raising accountability and governance concerns.

Method: A hierarchical framework combining temporal likelihood dynamics at the component level and perturbation-based analysis at the sentence level to analyze agent behavior.

Result: The framework effectively identifies critical historical events and textual evidence driving agent actions across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The study advances toward safer, more accountable agentic systems by improving understanding of LLM-based agents' decision drivers.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISE addresses "intent deviation" in tool-using LLM agents through a novel "Real-to-Virtual" method, achieving superior performance in task completion and intent alignment metrics compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with "intent deviation," impacting reliability and performance in tool-using agents. Current methods for addressing this issue either rely on costly manual data or suffer from distribution shifts, and lack tailored negative samples.

Method: RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories anchored on verified tools and generates diverse negative samples by mutating critical parameters. It employs two-stage training for intent alignment, leveraging synthetic data.

Result: RISE's synthesized data achieves improved metrics across user requirements, execution trajectories, and agent responses. It enhances task completion (up by 35.28%) and intent alignment (up by 23.27%), outperforming SOTA baselines significantly.

Conclusion: By mitigating intent deviation through virtual synthesis, RISE establishes a robust framework to improve the reliability and performance of LLMs in agent-related tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource inefficiency caused by users employing expensive AI models for tasks that simpler deterministic tools can handle effectively.

Method: The study involves defining the 'Plausibility Trap,' conducting micro-benchmarks and case studies to assess resource waste, and proposing frameworks for better tool selection.

Result: Quantitative findings demonstrate a significant efficiency loss (~6.5x latency penalty) and highlight algorithmic sycophancy risks.

Conclusion: A curriculum shift is necessary to teach users when not to employ Generative AI, supporting resource-efficient tool utilization.

Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

Motivation: To maximize customer requests served within a finite time horizon in the vehicle routing problem, addressing current inefficiencies in performance and solution time.

Method: Developed a novel routing network embedding module with local node embeddings and a context-aware global graph representation, integrated into a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning framework.

Result: The method demonstrates a higher customer service rate and shorter solution times compared to existing methods, validated on real-world and synthetic networks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach proves effective for solving vehicle routing problems with a finite time horizon, outperforming prior methods in service efficiency and computational time.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon. In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.

Result: Through testing in five scenarios with 12 evaluators, the AI agent demonstrated a 206% improvement in output quality and achieved expert-level ratings while maintaining high-quality, consistent code.

Conclusion: The study shows that the proposed framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level visualization outcomes, effectively converting tacit expert knowledge into actionable AI capabilities.

Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

### [31] [Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160)
*Yuval Kansal,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes a learning paradigm using knowledge graphs to enhance reasoning capabilities in domain-specific tasks, outperforming larger models in complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with specialized compositional multi-hop reasoning in scientific fields.

Method: Combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, leveraging knowledge graphs for structured and verifiable reward signals.

Result: The model trained with path-derived rewards achieved superior zero-shot generalization and robustness compared to frontier systems (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro).

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning in structured domain-specific knowledge is efficient and scalable for improving intelligent reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

*Shijie Lian,Bin Yu,Xiaopeng Lin,Laurence T. Yang,Zhaolong Shen,Changti Wu,Yuzhuo Miao,Cong Huang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vision-Language-Action models for robot manipulation often fail to generalize due to dataset biases that prioritize visual information, ignoring language constraints. BayesianVLA addresses this by optimizing models to better ground language in action, achieving improved generalization without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robot manipulation, which suffer from biases in training data where visual observations overshadow language instructions, leading to failure in complex scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes BayesianVLA, a framework using Bayesian decomposition with learnable Latent Action Queries. It builds a dual-branch architecture to optimize conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions, countering visual data bias.

Result: BayesianVLA notably improves model performance in generalizations, achieving an 11.3% improvement on an OOD benchmark (SimplerEnv), showcasing effectiveness across SimplerEnv and RoboCasa environments.

Conclusion: BayesianVLA enhances the instruction-following capability of VLA models without requiring new datasets, proving its effectiveness in addressing dataset bias and improving language-grounded robot manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

*Xiaoxuan Yang,Peilin Chen,Tergel Molom-Ochir,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes processing-in-memory techniques to solve inefficiencies in Transformer models, enhancing scaling and reducing latency, memory bottlenecks, and energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in Transformer deployment at scale, such as high latency, memory bottlenecks in long-context inference, and inefficient quadratic attention complexity.

Method: The proposed methods include restructuring computations to minimize data transfers, compressing/pruning KV cache, and reinterpreting attention as associative memory to lower complexity and hardware footprint.

Result: The processing-in-memory design significantly improves energy efficiency and reduces latency in comparison to current accelerators and GPUs.

Conclusion: The solutions proposed in this paper provide effective computational, memory, and scalability improvements, enabling efficient acceleration of Transformer models.

Abstract: Transformers have become central to natural language processing and large language models, but their deployment at scale faces three major challenges. First, the attention mechanism requires massive matrix multiplications and frequent movement of intermediate results between memory and compute units, leading to high latency and energy costs. Second, in long-context inference, the key-value cache (KV cache) can grow unpredictably and even surpass the model's weight size, creating severe memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Third, the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to sequence length amplifies both data movement and compute overhead, making large-scale inference inefficient. To address these issues, this work introduces processing-in-memory solutions that restructure attention and feed-forward computation to minimize off-chip data transfers, dynamically compress and prune the KV cache to manage memory growth, and reinterpret attention as an associative memory operation to reduce complexity and hardware footprint. Moreover, we evaluate our processing-in-memory design against state-of-the-art accelerators and general-purpose GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency. Together, these approaches address computation overhead, memory scalability, and attention complexity, further enabling efficient, end-to-end acceleration of Transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address manufacturing challenges and complexity in advanced semiconductor processes, particularly with 3D chiplets for improved reliability, yield, and cost-efficiency.

Method: The COIN-3D project aims to create open-source EDA tools for 3D VLSI reliability assessment, combining algorithms for both physical- and system-level analysis.

Result: Development of EDA tools for analyzing 3D systems' reliability, facilitating research and design in heterogeneous chiplet-based systems.

Conclusion: The project focuses on enhancing 2.5D/3D VLSI reliability through collaborative research and enabling effective design solutions via novel tools.

Abstract: As semiconductor manufacturing advances from the 3-nm process toward the sub-nanometer regime and transitions from FinFETs to gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFETs), the resulting complexity and manufacturing challenges continue to increase. In this context, 3D chiplet-based approaches have emerged as key enablers to address these limitations while exploiting the expanded design space. Specifically, chiplets help address the lower yields typically associated with large monolithic designs. This paradigm enables the modular design of heterogeneous systems consisting of multiple chiplets (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory) fabricated using different technology nodes and processes. Consequently, it offers a capable and cost-effective strategy for designing heterogeneous systems. This paper introduces the Horizon Europe Twinning project COIN-3D (Collaborative Innovation in 3D VLSI Reliability), which aims to strengthen research excellence in 2.5D/3D VLSI systems reliability through collaboration between leading European institutions. More specifically, our primary scientific goal is the provision of novel open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for reliability assessment of 3D systems, integrating advanced algorithms for physical- and system-level reliability analysis.

TL;DR: PAF is an open-source framework that simplifies FPGA-based network functionality deployment by enabling efficient parameterization and optimized pipelined designs across multiple FPGAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for scalable, low-latency infrastructures in cloud services is hindered by the slow FPGA design process, making it difficult to adapt to dynamic requirements and heterogeneous hardware.

Method: PAF employs a pipeline-oriented design methodology using Chisel, a hardware construction language, to efficiently parameterize FPGA designs and focus on architectural intent.

Result: PAF streamlines design reuse and optimization while reducing coding complexity. It maintains performance and resource efficiency comparable to manually exhaustive implementations.

Conclusion: PAF demonstrates that automation facilitates FPGA design across diverse targets without sacrificing control, performance, or efficiency, addressing challenges in network infrastructure deployment.

Abstract: In a context of ever-growing worldwide communication traffic, cloud service providers aim at deploying scalable infrastructures to address heterogeneous needs. Part of the network infrastructure, FPGAs are tailored to guarantee low-latency and high-throughput packet processing. However, slowness of the hardware design process impairs FPGA ability to be part of an agile infrastructure under constant evolution, from incident response to long-term transformation. Deploying and maintaining network functionalities across a wide variety of FPGAs raises the need to fine-tune hardware designs for several FPGA targets. To address this issue, we introduce PAF, an open-source architectural parameterization framework based on a pipeline-oriented design methodology. PAF (Pipeline Automation Framework) implementation is based on Chisel, a Scala-embedded Hardware Construction Language (HCL), that we leverage to interface with circuit elaboration. Applied to industrial network packet classification systems, PAF demonstrates efficient parameterization abilities, enabling to reuse and optimize the same pipelined design on several FPGAs. In addition, PAF focuses the pipeline description on the architectural intent, incidentally reducing the number of lines of code to express complex functionalities. Finally, PAF confirms that automation does not imply any loss of tight control on the architecture by achieving on par performance and resource usage with equivalent exhaustively described implementations.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Joseph Shaw,Bowen Sun,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI system to reliably transform complex biomedical PDFs into structured evidence for synthesis purposes, solving issues like OCR errors and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical evidence synthesis requires the extraction of vital data from complex scientific PDFs, but manual processes are time-consuming and inefficient, leading to a need for scalable and error-resistant automation.

Method: The authors developed a pipeline combining typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence gating to analyze PDFs. The process includes hashing, chunk partitioning, conflict-aware merging, and provenance-aware aggregation.

Result: The AI system effectively processed all tested biomedical PDFs without manual intervention, improved variable extraction fidelity, and demonstrated robustness, consistency, and auditability.

Conclusion: Schema-constrained AI with provenance-aware features enables automated, scalable, and auditable extraction of biomedical data, addressing critical needs in evidence synthesis reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Biomedical evidence synthesis relies on accurate extraction of methodological, laboratory, and outcome variables from full-text research articles, yet these variables are embedded in complex scientific PDFs that make manual abstraction time-consuming and difficult to scale. Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.

*Youyou Cheng,Zhuangwei Kang,Kerry Jiang,Chenyu Sun,Qiyang Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in large language models during multi-turn dialogues in mental health support, proposing a stress-testing framework to evaluate their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of single-turn safety evaluations for LLMs in mental health support, recognizing the real dangers posed by gradual boundary transgressions in long dialogues.

Method: The authors devised a multi-turn stress-testing framework and tested three LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing, across 50 virtual patient profiles.

Result: Violations frequently occurred, with adaptive probing advancing boundary breaches earlier (average 4.64 turns) compared to static progression (average 9.21 turns). Definitive promises and zero-risk assurances were primary violations.

Conclusion: The robustness of LLM safety boundaries requires evaluating multi-turn interactions rather than relying solely on single-turn tests, accounting for wear and tear during extended dialogues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.
  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.

Finally, we highlight five research directions for future mechanistic studies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework to minimize hallucinations in generating educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using large language models, achieving >90% improvement in reducing hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of hallucinations in LLM-generated educational MCQs undermines the reliability of such tools, necessitating a structured approach to enhance content validity and quality.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent framework combining rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, hallucination scoring metrics, counterfactual reasoning, and chain-of-thought (CoT) refinement.

Result: The framework significantly reduced hallucination rates by over 90% in AP-aligned STEM question samples while maintaining educational value and stylistic integrity.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent collaboration effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, enabling scalable, reliable educational MCQ generation, and improving LLM-powered learning tools.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), defined as fluent yet incorrect or incoherent outputs, pose a significant challenge to the automatic generation of educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We identified four key hallucination types in MCQ generation: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent collaboration can mitigate hallucinations in educational content creation at scale, paving the way for more reliable LLM-powered learning tools.

Method: A large-scale QA benchmark was built using review-rebuttal exchanges from computer science papers, with 15K human-verified QA pairs. A taxonomy aligned with scientific research flow and a scalable evaluation framework were developed.

Result: Even robust models like GPT-5 scored 68.2% in correctness-completeness and dropped to 37.46% in conciseness-adjusted assessments, demonstrating significant limitations in understanding academic content.

Conclusion: RPC-Bench provides essential tools and insights for improving the evaluation of foundation models’ understanding of scientific papers, emphasizing the need for advancements in this area.

Abstract: Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes when and how human cognition affects semantic behavior by using Reddit data, revealing circadian rhythms in linguistic exploration and showing how biological clocks influence high-dimensional language use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human cognition's circadian rhythms affect language use and semantic behavior, a dimension not clearly studied before.

Method: Analyzed large-scale Reddit data, embedded text into a pretrained transformer model, and used semantic entropy to quantify linguistic exploration-exploitation rhythms modulated by circadian cues.

Result: Found a temporal dissociation in semantic behavior: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, while global diversity rises later in the day, aligning with known diurnal cognitive patterns.

Conclusion: Biological circadian rhythms extend to influence semantic behavior, independent of mood-related factors, and provide insights into the temporal structure of human cognition.

Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method called Verifier-Guided Distillation to improve performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) by training them on reasoning processes that include errors and self-corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs, with under 10B parameters, are appealing for private and on-device applications but struggle with strict constraint-satisfaction due to their overconfident, linear reasoning styles that fail to self-correct.

Method: Verifier-Guided Distillation trains a 7B model on reasoning traces, including errors and corrections, enabling the model to develop latent verification behavior for detecting and correcting contradictions.

Result: The method shows the emergence of verification behavior in small models, allowing them to occasionally identify and revise contradictions in their reasoning processes.

Conclusion: Verifier-Guided Distillation allows SLMs to improve their reasoning by adopting error repair mechanisms, making them better suited for constraint-satisfaction tasks.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, under 10B parameters) are attractive for private, on-device deployment, yet they frequently fail on strict constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear, overconfident reasoning traces that do not recover from early mistakes. We introduce Verifier-Guided Distillation, a training protocol that transfers the process of error repair - explicit conflict detection and backtracking - rather than only correct final answers. By training a 7B model on verified reasoning traces that include mistakes and self-corrections, we show that latent verification behavior can emerge in small models, enabling them to occasionally stop, detect contradictions, and revise earlier assumptions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Plan-Critic model, improving instruction-following quality for autoregressive (AR) audio generators while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models excel in generating coherent audio but struggle with complex textual prompts, necessitating improved planning and instruction-following.

Method: The authors propose the Plan-Critic model, which uses a GAE-inspired objective to predict instruction-following quality from early tokens, guiding trajectory exploration during inference.

Result: Plan-Critic achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over AR baselines in text-to-audio generation while maintaining computational parity.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that AR models can achieve effective global semantic planning through prefix evaluation, advancing text-to-audio generation. This bridges causal generation and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines enhancing accent control in text-to-speech (TTS) systems using linguistically motivated phonological rules alongside speaker embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address limitations in current TTS systems which rely on speaker embeddings for accent generation, as these embeddings lack interpretability and controllability by encoding multiple traits like emotion and timbre.

Method: Using American and British English, phonological rules such as flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences were implemented. A novel metric, phoneme shift rate (PSR), was introduced to quantify the interaction between embeddings and rule-based transformations.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that combining phonological rules with embeddings produces more authentic accented speech and reveals an interrelation between accent and speaker identity.

Conclusion: Incorporating rules offers a powerful means of controlling accents and provides a framework for disentangling accent and speaker identity in speech synthesis systems.

Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

We developed a model- and task-agnostic framework for designing human-LLM qualitative analysis methods to support diverse analytic aims. Within a multi-site study of diabetes care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), we leveraged the framework to implement human-LLM methods for (1) qualitative synthesis of researcher-generated summaries to produce comparative feedback reports and (2) deductive coding of 167 interview transcripts to refine a practice-transformation intervention. LLM assistance enabled timely feedback to practitioners and the incorporation of large-scale qualitative data to inform theory and practice changes. This work demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into applied health-services research to enhance efficiency while preserving rigor, offering guidance for continued innovation with LLMs in qualitative research.

### [46] [Can LLM Reasoning Be Trusted? A Comparative Study: Using Human Benchmarking on Statistical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14479)
*Crish Nagarkar,Leonid Bogachev,Serge Sharoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the statistical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), fine-tunes them for improved competence, and demonstrates their potential in automated assessment and education technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the statistical reasoning abilities of LLMs, while assessing their performance in judging answer quality compared to traditional metrics.

Method: Fine-tuning selected open-source LLMs on a custom-developed dataset designed for statistical reasoning tasks and benchmarking against human scores.

Result: Fine-tuned models exhibit improved performance in advanced statistical tasks comparable to statistics students, with some models showing significant benefits. LLMs were effective in self-evaluating answer reasoning and explanations.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning enhances LLMs’ statistical reasoning abilities and self-evaluation skills, showing strong applicability for educational technologies, research validation, and data analysis workflow quality control.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve statistical tasks, as well as their capacity to assess the quality of reasoning. While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a range of NLP tasks, their competence in addressing even moderately complex statistical challenges is not well understood. We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore. This self-evaluation capability enables scalable automated assessment for statistical education platforms and quality assurance in automated analysis tools. Potential applications also include validation tools for research methodology in academic and industry settings, and quality control mechanisms for data analysis workflows.

*Jinhui Liu,Ximeng Zhang,Yanbo Ai,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating realistic business-context data to evaluate Text-to-SQL agents in BI environments effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic, domain-specific data for evaluating Text-to-SQL agents in BI settings.

Method: Developed a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework incorporating personas, work scenarios, workflows, and reasoning complexity control.

Result: The synthesized data showcases high business realism (98.44%) and outperforms existing methods like OmniSQL and SQL-Factory while revealing significant performance gaps in current Text-to-SQL models.

Conclusion: The framework advances synthetic evaluation techniques, improves data realism, and highlights challenges in Text-to-SQL models' performance on complex queries.

Abstract: Evaluating Text-to-SQL agents in private business intelligence (BI) settings is challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, domain-specific data. While synthetic evaluation data offers a scalable solution, existing generation methods fail to capture business realism--whether questions reflect realistic business logic and workflows. We propose a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework that generates data grounded in business personas, work scenarios, and workflows. In addition, we improve the data quality by imposing a business reasoning complexity control strategy that diversifies the analytical reasoning steps required to answer the questions. Experiments on a production-scale Salesforce database show that our synthesized data achieves high business realism (98.44%), substantially outperforming OmniSQL (+19.5%) and SQL-Factory (+54.7%), while maintaining strong question-SQL alignment (98.59%). Our synthetic data also reveals that state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL models still have significant performance gaps, achieving only 42.86% execution accuracy on the most complex business queries.

*Chenglei Si,Zitong Yang,Yejin Choi,Emmanuel Candès,Diyi Yang,Tatsunori Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores automated AI research using execution feedback to test LLM ideas, analyzing evolutionary search and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the feasibility of automated execution for AI research and the ability of LLMs to learn from execution feedback.

Method: Build an automated executor for large-scale experiments, convert research problems to execution environments, and evaluate feedback-driven learning techniques like evolutionary search and reinforcement learning.

Result: Execution-driven evolutionary search significantly improves performance on post-training (69.4% vs 48.0%) and pre-training efficiency (19.7 min vs 35.9 min), while reinforcement learning struggles due to mode collapse.

Conclusion: Execution-grounded approaches have potential for automated AI research, but require refined methods to avoid limitations like early saturation and mode collapse.

Abstract: Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.

### [49] [Self-Blinding and Counterfactual Self-Simulation Mitigate Biases and Sycophancy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14553)
*Brian Christian,Matan Mazor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) exhibit challenges in counterfactual reasoning when aiming to eliminate gender and racial biases but proposes using self-replication methods (blind replicas) to improve fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenge of creating unbiased and fair decision-making processes, as both humans and LLMs struggle with bias due to irrelevant information such as gender or race.

Method: The researchers evaluated the ability of LLMs to ignore biasing information in decision-making by simulating counterfactual reasoning. They explored prompt methods and the use of a replica API to improve fairness.

Result: LLMs failed to offset biases through ignoring or pretending not to know biasing information. However, replicating counterfactual reasoning via a blinded replica API resulted in fairer outcomes.

Conclusion: Access to a ground-truth model through a replica API improves fairness in LLM decision-making, offering transparency and better handling of biases compared to conventional prompting methods.

Abstract: Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.

### [50] [Rewarding How Models Think Pedagogically: Integrating Pedagogical Reasoning and Thinking Rewards for LLMs in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14560)
*Unggi Lee,Jiyeong Bae,Jaehyeon Park,Haeun Park,Taejun Park,Younghoon Jeon,Sungmin Cho,Junbo Koh,Yeil Jeong,Gyeonggeon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework to enhance LLMs as tutors by including educational theory-based reasoning prompts and a reinforcement-learning-based thinking reward system, showing improved pedagogical behavior and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize LLMs for educational contexts by addressing limitations in their internal reasoning for intelligent tutoring, rather than focusing solely on optimizing visible responses.

Method: The framework includes (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting based on domain-specific educational theories and (2) Thinking Reward to evaluate and enhance reasoning pedagogical quality through reinforcement learning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that theory-based prompting outperforms generic approaches, and combining it with Thinking Reward significantly enhances pedagogical reasoning, systematic thinking, and benchmark performances.

Conclusion: Incorporating educational principles into the internal reasoning and reinforcement learning process of LLM tutors improves their reasoning, teaching methodologies, and overall effectiveness in educational contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutoring systems, yet research on optimizing LLMs specifically for educational contexts remains limited. Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Social Caption framework to evaluate multimodal large language models' abilities to understand social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social interactions is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of multimodal large language models.

Method: The paper introduces Social Caption, structured around interaction theory, to evaluate social understanding abilities via Social Inference, Holistic Social Analysis, and Directed Social Analysis.

Result: It provides insights into how factors like model scale, architecture, and spoken context influence the social understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

Conclusion: The framework offers valuable methods for assessing MLLMs' social understanding abilities and scaling automated evaluation systems for multimodal interaction analysis.

Abstract: Social understanding abilities are crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret human social interactions. We introduce Social Caption, a framework grounded in interaction theory to evaluate social understanding abilities of MLLMs along three dimensions: Social Inference (SI), the ability to make accurate inferences about interactions; Holistic Social Analysis (HSA), the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of interactions; Directed Social Analysis (DSA), the ability to extract relevant social information from interactions. We analyze factors influencing model performance in social understanding, such as scale, architectural design, and spoken context. Experiments with MLLM judges contribute insights about scaling automated evaluation of multimodal social understanding.

*Xichen Zhang,Ziyi He,Yinghao Zhu,Sitong Wu,Shaozuo Yu,Meng Chu,Wenhu Zhang,Haoru Tan,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SearchGym, a simulation environment to train search agents for reasoning tasks effectively using RL, addressing cost and data alignment issues in current training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve issues with training search agents using RL, which include high costs of API interactions and data misalignment in static datasets causing corrupted rewards and unstable training.

Method: SearchGym is proposed as a controlled simulation environment with a generative pipeline for creating a verifiable knowledge graph and aligned documents, along with SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning method for progressive policy optimization.

Result: SearchGym demonstrates strong simulation-to-reality performance generalization; Qwen2.5-7B-Base outperforms web-enhanced baselines by 10.6% across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation in controlled environments like SearchGym is a scalable, cost-effective approach to train competent search agents for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Search agents have emerged as a pivotal paradigm for solving open-ended, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, training these agents via Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces a critical dilemma: interacting with live commercial Web APIs is prohibitively expensive, while relying on static data snapshots often introduces noise due to data misalignment. This misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination. To address this, we propose SearchGym, a simulation environment designed to bootstrap robust search agents. SearchGym employs a rigorous generative pipeline to construct a verifiable knowledge graph and an aligned document corpus, ensuring that every reasoning task is factually grounded and strictly solvable. Building on this controllable environment, we introduce SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning methodology that progressively optimizes agent policies through purified feedback, evolving from basic interactions to complex, long-horizon planning. Extensive experiments across the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate strong Sim-to-Real generalization. Notably, our Qwen2.5-7B-Base model trained within SearchGym surpasses the web-enhanced ASearcher baseline across nine diverse benchmarks by an average relative margin of 10.6%. Our results validate that high-fidelity simulation serves as a scalable and highly cost-effective methodology for developing capable search agents.

### [53] [Say Anything but This: When Tokenizer Betrays Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658)
*Navid Ayoobi,Marcus I Armstrong,Arjun Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can fail reasoning due to non-unique subword tokenizations leading to representational mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unmeasured fragility in LLMs resulting from multiple token ID sequences mapping to identical surface strings, causing reasoning flaws.

Method: Introduced a probe task requiring targeted word replacements in context to isolate tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts, analyzing over 11,000 trials.

Result: Detected a significant rate of phantom edits caused by tokenizer-induced representation flaws, classified into eight systematic artifact types.

Conclusion: Tokenizer inconsistencies hinder LLM reasoning, and improving tokenizer robustness is necessary before focusing on scaling up models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.

### [54] [AdaTIR: Adaptive Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14696)
*Zhaiyu Fang,Ruipeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaTIR, a framework that combines adaptive reasoning and efficient tool use to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents overly rely on external tool use, leading to inefficiencies and cognitive offloading, even for trivial tasks. This behavior undermines the goal of true agentic intelligence, which requires judicious tool use.

Method: AdaTIR employs a difficulty-aware efficiency reward system to dynamically manage tool use based on task complexity. It integrates Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS) to prioritize correctness while using tool efficiency as a secondary factor.

Result: AdaTIR reduces tool reliance by 97.6% in simple tasks and 28.2% in complex tasks without compromising accuracy. It also improves reasoning internalization, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on a specific dataset (AIME 2024) even without tool access.

Conclusion: The framework achieves a balance between task complexity and tool usage, internalizing reasoning for easier problems. This marks progress toward more autonomous and efficient LLM agents.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current agents tend to exhibit cognitive offloading, redundantly invoking external tools even for simple tasks. In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages. To resolve this, we propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS), which ensures that correctness remains the primary objective while using efficiency as a secondary constraint. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaTIR reduces tool calls by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex challenges while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Notably, AdaTIR successfully internalizes reasoning, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.

*Michael Theologitis,Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu,Chirag Shah,Dan Suciu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimDB introduces a novel fact-verification benchmark leveraging large-scale databases and reveals limitations in current AI models when reasoning over structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in fact-verification benchmarks by exploring claims grounded in large structured databases, which traditional evidence-reading approaches struggle with.

Method: Developed ClaimDB benchmark grounded in compositions of millions of records and multiple tables, evaluating 30 state-of-the-art LLMs' performance on this complex verification task.

Result: No evaluated model exceeded 83% accuracy, with many scoring below 55%. Both proprietary and open-source models showed inadequate abstention capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face difficulties in high-stakes structured data analysis, emphasizing the need for improved reasoning methods beyond evidence-reading.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in fact-verification benchmarks, claims grounded in large-scale structured data remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce ClaimDB, the first fact-verification benchmark where the evidence for claims is derived from compositions of millions of records and multiple tables. ClaimDB consists of 80 unique real-life databases covering a wide range of domains, from governance and healthcare to media, education and the natural sciences. At this scale, verification approaches that rely on "reading" the evidence break down, forcing a timely shift toward reasoning in executable programs. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source (below 70B) LLMs and find that none exceed 83% accuracy, with more than half below 55%. Our analysis also reveals that both closed- and open-source models struggle with abstention -- the ability to admit that there is no evidence to decide -- raising doubts about their reliability in high-stakes data analysis. We release the benchmark, code, and the LLM leaderboard at https://claimdb.github.io .

### [56] [DARL: Encouraging Diverse Answers for General Reasoning without Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14700)
*Chongxuan Huang,Lei Lin,Xiaodong Shi,Wenping Hu,Ruiming Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARL improves reinforcement learning by encouraging diverse and controlled answer generation without requiring extra verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance limitations of RLVR and RLPR in generating diverse outputs, especially in open-ended tasks.

Method: Develop DARL, a reinforcement learning framework that promotes diversity while aligning with reference answers, compatible with existing approaches.

Result: DARL achieves 1.3-point and 9.5-point gains on reasoning and general benchmarks, respectively, showing improved reasoning and diversity.

Conclusion: DARL effectively enhances reasoning and output diversity in reinforcement learning, surpassing existing methods like RLPR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated promising gains in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers. Extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning performance. Notably, DARL surpasses RLPR, achieving average gains of 1.3 points on six reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on seven general benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both reasoning accuracy and output diversity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Typhoon OCR is an open-source, vision-language model tailored for Thai and English document extraction, achieving high accuracy despite being compact and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with low-resource languages like Thai due to script complexity, lack of word boundaries, and unstructured documents. This study aims to address these limitations.

Method: The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-specific dataset created through a multi-stage process combining traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and synthetic data.

Result: Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or superior to larger proprietary models across diverse Thai document types, despite lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: An open vision-language OCR model, optimized for Thai, can achieve high accuracy rivaling proprietary systems while being lightweight and easier to deploy.

Abstract: Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.

*Yifan Wang,Shiyu Li,Peiming Li,Xiaochen Yang,Yang Tang,Zheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Render-of-Thought (RoT), a novel framework that condenses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by rendering reasoning steps into images, enabling faster inference and reduced token usage in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in language models but has high computational overhead and lacks explicit supervision on intermediate reasoning steps. This hampers the clarity and traceability of latent reasoning chains.

Method: RoT leverages vision encoders from Vision Language Models (VLMs) to align visual embeddings with textual data, simplifying reasoning chains into images. This design avoids additional pre-training and integrates seamlessly as a plug-and-play solution.

Result: RoT achieves 3-4x token compression and significantly accelerates inference while maintaining competitive performance in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RoT offers a more efficient and interpretable approach to reasoning by large language models, balancing computational efficiency with effective reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

*Anqi Li,Yuqian Chen,Yu Lu,Zhaoming Chen,Yuan Xie,Zhenzhong Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsyFIRE and RECAP frameworks for identifying client resistance behaviors in text-based mental health counseling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP approaches fail to adequately address fine-grained client resistance in counseling text, ignoring the complexity and interpretability needed for interventions.

Method: The authors developed PsyFIRE to classify 13 resistance behaviors in counseling texts and created the ClientResistance corpus with annotated utterances and rationale. Using this, they trained RECAP, a two-stage detection framework.

Result: RECAP achieved high performance in distinguishing resistance, outperforming baseline models by over 20 points and was applied to case studies demonstrating its impact on therapeutic strategies.

Conclusion: The tools build understanding of client resistance, improve intervention strategies, and enhance therapeutic relationship quality.

Abstract: Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.
  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.

*Yuxuan Cao,Zida Yang,Ye Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest performance on a customized Chinese film script continuation benchmark, showing GPT-5.2 excels in generating higher-quality, structurally cohesive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how LLMs perform on culturally specific creative writing tasks, especially in Chinese film script continuations.

Method: The study constructed a benchmark with 53 classic Chinese films, applied a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm, and evaluated results using ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and an LLM-as-Judge scoring method with DeepSeek-Reasoner.

Result: GPT-5.2 significantly outperformed Qwen-Max in structural preservation, overall quality, and composite scores, though Qwen-Max showed slightly better ROUGE-L scores.

Conclusion: GPT-5.2 demonstrates superior performance in terms of character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation for Chinese creative writing tasks, offering insights for reproducible evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative writing, their performance on culturally specific narrative tasks warrants systematic investigation. This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).
  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).
  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability. This study provides a reproducible framework for LLM evaluation in Chinese creative writing.

### [61] [HiNS: Hierarchical Negative Sampling for More Comprehensive Memory Retrieval Embedding Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14857)
*Motong Tian,Allen P. Wong,Mingjun Mao,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured training framework (HiNS) for embedding models in memory-augmented language agents to improve retrieval accuracy by addressing the limitations in current negative sample handling in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacies in current training methods which fail to reflect the natural and hierarchical complexity of negative samples in human-agent interactions, limiting embedding models' ability to retrieve memory effectively.

Method: The paper introduces the HiNS framework, which models difficulty tiers for negative samples and uses empirically derived negative ratios based on conversational data to enhance the training process of embedding models.

Result: The HiNS framework improves retrieval fidelity and generalization in memory-intensive tasks, as demonstrated by F1/BLEU-1 score improvements on datasets like LoCoMo and PERSONAMEM.

Conclusion: Using difficulty-tiered and empirically modeled negative samples in training significantly enhances embedding models' capabilities in memory retrieval, making them more adept for practical dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Memory-augmented language agents rely on embedding models for effective memory retrieval. However, existing training data construction overlooks a critical limitation: the hierarchical difficulty of negative samples and their natural distribution in human-agent interactions. In practice, some negatives are semantically close distractors while others are trivially irrelevant, and natural dialogue exhibits structured proportions of these types. Current approaches using synthetic or uniformly sampled negatives fail to reflect this diversity, limiting embedding models' ability to learn nuanced discrimination essential for robust memory retrieval. In this work, we propose a principled data construction framework HiNS that explicitly models negative sample difficulty tiers and incorporates empirically grounded negative ratios derived from conversational data, enabling the training of embedding models with substantially improved retrieval fidelity and generalization in memory-intensive tasks. Experiments show significant improvements: on LoCoMo, F1/BLEU-1 gains of 3.27%/3.30%(MemoryOS) and 1.95%/1.78% (Mem0); on PERSONAMEM, total score improvements of 1.19% (MemoryOS) and 2.55% (Mem0).

*Rui Qi,Fengran Mo,Yufeng Chen,Xue Zhang,Shuo Wang,Hongliang Li,Jinan Xu,Meng Jiang,Jian-Yun Nie,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LcRL introduces a reinforcement learning framework for multilingual retrieval-augmented generation, addressing issues of knowledge bias and conflict through language-coupled optimization and sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation struggles with integrating external knowledge effectively due to knowledge bias and conflict arising from unitive processing methods.

Method: LcRL employs language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization in reinforcement learning, alongside group sampling to reduce bias and an anti-consistency penalty to handle knowledge conflict.

Result: Experimental results show that LcRL delivers competitive performance and adapts to challenging scenarios like limited training data and multilingual retrieval.

Conclusion: LcRL offers a robust solution to improve multilingual retrieval-augmented generation and demonstrates its practicality in diverse use cases, enhancing knowledge integration and reducing biases.

Abstract: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) requires models to effectively acquire and integrate beneficial external knowledge from multilingual collections. However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages.

### [63] [PodBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Instruction-Aware Audio-Oriented Podcast Script Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14903)
*Chenning Xu,Mao Zheng,Mingyu Zheng,Mingyang Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PodBench, a benchmark to evaluate podcast script generation by synthesizing context-grounded dialogue with complex inputs. It reveals strengths and shortcomings of both proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Podcast script generation requires structured dialogue synthesis from complex inputs, but there is a lack of systematic resources to evaluate such tasks. This study aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors developed PodBench, featuring 800 diverse samples with long textual inputs and intricate, multi-speaker instructions. They also introduced a new evaluation framework combining quantitative and LLM-based analysis.

Result: Proprietary models usually excel, but open-source models with explicit reasoning perform better in handling long contexts and multi-speaker dialogues. A gap between instruction-following and substantive content was identified.

Conclusion: PodBench provides a reproducible platform to address challenges in generating long-form, audio-centric content and highlights areas for improvement in current models.

Abstract: Podcast script generation requires LLMs to synthesize structured, context-grounded dialogue from diverse inputs, yet systematic evaluation resources for this task remain limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce PodBench, a benchmark comprising 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and complex multi-speaker instructions. We propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that while proprietary models generally excel, open-source models equipped with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination compared to standard baselines. However, our analysis uncovers a persistent divergence where high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance. PodBench offers a reproducible testbed to address these challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation.

### [64] [CodeDelegator: Mitigating Context Pollution via Role Separation in Code-as-Action Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14914)
*Tianxiang Fei,Cheng Chen,Yue Pan,Mao Zheng,Mingyang Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeDelegator improves performance by separating planning and execution roles in multi-agent frameworks, tackling issues with long-horizon tasks in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to context pollution when simultaneously handling planning and implementation.

Method: The proposed CodeDelegator introduces a framework separating strategic Delegator (planning and monitoring) and Coder agents (task implementation). The Delegator focuses on planning while Coders handle executions in isolated states.

Result: CodeDelegator demonstrates improved performance and modular task-solving capabilities on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Role specialization and state separation in CodeDelegator enhance the agent’s ability to handle complex, long-term tasks effectively compared to monolithic designs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) allow agents to represent actions as executable code, offering greater expressivity than traditional tool-calling. However, real-world tasks often demand both strategic planning and detailed implementation. Using a single agent for both leads to context pollution from debugging traces and intermediate failures, impairing long-horizon performance. We propose CodeDelegator, a multi-agent framework that separates planning from implementation via role specialization. A persistent Delegator maintains strategic oversight by decomposing tasks, writing specifications, and monitoring progress without executing code. For each sub-task, a new Coder agent is instantiated with a clean context containing only its specification, shielding it from prior failures. To coordinate between agents, we introduce Ephemeral-Persistent State Separation (EPSS), which isolates each Coder's execution state while preserving global coherence, preventing debugging traces from polluting the Delegator's context. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeDelegator across diverse scenarios.

*Pierre-Antoine Lequeu,Léo Labat,Laurène Cave,Gaël Lejeune,François Yvon,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using LLMs for preprocessing citizen contributions in democratic consultations. It introduces a new framework and datasets for transforming noisy contributions into structured units, demonstrating the effectiveness of small LLMs for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address ethical challenges and improve analytical efficiency in using LLMs for democratic consultation data, focusing on standardizing citizen contributions pragmatically.

Method: The authors develop a preprocessing framework, Corpus Clarification, create a manually curated dataset (GDN-CC), and evaluate the performance of small LLMs and fine-tuned models for annotation and clustering tasks.

Result: Small Language Models match or outperform larger LLMs in annotation tasks and demonstrate usability in opinion clustering. They also release the GDN-CC-large dataset with 240k annotated contributions.

Conclusion: Small, transparent LLMs are a reliable and efficient solution for preprocessing and analyzing large-scale democratic consultation data, ensuring ethical and practical usability.

Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand Débat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.

*Zhiyuan Lu,Chenliang Li,Yingcheng Shi,Weizhou Shen,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CorpusQA, a benchmark for reasoning across large document repositories of up to 10 million tokens, addressing the weaknesses of current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to perform holistic reasoning across massive, unstructured corpora beyond individual long texts or sparse retrieval assumptions.

Method: The authors created CorpusQA using a novel data synthesis framework that generates computation-intensive queries with guaranteed answers, bypassing human annotation for reliable evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art long-context language models struggle with extended inputs, and retrieval-augmented systems fail entirely, but memory-augmented architectures perform better.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift is needed toward developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis rather than merely extending context window lengths in LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models now handle million-token contexts, their capacity for reasoning across entire document repositories remains largely untested. Existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they are mostly limited to single long texts or rely on a "sparse retrieval" assumption-that answers can be derived from a few relevant chunks. This assumption fails for true corpus-level analysis, where evidence is highly dispersed across hundreds of documents and answers require global integration, comparison, and statistical aggregation. To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely. Our findings indicate that memory-augmented agentic architectures offer a more robust alternative, suggesting a critical shift is needed from simply extending context windows to developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis.

*Minuri Rajapakse,Ruvan Weerasinghe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks modern language models (LMs) on Sinhala language, including Romanized text, revealing strong performances of specific models for Unicode and Romanized scripts while emphasizing disparities among closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the under-researched performance of language models in handling morphologically rich, lower-resource languages like Sinhala, particularly Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication.

Method: They evaluate open-source models using perplexity metrics and analyze closed-source models qualitatively on sentence completion performance. The study covers diverse scripts of Sinhala, including Unicode and Romanized formats.

Result: The Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model excels in Unicode text prediction, the Mistral-7B-v0.3 performs best on Romanized text, and Llama-3.1-8B shows strong performance across both scripts. Closed-source Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel in Unicode generation, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet leads in Romanized text handling.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical role of training data for script variations in language models and provides insights for practitioners working with Sinhala-specific applications, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate models for Unicode and Romanized text.

Abstract: The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.

### [68] [Obscuring Data Contamination Through Translation: Evidence from Arabic Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14994)
*Chaymaa Abbas,Nour Shamaa,Mariette Awad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses data contamination in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on multilingual benchmarks, particularly Arabic, and proposes Translation-Aware Contamination Detection to identify contamination effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination in LLM evaluation undermines proper assessment as models may rely on memorized benchmarks instead of generalizing. Existing contamination detection methods lack focus on multilingual datasets, creating a need for approaches addressing non-English languages.

Method: Several open-weight LLMs were fine-tuned using variable proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluated on English benchmarks. A method was extended to detect memorization of benchmarks by incorporating strategic modifications like Min-K% probability analysis for contamination signals.

Result: Translation into Arabic suppresses traditional contamination signs, but models still gain from contaminated data, especially those adept in Arabic. Rising Min-K% scores highlight contamination impact, leading to increased answer consistency across languages.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of multilingual and translation-aware contamination evaluation systems for LLMs to ensure transparency, fairness, and reproducibility in assessments.

Abstract: Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.
  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.

### [69] [Knowledge Restoration-driven Prompt Optimization: Unlocking LLM Potential for Open-Domain Relational Triplet Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15037)
*Xiaonan Jing,Gongqing Wu,Xingrui Zhuo,Lang Sun,Jiapu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the KRPO framework to enhance LLMs for Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) tasks, overcoming issues with traditional static prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ORTE rely on static and heuristic-driven prompts, which result in vulnerabilities to semantic ambiguity and permanent erroneous extraction patterns.

Method: The KRPO framework uses self-evaluation via knowledge restoration for feedback, a textual gradient-based prompt optimizer to refine prompts iteratively, and relation canonicalization memory to reduce redundancy and improve schema distinctness.

Result: KRPO achieves significant improvement in F1 scores for extraction tasks, outperforming strong baselines across three datasets.

Conclusion: KRPO optimizes prompts and reduces redundancies effectively, enhancing the ability of LLMs to perform complex ORTE tasks.

Abstract: Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.

*Zhichao Yan,Yunxiao Zhao,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Shaoru Guo,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogicScore evaluates logical coherence in Attributed Question Answering, highlighting the reasoning gaps in large LLMs. It introduces a global reasoning framework across Completeness, Conciseness, and Determinateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AQA evaluation focuses on verifying isolated statements and their attributions, ignoring logical coherence in long-form answers. This leads to LLMs generating factually correct but logically flawed responses.

Method: The paper proposes LogicScore, an evaluation framework based on Horn Rules, which uses a backward verification mechanism. It assesses reasoning on Completeness, Conciseness, and Determinateness across three QA datasets and 20+ LLMs.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs excel in attribution precision but perform poorly in logical reasoning. For example, Gemini-3 Pro shows 92.85% attribution precision but only 35.11% Conciseness.

Conclusion: LogicScore presents a more comprehensive evaluation approach, establishing a new standard for logical integrity in AI and promotes balancing reasoning coherence with factual accuracy in LLMs.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

TL;DR: This paper explains why multi-agent systems composed of large language models achieve better problem-solving performance using operator theory and constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model-based multi-agent systems show better performance with identical data, prompting the need for a formal explanation of this phenomenon.

Method: The paper uses operator theory and constrained optimization to model agents enforcing distinct validity constraints and investigates the convergence of multi-agent dynamics.

Result: The study found multi-agent systems converge to invariant solution sets that single agents cannot dynamically access, even under identical conditions.

Conclusion: Multi-agent composition improves the solution state dynamics by leveraging intersecting constraint sets and extending to modern text-based dialog systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of large language models often exhibit improved problem-solving performance despite operating on identical information. In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.

TL;DR: The study developed a 200-case benchmark dataset of chest radiographs with annotated labels, verified by experts, and proposed an AI-assisted labeling workflow to enhance labeling efficiency for radiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts to develop clinically useful multimodal large language model (LLM) tools in radiology.

Method: A total of 13,735 de-identified chest radiographs were processed with GPT-4o to extract abnormal findings from reports, mapped to 12 benchmark labels using a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning), and reviewed by 17 radiologists for accuracy. An AI-assisted labeling workflow and a robust sampling strategy ensured clinical relevance and range of difficulty.

Result: 200 chest radiographs were selected and divided into released and holdout datasets, with each image reviewed by three radiologists. The holdout dataset is designated for independent evaluation by RSNA. The benchmark is publicly available.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable publicly available radiology benchmark and introduces an AI-assisted labeling procedure that supports scalable and collaborative annotation for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.

### [73] [Automated Rubrics for Reliable Evaluation of Medical Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15161)
*Yinzhu Chen,Abdine Maiga,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating fine-grained, instance-specific evaluation rubrics for medical large language models, significantly improving their evaluation and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models in clinical decision-making introduces risks like hallucinations and unsafe suggestions, which are hard to detect with existing evaluation metrics or resource-intensive expert-authored rubrics.

Method: The authors propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that grounds evaluation on authoritative medical evidence, decomposes retrieved content into atomic facts, and synthesizes fine-grained rubrics tailored to specific interactions.

Result: The framework achieved a 60.12% Clinical Intent Alignment score (a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline) and demonstrated strong performance in discriminative tests (AUROC of 0.977), while improving response quality by 9.2%.

Conclusion: This scalable framework not only enhances evaluation in medical LLMs but also guides refinements to improve their outputs, offering a reliable foundation for safe and effective use in clinical environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($μ_Δ = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Automated-Rubric-Generation-AF3C/.

### [74] [The Flexibility Trap: Why Arbitrary Order Limits Reasoning Potential in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15165)
*Zanlin Ni,Shenzhi Wang,Yang Yue,Tianyu Yu,Weilin Zhao,Yeguo Hua,Tianyi Chen,Jun Song,Cheng Yu,Bo Zheng,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs), despite offering arbitrary order generation, may unintentionally hinder reasoning by bypassing critical high-uncertainty tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and address the reasoning capacity of dLLMs that theoretically promise better capabilities due to flexible token generation compared to autoregressive models.

Method: Examined the impact of dLLM arbitrary order generation and proposed a minimalist approach called JustGRPO, utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization to enhance reasoning without relying on flexible token order.

Result: The paper found that bypassing high-uncertainty tokens during arbitrary order generation diminishes reasoning efficiency and JustGRPO achieved strong performance (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K).

Conclusion: Effective reasoning is better achieved with structured token order than arbitrary flexibility, as proven by JustGRPO's superior results while maintaining parallel decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap

### [75] [Is Peer Review Really in Decline? Analyzing Review Quality across Venues and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15172)
*Ilia Kuznetsov,Rohan Nayak,Alla Rozovskaya,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the narrative of declining review quality in scientific peer review, particularly in AI and machine learning conferences, and finds no consistent evidence to support it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the concern of declining review quality in scientific peer review due to increasing submissions and evolving practices, as the claim lacks empirical evidence.

Method: Develop a framework for comparing review quality, applicable to AI and machine learning conferences, standardize review formats, and use a multi-dimensional schema with both machine-learning-based and lightweight metrics to measure review quality.

Result: The study finds no consistent decline in review quality across conferences or over time; it reveals diverse review formats and proposes methods for more reliable measurement.

Conclusion: The popular belief in declining review quality is not empirically supported. Alternative explanations and recommendations for future studies on review quality are provided.

Abstract: Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of nugget-based methods to assist legal professionals in evaluating and improving summary accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in factual accuracy of legal document summarization and explore how nugget-based methods can directly support end users.

Method: The authors present a prototype leveraging nugget-based approaches to assist in evaluating and improving summary accuracy in two specific scenarios: determining the better summary and manual enhancement.

Result: The nugget-based approach demonstrated promise in assisting users by improving the accuracy and quality of deposition summaries.

Conclusion: This paper highlights how nugget-based methods can effectively support end users in legal summarization tasks and suggests further exploration in this area.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.

### [77] [Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220)
*Anmol Goel,Cornelius Emde,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh,Martin Gubri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper unveils 'privacy collapse,' where fine-tuning language models can lead to severe privacy vulnerabilities despite maintaining good performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding privacy vulnerabilities during the fine-tuning of large language models, particularly as they are optimized for specific tasks.

Method: The work analyzes six different models, five datasets, and two types of task categories to assess the effect of fine-tuning on privacy. It also involves a mechanistic analysis to investigate why privacy representations deteriorate.

Result: Fine-tuning is shown to degrade contextual privacy norms, cause inappropriate data sharing, and lead to fragile privacy features, demonstrated across multiple models, datasets, and tasks.

Conclusion: Benign fine-tuning can silently lead to substantial privacy risks, underscoring an urgent need to rethink safety evaluations for specialized language models.

Abstract: We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.

### [78] [Metadata Conditioned Large Language Models for Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15236)
*Anjishnu Mukherjee,Ziwei Zhu,Antonios Anastasopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using metadata conditioning for localizing large language models for geographically distinct regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the issue of geographically homogenized behavior in language models by utilizing metadata to enhance regional performance and localization.

Method: The authors pre-trained 31 models (0.5B and 1B parameters) on English news data annotated with metadata like country and continent tags. They conducted controlled experiments with metadata conditioning to evaluate its impact on localization and generalization.

Result: Metadata conditioning improved in-region performance without harming cross-region generalization. It allowed global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models and enhanced learning efficiency. URL metadata was found to capture much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remained essential.

Conclusion: Metadata conditioning is proposed as a compute-efficient and effective approach for enhancing localization in language models.

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.

*Rian Dolphin,Joe Dursun,Jarrett Blankenship,Katie Adams,Quinton Pike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using AI for extracting risk factors from corporate documents, aligning them with a pre-defined taxonomy, and continuously improving the taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in extracting structured risk factors from unstructured corporate filings using AI, while maintaining alignment with a hierarchical taxonomy and improving system quality over time.

Method: The methodology involves a three-stage pipeline: LLM-based extraction with supporting quotes, semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and validation through LLM-as-a-judge filtering. Additionally, it incorporates autonomous taxonomy refinement based on evaluation feedback.

Result: The approach extracted 10,688 risk factors from S&P 500 companies and demonstrated higher similarity in risk profiles within the same industry. The improved taxonomy achieved a 104.7% increase in embedding separation, confirming meaningful industry-based structural insights.

Conclusion: The method is effective in structured risk factor extraction and taxonomy alignment, with the added capability of autonomous refinement, showcasing its potential applicability across various domains needing unstructured text processing.

Abstract: We present a methodology for extracting structured risk factors from corporate 10-K filings while maintaining adherence to a predefined hierarchical taxonomy. Our three-stage pipeline combines LLM extraction with supporting quotes, embedding-based semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and LLM-as-a-judge validation that filters spurious assignments. To evaluate our approach, we extract 10,688 risk factors from S&P 500 companies and examine risk profile similarity across industry clusters. Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen's d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p<0.001). The methodology generalizes to any domain requiring taxonomy-aligned extraction from unstructured text, with autonomous improvement enabling continuous quality maintenance and enhancement as systems process more documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs excel in arithmetic but struggle with non-standard numeral formats; few-shot prompting and numeral mapping strategies help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs handle numerical reasoning when inputs deviate from the common conventions or numeral formats in training data.

Method: Evaluate LLM performance on diverse numerical scripts and formats, and test the effect of adjustments like few-shot prompting and numeral mapping.

Result: LLM accuracy significantly decreases with unusual numeral formats, but targeted interventions close this gap.

Conclusion: While LLMs exhibit strong numerical reasoning under common conditions, they falter with atypical numeral formats. Effective prompting strategies can mitigate this issue and offer paths for improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive proficiency in basic arithmetic, rivaling human-level performance on standard numerical tasks. However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.

*Sahar Tahmasebi,Eric Müller-Budack,Ralph Ewerth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerability of fake news detectors to sentiment manipulation and introduces AdSent for sentiment-robust fake news detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in fake news research regarding the unexamined vulnerability of sentiment manipulation in automated detection systems, which adversaries exploit using large language models.

Method: The authors propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks, analyze sentiment impact on detection performance, and introduce sentiment-agnostic training in their framework AdSent.

Result: Experiments show that sentiment manipulation drastically affects detection accuracy, while AdSent demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of accounting for sentiment manipulation in fake news detection and showcases AdSent's efficiency in mitigating these adversarial challenges.

Abstract: Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.

*Ho Yin Au,Junkun Jiang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) for better control in text-to-motion generation by allowing symbolic specification of orientations and motion timings, alongside effective motion generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion frameworks lack precision in controlling body part orientations and timing. Current approaches based on joint keyframe locations offer limited and unintuitive guidance.

Method: The authors propose an SOS script framework for specifying orientations and timings. They also devised an automatic SOS extraction pipeline using clustering and masking techniques. Moreover, they introduce SOSControl, a motion generation framework improving alignment with constraints using data augmentation, iterative optimization, and a ControlNet-based decoder.

Result: The SOS framework yields interpretable scripts highlighting salient keyframes, and the SOSControl framework surpasses baselines in motion quality, control, and adaptability.

Conclusion: The SOS framework significantly enhances motion generation by introducing symbolic annotations for precision and outperforming existing baselines in key control metrics.

Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for efficient and scalable multimodal emotion recognition in human-computer interaction, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single-modality emotion recognition systems, such as poor generalization and robustness in real-world environments, and to enable real-time understanding of users' emotions in next-generation HCI.

Method: Proposed a Cross-Modal Transformer framework that integrates visual, auditory, and textual modalities using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT), employing a cloud-based distributed training system on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving to ensure scalability and low latency.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, improving F1-score by 3.0%, reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9%, and achieving a 35% latency reduction compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, cloud-native solution for real-time multimodal emotion recognition, enabling applications in adaptive human-computer interaction and emotionally intelligent systems.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for enhanced power grid design review, overcoming limitations such as high computational demands and lack of semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reviewing ultra-high-resolution power grid engineering design drawings, ensuring system safety by overcoming limitations in automated systems regarding computational efficiency and semantic understanding.

Method: A novel three-stage framework: 1) MLLM for global semantic understanding identifies domain-specific regions, 2) High-resolution fine-grained recognition within these regions, and 3) Decision-making module for accurate diagnosis using confidence-aware results.

Result: The approach significantly improves macroscopic semantic understanding, design error identification accuracy, and reliability in review results compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates a novel prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid design review, enhancing MLLM capabilities and offering improved defect discovery and judgment reliability.

Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

### [85] [Transfer Learning from One Cancer to Another via Deep Learning Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14678)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines domain adaptation in cancer histopathology classification, showing that a domain adversarial network (DANN) can significantly improve cross-domain generalization compared to standard models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models excel in-domain but fail to generalize across unseen cancer types, necessitating solutions for domain shift to enable robust performance in cancer histopathology.

Method: The study evaluates a standard ResNet50 and a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) for classifying lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas, with an emphasis on domain adaptation. Stain normalization's role is also analyzed.

Result: ResNet50 achieves over 98% accuracy within its own domain but fails across different domains. DANN improves target domain accuracy, reaching 95.56% on lung data. Stain normalization has variable effects depending on the target domain.

Conclusion: DANNs facilitate cross-domain generalization in cancer histopathology by leveraging biologically meaningful features, showing promise as a robust tool for handling domain shifts.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Junxu Liu,Haibo Hu,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of concept erasure in diffusion models and proposes LURE, a method to reawaken erased concepts by reconstructing latent spaces and guiding sampling trajectories effectively, even in multi-concept scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome vulnerabilities in existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models by enabling a better understanding and reawakening of erased concepts.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze factors impacting concept erasure and propose LURE, which includes a semantic re-binding mechanism, Gradient Field Orthogonalization, and Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) to reconstruct latent spaces and ensure stability in reawakening.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LURE can efficiently and simultaneously reawaken multiple erased concepts with high fidelity across various tasks and erasure methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LURE method enhances the understanding and application of concept reawakening in diffusion models, offering a robust solution to counter concept erasure vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks focusing on urban environments for cross-view spatial reasoning in embodied AI, which is crucial for spatial understanding, planning, and simulation.

Method: The authors developed CityCube, a systematic benchmark with 5,022 annotated multi-view QA pairs. It incorporates varied viewpoint dynamics from vehicles, drones, and satellites, categorized into cognitive dimensions and spatial relations.

Result: Evaluation of 33 VLMs using CityCube showed large models performing significantly below humans (54.1% accuracy vs. human accuracy). However, fine-tuned smaller-scale models exceeded 60% accuracy.

Conclusion: CityCube exposes performance gaps between VLMs and humans in reasoning tasks, pointing to the necessity of this benchmark to advance AI capabilities in open urban environments.

Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SegAE, a model for assessing label quality in medical segmentation datasets with high accuracy and efficiency, enhancing training robustness and reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation datasets often contain uneven quality labels, which negatively impact model robustness and training outcomes.

Method: The paper proposes SegAE, a vision-language model trained on over four million image-label pairs, with the ability to predict label quality across 142 anatomical structures efficiently.

Result: SegAE demonstrates strong correlation with ground-truth metrics, identifies data quality issues in public datasets, enhances active and semi-supervised learning performance, and substantially reduces annotation costs and quality-checking time.

Conclusion: SegAE is a lightweight and effective tool for quality control in medical segmentation datasets, improving data efficiency and reducing costs while maintaining high evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need precise traffic scene understanding to ensure safe navigation, motivating the creation of a model for spatial and semantic interpretation.

Method: A hybrid attention mechanism extracts spatial and semantic features, leveraging them to provide detailed natural language descriptions of traffic scenes. A new dataset was created from BDD100K to train and test the model.

Result: The model showed strong performance using metrics like CIDEr and SPICE, as well as human judgment assessments on the newly developed dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively interprets and describes traffic scenes, addressing a significant gap in autonomous vehicle perception.

Abstract: Traffic scene understanding is essential for enabling autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive and interpret their environment, thereby ensuring safe navigation. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.

*A. Enes Doruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current 3D voxelization methods for autonomous vehicles by presenting a Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR 3D occupancy prediction model. It focuses on improving efficiency and robustness by leveraging the strengths of both camera and LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of long-tail safety issues and inefficiencies in current 3D voxelization methods, particularly their computational complexity and brittleness in dynamic environments.

Method: The study proposes a 3D Gaussian-based adaptive model with four critical components: (1) Depth-wise deformable sampling for LiDAR data, (2) Entropy-based feature smoothing for noise handling, (3) Dynamic camera-LiDAR fusion, and (4) A selective state-space model for global context decoding.

Result: The model efficiently fuses semantic strengths of the camera with geometric strengths of the LiDAR, achieving memory efficiency and adaptability. It provides linear computational complexity through its Gauss-Mamba head design.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly improves 3D occupancy prediction by addressing computational challenges, sensor fusion, and dynamic adaptability, making it a promising approach for autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

*Yajvan Ravan,Aref Malek,Chester Dolph,Nikhil Behari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a high-altitude multi-spectral aerial wildfire imagery dataset, employing deep learning models to improve fire perimeter detection, reaching 96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve algorithms and machine learning models for detecting and managing wildfires, leveraging scarce but valuable high-altitude, multi-spectral imagery data.

Method: The paper presents a novel dataset derived from NASA's AMS sensor, capturing 12-channel multi-spectral data, and utilizes two deep neural networks for image classification and pixel-level segmentation integrated into a real-time wildfire detection model.

Result: The model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% IoU, and 84% recall, surpassing previous models while being capable of detecting wildfire at night and behind obscurities like smoke and clouds.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that combining multi-spectral channels such as SWIR, IR, and thermal can significantly boost wildfire detection capabilities, presenting a superior method to classical algorithms and satellite-based models, while offering publicly available data and code.

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters. Our code and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/Autonomous-Modular-Sensor-Wildfire-Segmentation/tree/main and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u4vs9rqwkwgdeeeoUhftCxrfe_4QPTn?=usp=drive_link

*Frank Bieder,Hendrik Königshof,Haohao Hu,Fabian Immel,Yinzhe Shen,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents XD-MAP, a novel method for transferring knowledge from image datasets to LiDAR for semantic tasks, outperforming baseline approaches without requiring manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the challenge of adapting training datasets to deployment domains, especially across sensor modalities, to enhance deep learning model performance.

Method: The method uses a neural network to generate a semantic parametric map from camera images, which is then used to produce pseudo labels for LiDAR data without overlapping sensors and expanding beyond camera views.

Result: XD-MAP significantly improved metrics for 2D semantic segmentation (+19.5 mIoU), 2D panoptic segmentation (+19.5 PQth), and 3D semantic segmentation (+32.3 mIoU).

Conclusion: XD-MAP demonstrates that sensor-specific knowledge can be effectively transferred to LiDAR, achieving strong performance without requiring manual annotations.

Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

*Yingsong Huang,Hui Guo,Jing Huang,Bing Bai,Qi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the DEUA framework to improve the detection of diffusion-generated images by focusing on epistemic uncertainty and incorporating asymmetric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust methods to detect diffusion-generated images due to their increasing prevalence.

Method: The paper proposes DEUA, which uses Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty estimated via the Laplace approximation and incorporates an asymmetric loss function for balanced classifier training.

Result: Extensive experiments validate DEUA's state-of-the-art performance in detecting diffusion-generated images across large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focusing on epistemic uncertainty and asymmetric learning can significantly enhance the generalizability and performance of detectors for generated images.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: GutenOCR models fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL for grounded OCR tasks, achieving significant performance improvements in reading, detection, and grounding on business and scientific documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve OCR capabilities, such as grounded reading and detection, by fine-tuning foundational vision-language models for practical use in business documents and scientific literature.

Method: The authors developed GutenOCR by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL models (3B and 7B sizes) using training data including business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data. They designed a unified, prompt-based interface to enable full-page and localized reading with bounding boxes.

Result: GutenOCR-7B achieved major improvements, doubling the grounded OCR composite score (from 0.40 to 0.82) on held-out business and scientific pages. It also showed advancements on Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5 for region- and line-level OCR performance, albeit with trade-offs in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: GutenOCR demonstrates significant advancements in grounded OCR performance, particularly in fine-grained tasks, though some trade-offs are observed, which could guide future research directions in page-level and specialized layouts.

Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [95] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for MRI reconstruction called PAS-Mamba, which separates phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and integrates with image-domain features for accurate reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the existing issue of unified frequency-domain modeling in MRI reconstruction, which neglects the distinct information carried by phase and magnitude and their coupling interference.

Method: The proposed PAS-Mamba framework decouples amplitude and phase using two separate branches, employs Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to process frequency data geometrically, and incorporates a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) for feature fusion between domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like IXI and fastMRI knee demonstrate that PAS-Mamba outperforms current state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods with enhanced accuracy and finer details.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that decoupling phase and magnitude in the frequency domain combined with spatial image-domain features enhances MRI reconstruction accuracy and outperforms traditional methods.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDT-Net is proposed for medical image segmentation with scribble annotations, improving supervision quality using a dual-teacher, single-student framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often requires precise annotations, which are labor-intensive. Scribble-based annotations reduce this burden but bring annotation sparsity and ambiguity.

Method: The authors introduced SDT-Net with a Dynamic Teacher Switching module to adaptively select a teacher. It propagates high-confidence pseudo-labels using PRP and enforces alignment via a Hierarchical Consistency module.

Result: SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets with accurate and anatomically consistent segmentation.

Conclusion: The results highlight the effectiveness of SDT-Net in improving segmentation accuracy and anatomical plausibility with weaker supervision signals.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for enhancing video inference (VI) by optimizing both resource efficiency and inference performance using a fuzzy controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance in current video inference methods.

Method: Developing a fuzzy controller (FC-r) to dynamically guide the framework in leveraging spatiotemporal correlations and switching between models of varying scales based on real-time resources.

Result: The proposed method showcased an effective balance between resource utilization and inference performance during experiments.

Conclusion: The framework achieves resource-efficient and effective video inference by utilizing a fuzzy controller and adapting to real-time conditions dynamically.

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AG-LDM, a novel framework for modeling brain MRI progression. It simplifies training and ensures anatomical consistency, outperforming prior models in image quality and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and anatomical consistency of brain MRI progression modeling, addressing the limitations of complex architectures and suboptimal conditional covariate use in existing models.

Method: AG-LDM involves segmentation-guided latent diffusion, fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input. A lightweight segmentation model ensures consistent training of an end-to-end framework.

Result: AG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art image quality, reduces volumetric errors by 15-20%, and demonstrates high sensitivity in utilizing clinical covariates. It accurately captures Alzheimer's progression patterns such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion.

Conclusion: AG-LDM provides an efficient and reliable solution for brain MRI progression modeling with strong biological plausibility and reduced architectural complexity.

Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

Motivation: Deep learning in medical imaging is hindered by the dependence on expert annotations and the computing challenges of 3D self-supervised models like VoCo.

Method: They proposed 2D-VoCo, a 2D slice-level contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach for CT scans, which is then utilized in a CNN-LSTM framework to classify multi-organ injuries.

Result: The approach was tested on the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, showing substantial improvements in mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA scores compared to models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: 2D-VoCo is an effective method to enhance medical CT analysis performance while mitigating the challenges of labeled data scarcity and computational issues. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch. Our framework provides a practical method to reduce the dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis. We release the code for reproducibility. https://github.com/tkz05/2D-VoCo-CT-Classifier

*Lianying Chao,Linfeng Yin,Peiyu Ren,Yifan Jiang,Qiaoyu Ren,Dingcheng Shan,Jing-cheng Pang,Sijie Wu,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) for improving video captioning by selecting diverse and event-relevant frames using feedback from video-LLMs, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling of video frames for captioning fails to address unequal event distribution, limiting captioning accuracy.

Method: A Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) strategically selects diverse and relevant frames with temporal importance modeling and caption feedback optimization. Additionally, a new benchmark, ICH-CC, is introduced for human-aligned video understanding.

Result: LFS improves video captioning performance across existing benchmarks and the new ICH-CC, showing up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC.

Conclusion: LFS effectively enhances video captioning and video question answering by optimizing frame selection, providing an easy-to-use solution.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of a spatial scratchpad, a 3D reasoning substrate for visual language models (VLMs), enabling better spatial reasoning and image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the spatial reasoning ability of VLMs, addressing limitations in generating geometrically accurate and compositional images.

Method: The framework parses text prompts, transforms linguistic elements into editable 3D meshes, and plans spatial arrangements using agentic scene planning, rendering spatially consistent visuals.

Result: Achieved a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, showcasing effective spatial reasoning capabilities for controllable image generation.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the importance and effectiveness of explicit 3D reasoning in advancing vision-language models' ability to generate coherent and spatially deliberate images.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in medical segmentation with limited and diverse datasets, such as differences in modalities, protocols, and anatomy.

Method: U-Harmony normalizes and denormalizes feature distributions with a domain-gated head, enabling a single model to learn from diverse datasets.

Result: Experiments demonstrated U-Harmony's effectiveness in achieving robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation across institutions.

Conclusion: U-Harmony helps in creating a universally adaptable and robust segmentation model, overcoming data heterogeneity in clinical practice.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-Taxon is introduced to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for taxonomic classification by improving hierarchical consistency and leaf-level accuracy, significantly outperforming larger models with smaller data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with hierarchical reasoning, leading to errors in taxonomic classification. Current solutions largely overlook this aspect.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework (VL-Taxon): (1) a top-down process to improve leaf-level accuracy, and (2) a stage ensuring hierarchical consistency. Supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning is used for training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VL-Taxon improves performance on both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy by over 10%, implemented on a smaller model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) using limited data on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

Conclusion: VL-Taxon successfully addresses hierarchical understanding issues in VLMs, enhancing their reasoning potential and achieving notable performance improvements while being resource-efficient.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

Result: Forest-Chat performs well on the Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees, showcasing its ability for change detection and captioning in bi-temporal satellite imagery.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the practicality of interactive and integrated AI-driven systems in improving forest monitoring, analysis, and usability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

### [105] [READ-Net: Clarifying Emotional Ambiguity via Adaptive Feature Recalibration for Audio-Visual Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14651)
*Chenglizhao Chen,Boze Li,Mengke Song,Dehao Feng,Xinyu Liu,Shanchen Pang,Jufeng Yang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces READ-Net, an audio-visual framework that improves depression detection by addressing emotional ambiguity through adaptive feature recalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional depression detection methods often fail to capture subtle emotional cues or confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms.

Method: The proposed READ-Net framework employs Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) to dynamically weight emotional signals, isolating depression-related cues while filtering irrelevant emotional noise.

Result: READ-Net shows significant improvement in depression detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with gains of 4.55% in accuracy and 1.26% in F1-score.

Conclusion: READ-Net effectively resolves emotional ambiguity and enhances audio-visual depression detection, demonstrating robustness against emotional interference and potential for integration into existing systems.

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

### [106] [Mirai: Autoregressive Visual Generation Needs Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14671)
*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of foresight signals in autoregressive (AR) visual generators to improve coherence and speed up training. The proposed Mirai framework incorporates future information into AR training without adding complexity, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of AR visual generators that rely on strict causality supervision, which leads to poor global coherence and slow convergence. It aims to investigate whether introducing foresight (future tokens) into the training can alleviate these issues.

Method: The authors develop Mirai, a framework introducing foresight into AR training. Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from unidirectional representations, while Mirai-I employs implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Both methods avoid architectural changes and inference overhead.

Result: Experiments show that Mirai notably accelerates AR model training and enhances output quality. For instance, it speeds up LlamaGen-B convergence by up to 10x and improves FID scores from 5.34 to 4.34 on ImageNet's benchmark.

Conclusion: Foresight integration is crucial for improving AR visual generators, enhancing their efficiency in training and global coherence in output. The Mirai framework demonstrates this, contributing significantly to both convergence speed and generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to video re-rendering using implicit geometric knowledge from a latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model, enabling state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in video re-rendering caused by limitations in geometrically unconditioned models (spatial inaccuracies) and geometrically-conditioned models (susceptibility to depth errors).

Method: Utilize the implicit geometric knowledge in latent space from a 4D reconstruction model, combined with source camera poses, to guide video generation.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video re-rendering tasks by effectively regularizing errors without explicit reconstruction.

Conclusion: By leveraging a diffusion prior and latent scene structure, the method provides a flexible and accurate solution to video re-rendering, overcoming previous challenges associated with spatial awareness and depth inaccuracies.

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

TL;DR: This paper proposes FeedbackSTS-Det, a novel scheme for infrared small target detection using a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in infrared small target detection caused by low signal-to-clutter ratios, dynamic interference, and indistinct target features, aiming to achieve more robust and efficient detection under complex backgrounds.

Method: The authors introduced a spatio-temporal semantic feedback mechanism with forward and backward refinement modules and a structured sparse semantic module (SSM) for efficient temporal modeling and improved inter-frame registration.

Result: The FeedbackSTS-Det model outperformed existing methods in experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: FeedbackSTS-Det offers an efficient and reliable solution to infrared small target detection challenges, featuring robustness, long-range dependency modeling, and effective false alarm suppression.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.

### [110] [RegFreeNet: A Registration-Free Network for CBCT-based 3D Dental Implant Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14703)
*Xinquan Yang,Xuguang Li,Mianjie Zheng,Xuefen Liu,Kun Tang,Kian Ming Lim,He Meng,Jianfeng Ren,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of implant position labeling in dentistry by introducing a method that avoids the time-consuming process of registration between pre- and post-implantation CBCT scans. By masking implants in post-implantation data, it enables broader dataset construction and proposes a comprehensive dataset, ImplantFairy, as well as an advanced prediction network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for labeling implant position require paired CBCT data and accurate registration between pre- and post-implantation datasets, which is time-intensive and unavailable in many settings. The authors aim to simplify this process to enable the construction of large multi-center datasets.

Method: The authors mask implants in post-implantation data, making any CBCT scan usable for training, thus eliminating the need for a registration process. They also created ImplantFairy, a voxel-level 3D annotated dataset of 1622 CBCTs, and developed a slope-aware implant position prediction network with modules for tooth area feature extraction and robust implant slope prediction.

Result: This new method enables large-scale, multi-center datasets. The proposed RegFreeNet prediction network achieves state-of-the-art performance in implant position predictions as verified on the ImplantFairy dataset and two public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach allows simplified and efficient implant position training by removing the dependency on registration and enabling broader dataset applicability. This innovation advances dental implant prediction with practical tools like ImplantFairy and RegFreeNet.

Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of fashion image retrieval in live e-commerce contexts, embedding real-world scenarios including contemporary challenges and trends.

Method: LookBench uses time-stamped, real product images and AI-generated fashion images, grounded in fine-grained taxonomy, focusing on single-item and outfit-level retrieval and periodic updates.

Result: LookBench benchmark results show strong baselines struggled to achieve $60\%$ Recall@1. The best-performing model was proprietary, and the second-best open-source model achieved comparable results.

Conclusion: The benchmark is a challenging, updateable framework that provides a measure of progress for fashion image retrieval in e-commerce setups. It offers dataset, leaderboard, evaluation code, and models for public access.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

*Yiyang Fu,Hui Li,Wangyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called CPF-CTE for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), enhancing feature representations using contextual relations and class-specific semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in current WSSS methods, such as neglect of contextual dependencies and incomplete feature representations.

Method: The authors propose the CPF-CTE framework, featuring CF-BiLSTM for capturing spatial dependencies and learnable class tokens for improving semantic representation.

Result: CPF-CTE achieves better segmentation accuracy and outperforms existing WSSS methods on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating contextual and semantic cues with CPF-CTE improves segmentation robustness and accuracy, offering a promising direction for WSSS.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with streaming video understanding due to inefficiencies in maintaining stable performance, real-time responses, and managing GPU memory overhead.

Method: HERMES uses a hierarchical KV cache memory framework to encapsulate video information at multiple granularities, enabling efficient reuse of memory for streaming inputs without auxiliary computations.

Result: HERMES achieves 10x faster TTFT than prior state-of-the-art models, maintains or improves accuracy across benchmarks with up to 11.4% gains, even with reduced video tokens.

Conclusion: HERMES presents a significant step forward in solving challenges in streaming video understanding, offering efficient real-time responses and reduced resource consumption while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing molecular language models and vision-language models in accurately capturing stereochemical details and mapping continuous 3D molecular structures into actionable discrete tokens.

Method: A dual-view framework named DeepMoLM that integrates visual features from high-resolution molecular images and geometric details encoded as Extended 3D Fingerprints, using cross-attention for stream fusion.

Result: DeepMoLM achieves a 12.3% METEOR improvement in PubChem captioning, quantitative accuracy in molecular property queries, and competitive state-of-the-art results in molecular description generation.

Conclusion: DeepMoLM effectively bridges visual and geometric molecular data, enabling reliable stereochemical interpretation and language generation, demonstrating potential for broad applications in chemical research.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/1anj/DeepMoLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately inferring occluded 3D geometry from single RGB images, which is critical in real-world applications requiring 3D scene understanding.

Method: FlowSSC treats SSC as a conditional generation problem and integrates a Shortcut Flow-matching mechanism in a triplane latent space. This approach enables efficient, high-fidelity generation within a single step.

Result: FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FlowSSC combines generative reasoning with real-time capability for SSC, offering a practical and superior solution for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

*Liqin Wang,Qianyue Hu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoidFace is a defense method against privacy threats posed by face-swapping technologies, disrupting their identity pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle insufficient defenses against privacy issues caused by diffusion-based face-swapping systems.

Method: VoidFace disrupts face-swapping pathways via localization disruption, identity erasure, decoupling attention mechanisms, and injecting perturbations in diffusion features.

Result: VoidFace demonstrates superior performance against face-swapping systems while ensuring high-quality, imperceptible images.

Conclusion: VoidFace is an effective systemic defense against privacy threats from diffusion-based face-swapping models.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating high-quality robot-interaction videos and the absence of standardized benchmarks for fair evaluation and progress.

Method: The authors propose RBench, a benchmark with sub-metrics to evaluate task correctness and visual fidelity, and introduce RoVid-X, a dataset created using a refined four-stage pipeline.

Result: RBench effectively exposes deficiencies in existing models (correlating 96% with human evaluation), and RoVid-X provides 4 million annotated video clips to support training and evaluation.

Conclusion: The combined benchmark and dataset establish a rigorous platform for advancing video generation models, aiming to push embodied AI towards general intelligence.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-edge collaborative framework for generating high-resolution images through optimized super-resolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I generation systems struggle to achieve high-resolution outputs due to latency and image fidelity trade-offs.

Method: The system generates a low-resolution image on the edge, partitions it into patches, and applies region-aware hybrid SR techniques to selectively enhance foreground and background for efficiency and quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a 33% reduction in service latency while preserving competitive image quality compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances computational efficiency and image fidelity, advancing high-resolution T2I generation for improved user experience.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative refinement method for text-to-image models to enhance their performance on complex prompts requiring multiple object and relational comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with richly compositional prompts where multiple constraints (objects, relations, attributes) must be satisfied, and existing inference strategies are insufficient in these complex scenarios.

Method: They propose a test-time iterative refinement approach where the T2I model generates outputs over multiple steps, with guidance from a vision-language model acting as a feedback critic.

Result: This method achieves significant improvements on various benchmarks, including a 16.9% gain on ConceptMix (k=7), 13.8% on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial), and 12.5% on Visual Jenga, outperforming parallel sampling approaches.

Conclusion: The iterative self-correction strategy enhances compositional image generation by breaking down complex prompts into successive corrections, achieving better fidelity and higher human preference rates.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances computational pathology's interpretability, contributing significant advancements in reasoning and performance scalability.

Abstract: Interpretability is significant in computational pathology, leading to the development of multimodal information integration from histopathological image and corresponding text data.However, existing multimodal methods have limited interpretability due to the lack of high-quality dataset that support explicit reasoning and inference and simple reasoning process.To address the above problems, we introduce a novel multimodal pathology large language model with strong reasoning capabilities.To improve the generation of accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions, we design a semantic reward strategy integrated with group relative policy optimization.We construct a high-quality pathology visual question answering (VQA) dataset, specifically designed to support complex reasoning tasks.Comprehensive experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when trained with only 20% of the data.Our method also achieves comparable performance on downstream zero-shot image classification task compared with CLIP.

Result: The proposed methods enhance performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone pretrained with SimCLR.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness of MIL, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning in advancing the automated analysis of CCE images, with broader implications for other medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates medical vision-language models (VLMs) and their feature representations, highlighting their effectiveness and areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learned feature representations of medical vision-language models (VLMs) for improving their diagnostic relevance and performance in medical image analysis.

Method: Analyzed feature distributions generated by medical VLMs across multiple lesion classification datasets and compared them with non-medical VLMs' outputs.

Result: Medical VLMs extract discriminative features for classification, but models with contextual enrichment like LLM2CLIP provide refined representations. Non-medical models showed vulnerabilities to textual biases.

Conclusion: Enhancing text encoders is more beneficial than extensive medical image training when developing medical VLMs, and careful consideration is needed for model selection to address biases and task requirements.

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-modal perception network, M2I2HA, leveraging hypergraph theory to improve object detection accuracy in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in extracting task-relevant information within and across modalities and achieve precise cross-modal alignment for better object detection in multi-modal environments.

Method: The architecture incorporates Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement, Inter-Hypergraph Fusion modules, and M2-FullPAD for adaptive multi-level feature fusion, leveraging hypergraph theory to model many-to-many relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

Conclusion: M2I2HA effectively addresses multi-modal perception challenges and improves detection accuracy, making it valuable for applications requiring robust multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FunCineForge, a pipeline and model for movie dubbing, addressing challenges in dataset limitations and dubbing model performance. It offers significant improvements across various cinematic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dubbing methods suffer from limited datasets and focus only on lip regions, leading to suboptimal quality in cinematic context and emotion portrayal.

Method: The authors propose FunCineForge, a dubbing pipeline for creating large-scale annotated datasets and an MLLM-based model tailored for diverse cinematic scenes.

Result: They created a Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations and demonstrated superior performance of their model in lip sync, audio quality, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Conclusion: The FunCineForge model and pipeline significantly improve dubbing quality over existing methods and open possibilities for diverse cinematic applications.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to improve text-to-motion generation through a motion-specific latent space and a Reconstructive Error Guidance mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current motion diffusion models due to representational gaps in pre-trained text encoders and error propagation during iterative denoising.

Method: RAM introduces co-training with motion reconstruction branches for accurate latent mapping and proposes testing-stage Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) to exploit self-correction ability, reducing error propagation.

Result: RAM demonstrates significant enhancements and achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-guided motion generation.

Conclusion: RAM effectively addresses representational and error propagation issues in motion diffusion models, offering improvements in accuracy and performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

*Ziyao Ling,Silvia Mirri,Paola Salomoni,Giovanni Delnevo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using synthetic images generated with Stable Diffusion and LoRA to improve deep learning classification of rare Chinese porcelain artifacts, showing task-dependent improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of training data in archaeological artifact classification, particularly for rare Chinese porcelain types, and to explore if synthetic images can augment the dataset effectively.

Method: The study generated synthetic images using Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and tested their impact on CNN-based classification tasks by training models with mixed real-synthetic datasets at different ratios.

Result: Using mixed datasets improved performance in type, dynasty, and kiln classification tasks, with type classification showing the highest improvement (5.5% F1-macro with 90:10 real-to-synthetic ratio), but results varied based on task and synthetic data alignment.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can enhance model performance for specific archaeological artifact classification tasks, but its effectiveness depends on the alignment of generated features with task requirements, providing insights for generative AI use in archaeology.

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

### [128] [UniRoute: Unified Routing Mixture-of-Experts for Modality-Adaptive Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14797)
*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Wei Lu,Zhihui You,Chengzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive remote sensing change detection. It effectively addresses challenges posed by different modality settings and geometrically misaligned scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods struggle with scalability across modalities and fail to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous Earth observation tasks effectively.

Method: UniRoute uses conditional routing of features through Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) and Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) modules. Additionally, a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy is deployed to stabilize training in heterogeneous settings.

Result: UniRoute shows strong overall performance across five public datasets, achieving precise boundary delineation and effective noise suppression under unified deployment.

Conclusion: UniRoute provides a scalable and accurate solution for modality-adaptive change detection, addressing challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous Earth observation scenarios.

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents UBATrack, a framework for multi-modal object tracking using a mamba-style state space model, achieving superior performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal trackers overlook effective spatio-temporal cue integration, limiting tracking performance.

Method: UBATrack uses Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer to model cross-modal dependencies and improve feature representation efficiently.

Result: UBATrack demonstrates superior tracking performance on six widely-used RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UBATrack introduces efficient modules for multi-modal tracking, offering remarkable accuracy without full-parameter fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocBAM, an attention mechanism to improve patch-based 3D medical image segmentation by integrating spatial location context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based methods in 3D segmentation often neglect spatial location within the global volume, despite its importance in providing anatomical context.

Method: Proposes LocBAM, a novel attention mechanism that explicitly processes spatial information, and evaluates it against datasets like BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23.

Result: Incorporating location context enhances training stability and segmentation accuracy, especially when global context is lacking.

Conclusion: LocBAM proves superior to coordinate encoding methods like CoordConv, improving performance in patch-based 3D segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data. However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important. In this paper, we investigate the role of location context in patch-based 3D segmentation and propose a novel attention mechanism, LocBAM, that explicitly processes spatial information. Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing. Furthermore, LocBAM consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/compai-lab/2026-ISBI-hooft

*Tobias Weißberg,Weikang Wang,Paul Roetzer,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to create symmetry-aware and symmetry-agnostic shape descriptors for 3D meshes, enhancing shape analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shape descriptors lack effective integration of symmetry-awareness with semantic information, creating gaps in shape analysis, symmetry detection, and robustness.

Method: The authors propose a feature disentanglement approach to construct symmetry-aware and symmetry-agnostic descriptors, alongside a feature refinement technique to reduce noise and misclassification.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves the effectiveness and robustness of symmetry-aware shape descriptors, addressing existing shortcomings.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTR is a post-training 3DGS codec that improves storage efficiency and inference speed for 3D scene reconstruction, surpassing other existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is faster than NeRF but requires higher storage, making it less efficient for practical use cases.

Method: POTR introduces a novel pruning approach to reduce splats, a method to recompute lighting coefficients for higher sparsity, and an optional fine-tuning step for enhanced performance.

Result: POTR reduces splats by 2-4x, speeds up inference by 1.5-2x, and increases lighting coefficient sparsity to 97%, all with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: POTR is a highly efficient compression solution for 3DGS, delivering superior rate-distortion performance and inference speed compared to other post-training techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: This system provides an equipment-independent and scalable solution, enhancing melanoma detection accuracy and bridging the gap between specialized and general clinical settings.

Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment. While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings. This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371. Results demonstrate that integrating photo images with metadata in a structured, multi-stage pipeline yields significant performance improvements. This system advances melanoma detection by providing a scalable, equipment-independent solution suitable for diverse healthcare environments, bridging the gap between specialized and general clinical practices.

*Sidi Mohamed Sid El Moctar,Achraf Ait Laydi,Yousef El Mourabit,Hélène Bouvrais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTFlow is a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation, offering trajectory-based refinement and interpretable processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately segmenting microtubule networks is crucial for studying their organization and dynamics, yet existing methods face challenges like filament curvature and image noise.

Method: MTFlow utilizes a U-Net backbone combined with temporal embeddings, iteratively refining noisy masks using flow-matching vector fields.

Result: MTFlow demonstrates competitive segmentation accuracy on microtubule datasets and generalizes well to other curvilinear structures like retinal blood vessels and nerves.

Conclusion: MTFlow is a time-efficient, powerful tool for microtubule segmentation, providing precise annotations superior to manual or semi-automatic approaches.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

### [135] [GAT-NeRF: Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced Neural Radiance Fields for High-Fidelity 4D Facial Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14875)
*Zhe Chang,Haodong Jin,Ying Sun,Yan Song,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAT-NeRF, a novel framework leveraging Transformer-enhanced Neural Radiance Fields for creating high-fidelity, dynamic 4D facial avatars from monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing demand for creating realistic virtual humans, but current Neural Radiance Fields struggle to capture fine facial details from limited data sources like monocular videos.

Method: The proposed Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF combines Multilayer Perceptron with a Geometry-Aware-Transformer module to process multimodal inputs (geometric priors, expression parameters, latent codes), enhancing feature representation and fine-detail recovery.

Result: Experimental results show that GAT-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity and detail recovery, especially for dynamic facial features, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: GAT-NeRF opens up new possibilities for detailed and realistic digital human creation, facilitating advancements in multimedia and virtual human applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

TL;DR: SpatialMem integrates 3D geometry, semantics, and language from egocentric video to create a unified queryable representation for indoor environments, supporting tasks like navigation and object retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a framework for spatial intelligence that enables efficient reasoning and interaction with indoor environments using minimal resources like casually captured RGB video.

Method: SpatialMem reconstructs environments metrically, detects structural 3D scaffolds like walls and doors, and organizes object nodes with linked textual descriptions and visual embeddings into a hierarchical memory for fast and compact retrieval.

Result: Tests on indoor scenes show that SpatialMem achieves strong performance in navigation and hierarchical retrieval tasks even under challenging conditions like high clutter and occlusion.

Conclusion: SpatialMem offers an extensible and efficient solution for embodied spatial intelligence, facilitating interpretable spatial reasoning and practical applications in complex indoor environments.

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

### [137] [Erosion Attack for Adversarial Training to Enhance Semantic Segmentation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14950)
*Yufei Song,Ziqi Zhou,Menghao Deng,Yifan Hu,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EroSeg-AT is a new adversarial training framework that enhances model robustness by focusing on semantic relationships and using EroSeg to create better adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing adversarial methods, which fail to exploit contextual semantic relationships and thus limit the effectiveness of adversarial training for segmentation models.

Method: The EroSeg-AT framework uses EroSeg to identify sensitive pixels based on confidence levels, then propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels to disrupt the semantic consistency of samples.

Result: The experiments show that EroSeg-AT outperforms existing approaches by improving attack effectiveness and providing better robustness against adversarial samples.

Conclusion: EroSeg-AT effectively enhances adversarial training by incorporating semantic-aware perturbations, resulting in more robust segmentation models.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

*Carolin Holtermann,Nina Krebs,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempViz, a dataset for evaluating temporal knowledge in text-to-image (T2I) models, and reveals their poor performance in generating temporally accurate images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal knowledge is critical in generating images that align with contextual changes over time (e.g., seasonal landscapes), a capability underexplored in T2I models.

Method: The authors create TempViz, a dataset of 7.9k prompts and 600+ reference images, and analyze the temporal capabilities of five T2I models across five knowledge categories.

Result: Human evaluation shows that T2I models struggle with temporal reasoning, with no model achieving more than 75% accuracy. Automated evaluation methods are unreliable for assessing temporal knowledge.

Conclusion: Current T2I models lack strong temporal competence, highlighting the need for further research in this domain to improve automated and human evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

### [139] [Towards Holistic Modeling for Video Frame Interpolation with Auto-regressive Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14959)
*Xinyu Peng,Han Li,Yuyang Huang,Ziyang Zheng,Yaoming Wang,Xin Chen,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a video-centric framework, LDF-VFI, for video frame interpolation that ensures temporal coherence and achieves state-of-the-art results, addressing limitations of prior frame-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video frame interpolation methods often lead to inconsistencies and artifacts due to their frame-centric processing approach. A holistic paradigm is needed to improve temporal coherence and quality.

Method: The proposed LDF-VFI framework utilizes an auto-regressive diffusion transformer with novel features such as skip-concatenate sampling, sparse local attention, tiled VAE encoding, and an enhanced conditional VAE decoder.

Result: LDF-VFI achieves superior per-frame quality, temporal consistency, and state-of-the-art performance on long-sequence benchmarks, while generalizing to high-resolution videos without retraining.

Conclusion: The presented methods effectively enhance video frame interpolation performance, particularly for scenes with large motion and long video sequences, positioning LDF-VFI as a robust solution.

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

### [140] [Unified Multi-Dataset Training for TBPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14978)
*Nilanjana Chatterjee,Sidharatha Garg,A V Subramanyam,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scale-TBPS, a unified model for text-based person search across multiple datasets, overcoming limitations of dataset-specific fine-tuning and addressing scalability and noise challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TBPS methods depend on dataset-specific fine-tuning, which results in inefficiency and multiple models, raising the need for a unified approach across datasets.

Method: The Scale-TBPS framework integrates a noise-aware dataset curation strategy and a scalable discriminative learning approach to handle challenges such as noisy data and a large pool of identities.

Result: Experiments on multiple TBPS datasets show that the unified Scale-TBPS model outperforms both fine-tuned dataset-specific models and naive joint training approaches.

Conclusion: Scale-TBPS successfully demonstrates a scalable approach to unified model training for TBPS, addressing limitations of current methods and achieving superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video evaluation benchmarks are focused on non-interactive videos, leaving a gap for benchmarks addressing interactive livestream video challenges.

Method: The paper proposes LiViBench, a benchmark featuring 24 diverse tasks, builds a semi-automatic annotation workflow using human-in-the-loop and MLLMs, and introduces tailored instruction-tuning methods and the Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve model understanding.

Result: LiVi-LLM-7B, a model developed through the proposed methods, outperforms larger open-source models by up to 72B parameters and narrows the performance gap with proprietary models on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: LiViBench and LiVi-LLM-7B enhance the capability of MLLMs for interactive livestream video understanding, addressing the benchmark gap and improving general video benchmark performance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel video-to-audio generation framework focusing on binaural spatial perception by using a new large-scale dataset and a spatial audio generation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-audio models emphasize semantic and temporal alignment but lack in spatial perception and immersive audio quality due to reliance on mono audio datasets.

Method: A dataset called BinauralVGGSound is introduced alongside an end-to-end framework featuring a visual-guided audio spatialization module to generate spatially immersive audio.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates significantly improved spatial fidelity and immersive audio quality compared to state-of-the-art models, while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.

Conclusion: This work advances spatially-aware video-to-audio systems and provides valuable resources for future research, enhancing immersive auditory experiences.

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative brain tumor analysis across institutions while preserving patient privacy.

Method: The paper introduces a federated learning framework using a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network deployed on CERN’s platform, with attention-based explainability analysis.

Result: Federated learning outperformed isolated institution-wise training and matched centralized models' performance when tested on the BraTS dataset, and highlighted the importance of T2 and FLAIR modalities in deeper network layers.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a powerful approach for leveraging distributed data in complex healthcare tasks, ensuring privacy and improving model performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing deep leakage attacks in terms of instability, limited fidelity, and lack of robustness in federated learning settings.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the data reconstruction process during FL, guiding optimization to align with realistic data distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and models show superior performance of the method against state-of-the-art attacks on various similarity metrics. It proves its effectiveness across training conditions, client batch sizes, and under defense mechanisms like noise injection and sparsification.

Conclusion: The study highlights the urgent need for new defense strategies in federated learning that consider adversaries capable of leveraging advanced generative priors.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anonymization methods fail to balance privacy protection and data utility in privacy-preserving machine learning, necessitating efficient synthetic data generation.

Method: The proposed framework adopts an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent (EFSGD) method, incorporates reconstruction loss, and uses noise injection during training to enhance privacy and data utility.

Result: The framework achieves higher image quality and usability under the same privacy budget compared to existing methods. It outperforms across metrics on benchmarks such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

Conclusion: The introduced framework successfully enhances the balance between privacy and utility, offering state-of-the-art outcomes for synthetic data generation in various benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new plug-and-play framework to improve CLIP-based FG-BG decomposition for better few-shot OOD detection, addressing adaptive background suppression and confusable foreground rectification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG methods overlook varying contributions of background patches and fail to address foreground patches with appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, thus limiting few-shot OOD detection performance.

Method: The framework includes three modules: FG-BG decomposition module, Adaptive Background Suppression module using patch classification entropy, and Confusable Foreground Rectification module to fix misleading foreground patches.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvement in existing FG-BG decomposition approaches using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances few-shot OOD detection by addressing key challenges in FG-BG decomposition methods and offers a practical solution with publicly available code.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

*Jingyang Huo,Yikai Wang,Yanwei Fu,Jianfeng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing visual images from fMRI brain data across different individuals without requiring subject-specific training, using a novel dataset (UniCortex-fMRI) and a new model (PictorialCortex).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of decoding visual experiences from brain activity despite the variability in cortical responses due to individual and experimental differences. This is vital for advancing neuroscientific understanding and brain-computer interfaces.

Method: The authors introduce the UniCortex-fMRI dataset and propose the PictorialCortex model. PictorialCortex uses a compositional latent formulation to account for variability in neural activity and employs latent factorization-composition with consistency regularization. A diffusion-based synthesis is then used to reconstruct images.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the PictorialCortex model significantly improves the zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction process, showcasing the effectiveness of its latent modeling and use of multi-dataset training.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of compositional latent modeling and standardized datasets in achieving cross-subject visual reconstruction, pushing the boundaries of neuroscience and artificial intelligence integration.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pb4U-GNet, a graph neural network framework optimized for garment simulation, which overcomes resolution-dependence issues and achieves strong performance across varied mesh resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of high computational expense in conventional physics-based garment simulation methods and the poor cross-resolution generalization in existing graph neural network approaches.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a resolution-adaptive framework, Pb4U-GNet, with dynamic propagation depth control and geometry-aware update scaling to enhance generalization on garment meshes of varying resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pb4U-GNet, even when trained only on low-resolution meshes, performs effectively across diverse mesh resolutions.

Conclusion: Pb4U-GNet resolves fundamental cross-resolution issues in graph neural network-based garment simulation, making it more practical for time-sensitive applications like virtual try-on and digital human modeling.

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

*Shuonan Yang,Yuchen Zhang,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARS, a training-free, multi-stage framework for detecting hateful video content, combining objective content analysis, evidence-based reasoning, and explainable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing hateful video detection methods that rely on limited training data and lack interpretability, while improving reliability compared to direct use of large vision-language models.

Method: MARS uses a multi-stage process: first objectively describing video content, then reasoning with evidence-based and counter-evidence perspectives, synthesizing into an explainable decision.

Result: MARS improves detection performance by up to 10% compared to other training-free methods, outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset, and provides interpretable justifications.

Conclusion: The MARS framework enhances both the effectiveness and transparency of hateful video content detection, supporting content moderation and compliance oversight.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of promptable segmentation models to real-world variations in bounding box prompts using both a user study and adversarial prompt generation (BREPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how sensitive promptable segmentation models like SAM are to natural noise in bounding box prompts, particularly since existing methods rely mainly on synthetic prompt generation.

Method: The study involves a user study to collect real bounding box annotations, introduces a method called BREPS for generating adversarial bounding boxes, and benchmarks performance across 10 datasets.

Result: The study finds significant variability in segmentation quality due to natural prompt noise and demonstrates that BREPS can effectively evaluate robustness by generating challenging prompts.

Conclusion: Segmentation models are highly sensitive to real-world bounding box prompt variability, highlighting a need for more robust training and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraSP (Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction), a new method to extract and recognize visual graphs from images, overcoming challenges in task transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of visual relationship recognition (extraction of a graph from an image) that currently lacks a canonical, transferable approach.

Method: The authors propose GraSP, a method that focuses on recognizing graphs in images via subgraph prediction, aiming for broad applicability across different graph types and image contexts.

Result: The GraSP method is evaluated across synthetic benchmarks and a real-world scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness and ability to transfer across tasks without specific modifications.

Conclusion: GraSP takes a step towards a unified framework for visual graph recognition, showcasing its versatility and simplifying task transferability.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

Method: The authors compiled 100,000+ papers from 22 major conferences (2020-2025) and applied topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval techniques for analysis.

Result: The analysis uncovered trends like growing interest in safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, while areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods show stabilization.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive, evidence-based representation of AI research trends and delivers a resource for understanding emerging directions and shifts in research focus.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

TL;DR: PMPose is a 2D pose estimator enhancing performance in crowded scenes, integrated into BMPv2 for improved benchmarks surpassing state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D human pose benchmarks are nearly saturated except for crowded scenes, prompting the development of PMPose to address performance issues in these scenarios.

Method: PMPose uses a probabilistic formulation and mask-conditioning for pose estimation in crowded scenes. BMPv2 combines PMPose with an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module for higher accuracy.

Result: BMPv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1.5 AP points improvement on COCO and 6 AP points improvement on OCHuman datasets, exceeding 50 AP on OCHuman for the first time.

Conclusion: Enhancing 2D pose estimation, especially in crowded scenes, directly benefits multi-person 3D pose estimation. BMPv2 establishes a new benchmark while facilitating cross-modality improvements.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes multiple models for Alzheimer's disease MRI classification, showing the hybrid model Evan_V2 achieves the best accuracy (99.99%) and minimizes misclassifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to enable timely medical intervention and stronger patient outcomes.

Method: The study compares CNN architectures, Transformer models, and a hybrid ensemble model called Evan_V2 on four-class AD classification using feature-level fusion.

Result: Evan_V2 achieved top performance (accuracy: 99.99%, F1-score: 0.9989, ROC AUC: 0.9968) and reduced misclassification across dementia stages.

Conclusion: Hybrid ensemble models like Evan_V2 greatly enhance accuracy and reliability in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, outperforming individual architectures.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

*Hanlei Guo,Jiahao Shao,Xinya Chen,Xiyang Tan,Sheng Miao,Yujun Shen,Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScenDi, a method for generating realistic 3D urban scenes using combined 3D and 2D diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating detailed and realistic 3D urban scenes is challenging due to limitations in existing methods relying solely on 3D or 2D diffusion models.

Method: ScenDi integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models. A 3D latent diffusion model generates low-resolution 3D scenes, which can be conditionally controlled. A 2D video diffusion model enhances the appearance details of these scenes.

Result: Experiments conducted on Waymo and KITTI-360 datasets show the effectiveness of ScenDi in generating realistic 3D urban scenes with controllable synthesis and accurate camera trajectories.

Conclusion: ScenDi overcomes the limitations of current approaches by combining 3D and 2D diffusion models to produce detailed and controllable urban scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Progress-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on task progress reasoning, and proposes methods to improve their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at recognizing visible content, can also assess task progress by reasoning over long-horizon dynamics, which is critical for understanding complex tasks.

Method: The authors present Progress-Bench for evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs, explore training-free and training-based (using curated dataset ProgressLM-45K) approaches, and conduct experiments to understand model performance and limitations.

Result: Most VLMs struggle with task progress estimation, showing limitations in handling modality or viewpoint changes and unanswerable cases. However, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements across tasks.

Conclusion: While VLMs show limitations in progress reasoning, structured training approaches can significantly enhance their capabilities, offering insights into conditions for success or failure in such tasks.

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for precise and efficient automated methods for detecting cervical spine fractures in medical imaging, which are critical for clinical management.

Method: It proposes a 2D projection-based approach for vertebra segmentation, utilizing YOLOv8 for localization, DenseNet121-Unet for segmentation, and a 2.5D Spatio-Sequential model ensemble for fracture detection.

Result: The method achieved a 3D mIoU of 94.45%, a Dice score of 87.86%, and vertebra- and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, with ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of 2D projection-based methods for efficient and accurate cervical spine analysis, validated through explainability studies and interobserver comparisons with expert radiologists.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

Result: DrivIng provides ~1.2 million annotated driving instances, supports systematic simulation and real-world scenario transfers, and is benchmarked with state-of-the-art perception models to validate its applicability.

Conclusion: DrivIng advances autonomous driving research by offering a comprehensive dataset and tools, fostering reproducible, robust testing and enabling the development of reliable perception algorithms.

Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.

*Yu Wu,Minsik Jeon,Jen-Hao Rick Chang,Oncel Tuzel,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RayRoPE, a novel positional encoding mechanism for multi-view transformers that uniquely encodes image patches, achieves SE(3)-invariant attention, and adapts to scene geometry. It improves performance on tasks like novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encoding schemes for multi-view transformers fail to uniquely encode patches, achieve SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and adapt to the scene's geometry. This paper seeks to address these shortcomings.

Method: The paper proposes RayRoPE, an encoding mechanism that represents patch positions using rays with a predicted geometry-aware point instead of relying solely on direction. It ensures SE(3) invariance through query-frame projective coordinates and handles positional uncertainty analytically.

Result: RayRoPE achieves significant performance improvements in novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation tasks, surpassing existing encoding schemes. For instance, it provides a 15% improvement on LPIPS in the CO3D dataset and also improves when incorporating RGB-D input.

Conclusion: RayRoPE effectively addresses the limitations of prior encoding schemes for multi-view transformers by introducing a geometry-aware and robust positional encoding that enhances performance in various computer vision tasks.

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation by introducing StableWorld, a method to mitigate error accumulation during long-term interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to solve the challenge of instability and temporal degradation, such as spatial drift and scene collapse, in interactive video generation, which hinders long-term usability.

Method: They propose StableWorld, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism that filters out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones to prevent cumulative drift in video generation.

Result: The proposed StableWorld method shows improved stability, temporal consistency, and generalization on interactive video models like Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft.

Conclusion: StableWorld successfully mitigates error accumulation in interactive video generation and is model-agnostic, enhancing performance across varying systems and scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective system for real-time, high-quality light editing in indoor scenes, showcasing advancements in lighting manipulation and decomposition while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

*Anurag Bagchi,Zhipeng Bao,Homanga Bharadhwaj,Yu-Xiong Wang,Pavel Tokmakov,Martial Hebert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a method that adapts pretrained video diffusion models into action-conditioned world models for controllable future prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling video generation models to predict plausible, action-conditioned future events accurately, improving their applicability in navigation and manipulation tasks.

Method: The EgoWM approach utilizes pretrained video diffusion models enriched with action priors through lightweight conditioning layers, rather than training from scratch, ensuring realism and precision while promoting scalability across embodiments.

Result: EgoWM demonstrated improved Structural Consistency Score (up to 80%) compared to state-of-the-art models, lower inference latency (six times lower), and robust generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: EgoWM successfully repurposes pretrained video models for action-conditioned prediction tasks, offering advancements in realism, efficiency, and versatility across various robotic systems.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

*Gautom Das,Vincent La,Ethan Lau,Abhinav Shrivastava,Matthew Gwilliam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores quantization methods to reduce memory and latency in multimodal pipelines involving vision and language models, while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the resource intensity of large language models, aiming to reduce memory and latency via quantization, allowing for more efficient deployments without degrading performance.

Method: The authors investigate various quantization methods such as GPTQ and AWQ on multimodal systems (vision, language models, and their connections), analyzing effects of bit widths and quantization approaches on performance in tasks like captioning and question answering.

Result: Results showed that both vision transformers (ViT) and large language models (LLMs) were of comparable importance for performance, and that lower-bit quantization of LLMs maintained high accuracy at reduced storage requirements.

Conclusion: Lower-bit quantization effectively balances performance and efficiency, providing insights for practical deployment of multimodal language models (MLLMs).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

### [165] [APPLE: Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling for Diffusion-Based Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15288)
*Jiwon Kang,Yeji Choi,JoungBin Lee,Wooseok Jang,Jinhyeok Choi,Taekeun Kang,Yongjae Park,Myungin Kim,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, APPLE, for face swapping, aiming to enhance attribute fidelity and identity transfer using a diffusion-based teacher-student setup and attribute-aware pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face swapping methods struggle to balance accurate identity transfer and the preservation of detailed target-specific attributes due to the lack of real ground truth. Existing diffusion-based approaches produce visually plausible results but often fail at aligning attributes properly.

Method: The authors introduce APPLE, a diffusion-based teacher-student framework utilizing attribute-aware pseudo-labeling. The method reformulates face swapping as a conditional deblurring task and designs an attribute-aware inversion scheme to preserve intricate attribute details.

Result: APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing photorealistic and target-faithful face-swapping results.

Conclusion: The proposed APPLE framework effectively addresses the challenges in face swapping by improving attribute fidelity and identity transfer quality, demonstrating superior results compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JAXMg, a library enabling multi-GPU dense linear algebra in JAX, aimed at solving dense linear systems and eigenvalue problems efficiently in Python workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of scaling dense linear algebra operations beyond a single GPU in Python workflows while maintaining ease of integration and compatibility with JIT-compiled frameworks.

Method: The authors developed JAXMg, which integrates JAX with NVIDIA's cuSOLVERMg via XLA Foreign Function Interface, introducing JIT-compatible JAX primitives for multi-GPU execution.

Result: JAXMg allows seamless incorporation of scalable multi-GPU linear algebra capabilities into JAX workflows, preserving composability and enabling efficient memory usage beyond single-GPU confines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that JAXMg successfully bridges the gap between high-performance multi-GPU libraries and JAX-based Python workflows, facilitating large-scale linear algebra operations.

Abstract: Solving large dense linear systems and eigenvalue problems is a core requirement in many areas of scientific computing, but scaling these operations beyond a single GPU remains challenging within modern programming frameworks. While highly optimized multi-GPU solver libraries exist, they are typically difficult to integrate into composable, just-in-time (JIT) compiled Python workflows. JAXMg provides multi-GPU dense linear algebra for JAX, enabling Cholesky-based linear solves and symmetric eigendecompositions for matrices that exceed single-GPU memory limits. By interfacing JAX with NVIDIA's cuSOLVERMg through an XLA Foreign Function Interface, JAXMg exposes distributed GPU solvers as JIT-compatible JAX primitives. This design allows scalable linear algebra to be embedded directly within JAX programs, preserving composability with JAX transformations and enabling multi-GPU execution in end-to-end scientific workflows.

*Torben R. Lahnor,Mia Reitz,Jonas Posner,Patrick Diehl*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper integrates Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC AMTs into Task Bench and evaluates them in performance and programmer productivity against MPI and HPX, showcasing distinct trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and fairly compare different AMTs and their capabilities in terms of efficiency and productivity.

Method: Integrating Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC into Task Bench and assessing their performance using application efficiency and METG, and programmer productivity via LOC and NLC, across various configurations.

Result: MPI excels in efficiency for communication-light tasks but lacks in productivity. HPX is balanced under load imbalance but ranks lowest in productivity. Itoyori leads in efficiency for communication-heavy tasks and programmer productivity, while ItoyoriFBC offers potential for irregular workloads with slightly lower efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights that no single system is ideal for all cases, with trade-offs between efficiency, productivity, and workload compatibility.

Abstract: Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) runtimes offer a productive alternative to the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, the diverse AMT landscape makes fair comparisons challenging. Task Bench, proposed by Slaughter et al., addresses this challenge through a parameterized framework for evaluating parallel programming systems. This work integrates two recent cluster AMTs, Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC, into Task Bench for comprehensive evaluation against MPI and HPX. Itoyori employs a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model with RDMA-based work stealing, while ItoyoriFBC extends it with futurebased synchronization.
  We evaluate these systems in terms of both performance and programmer productivity. Performance is assessed across various configurations, including compute-bound kernels, weak scaling, and both imbalanced and communication-intensive patterns. Performance is quantified using application efficiency, i.e., the percentage of maximum performance achieved, and the Minimum Effective Task Granularity (METG), i.e., the smallest task duration before runtime overheads dominate. Programmer productivity is quantified using Lines of Code (LOC) and the Number of Library Constructs (NLC).
  Our results reveal distinct trade-offs. MPI achieves the highest efficiency for regular, communication-light workloads but requires verbose, lowlevel code. HPX maintains stable efficiency under load imbalance across varying node counts, yet ranks last in productivity metrics, demonstrating that AMTs do not inherently guarantee improved productivity over MPI. Itoyori achieves the highest efficiency in communication-intensive configurations while leading in programmer productivity. ItoyoriFBC exhibits slightly lower efficiency than Itoyori, though its future-based synchronization offers potential for expressing irregular workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge of scheduling jobs with hard deadlines in hybrid cloud environments using unreliable spot instances and costly on-demand instances.

Method: They develop a randomized scheduling algorithm, ROSS, which improves upon deterministic policies ensuring a competitive ratio of $\sqrt{K}$.

Result: Extensive evaluations indicate that ROSS outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 30% cost savings on Azure and AWS real-world trace data.

Conclusion: ROSS provides an effective solution for deadline-aware scheduling in hybrid clouds while minimizing costs and adhering to deadlines.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deadline-aware online scheduling for jobs in hybrid cloud environments, where jobs may run on either cost-effective but unreliable spot instances or more expensive on-demand instances, under hard deadlines. We first establish a fundamental limit for existing (predominantly-) deterministic policies, proving a worst-case competitive ratio of $Ω(K)$, where $K$ is the cost ratio between on-demand and spot instances. We then present a novel randomized scheduling algorithm, ROSS, that achieves a provably optimal competitive ratio of $\sqrt{K}$ under reasonable deadlines, significantly improving upon existing approaches. Extensive evaluations on real-world trace data from Azure and AWS demonstrate that ROSS effectively balances cost optimization and deadline guarantees, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to $30\%$ in cost savings, across diverse spot market conditions.

*Guillaume Ambal,Max Stupple,Brijesh Dongol,Azalea Raad*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper develops a formal semantics for remote synchronisation in RDMA to verify common abstractions like locks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RDMA programming models lack formalised remote synchronisation semantics, limiting the verification of abstractions like locks.

Method: The paper introduces RDMA semantics for remote read-modify-write operations, develops synchronisation abstractions, and verifies remote locks under these semantics.

Result: Three classes of remote locks are specified, implemented, and verified. A strong RDMA model is proposed for sequential consistency.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in RDMA programmability, making high-performance libraries like LOCO compatible and formal verifications feasible.

Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.

*Varad Kulkarni,Vaibhav Jha,Nikhil Reddy,Yogesh Simmhan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes FAME, a FaaS-based architecture designed to orchestrate multi-agent AI workflows using serverless platforms, showing significant efficiency improvements in cost, latency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous AI agents and MCP-enabled workflows faces challenges in scale, elasticity, and state management in traditional cloud deployments. Current VM-based solutions are resource-heavy, while FaaS platforms lack state persistence but offer better scalability and cost-efficiency.

Method: The authors designed FAME, which restructures agentic workflows into modular FaaS components like Planner, Actor, and Evaluator. It utilizes AWS serverless services to manage memory persistence, optimize context handling, and improve request management with tools like DynamoDB, S3, and AWS Lambda.

Result: Evaluations on two applications (research paper summarization and log analytics) revealed significant performance gains, including up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens, 66% cost savings, and enhanced workflow completion rates.

Conclusion: FAME proves that serverless platforms can effectively manage complex multi-agent workflows, offering tangible benefits in scalability, cost savings, and execution efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale AI applications.

Abstract: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.

Result: AlertGuardian achieves 94.8% alert reduction, 90.5% diagnosis accuracy, and improves alert rules with a 32% acceptance rate by Site Reliability Engineers (SREs).

Conclusion: AlertGuardian significantly enhances alert management, mitigating alert fatigue and facilitating fault diagnosis. Success stories and insights from deployment in Company-X are also included.

Abstract: Alerts are critical for detecting anomalies in large-scale cloud systems, ensuring reliability and user experience. However, current systems generate overwhelming volumes of alerts, degrading operational efficiency due to ineffective alert life-cycle management. This paper details the efforts of Company-X to optimize alert life-cycle management, addressing alert fatigue in cloud systems. We propose AlertGuardian, a framework collaborating large language models (LLMs) and lightweight graph models to optimize the alert life-cycle through three phases: Alert Denoise uses graph learning model with virtual noise to filter noise, Alert Summary employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to create actionable summary, and Alert Rule Refinement leverages multi-agent iterative feedbacks to improve alert rule quality. Evaluated on four real-world datasets from Company-X's services, AlertGuardian significantly mitigates alert fatigue (94.8\% alert reduction ratios) and accelerates fault diagnosis (90.5\% diagnosis accuracy). Moreover, AlertGuardian improves 1,174 alert rules, with 375 accepted by SREs (32% acceptance rate). Finally, we share success stories and lessons learned about alert life-cycle management after the deployment of AlertGuardian in Company-X.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated three-phase collaborative privacy-preserving ADMM algorithm (3P-ADMM-PC2) for distributed edge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of limited single-edge node computing power, risk of information leakage, and high communication overhead in conventional distributed computing methods.

Method: A three-phase collaborative distributed ADMM algorithm is proposed with Paillier homomorphic encryption for data privacy and a quantization technique for computational efficiency. High-bitwidth computations are adapted for GPU use to enhance parallel encryption and decryption.

Result: The 3P-ADMM-PC2 achieves excellent mean square error comparable to non-privacy-preserving methods and significantly improves computational speed with GPU acceleration over centralized and CPU-based distributed methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances privacy-preserving distributed computing in edge networks, achieving strong performance and significant computational speed improvements.

Abstract: Distributed computing has been widely applied in distributed edge networks for reducing the processing burden of high-dimensional data centralization, where a high-dimensional computational task is decomposed into multiple low-dimensional collaborative processing tasks or multiple edge nodes use distributed data to train a global model. However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large-integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving. Compared to centralized ADMM and distributed ADMM implemented with Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a significant speedup ratio.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline for converting noisy, unstructured call center audio recordings into high-quality Q&A datasets, enabling the fine-tuning of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific applications requires high-quality instructional datasets, which are difficult to generate from noisy and unstructured sources like call center recordings.

Method: The pipeline involves audio processing (diarization, noise removal, transcription), text processing (normalization, anonymization), semantic extraction (via vector embeddings), and Q&A pair formation using semantic search.

Result: The pipeline successfully generated a complete Q&A instructional dataset, which was effectively used to fine-tune an LLM (Llama 2 7B), proving its feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates a practical solution for utilizing unstructured conversational data in creating fine-tuning datasets, with significant potential for improving AI-driven customer service applications.

Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how diffusion language models respond to adversarial attacks, and the study aims to evaluate their robustness and attack resilience.

Method: Adversarial prompt attacks were applied to the LLaDA model using techniques such as prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, with harmful prompts from the AdvBench dataset.

Result: Initial insights into vulnerabilities of diffusion language models were highlighted, showing room for improvement in attack analyses and robustness.

Conclusion: Diffusion language models show distinct attack surfaces, and there is a need for enhanced optimization strategies and adversarial evaluation methods for these models.

Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework called DnR that explicitly divides and refines multimodal representations for emotion recognition in conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing multimodal emotion recognition by integrating modality-specific, redundant, and synergistic cues while addressing challenges in data preparation.

Method: Two-phase framework named Divide and Refine (DnR). The Divide phase decomposes modalities into distinct contributions, and the Refine phase enhances informativeness while preserving roles.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate improved performance across multiple MERC backbones using DnR.

Conclusion: Explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations improves emotion recognition and is a promising approach for multimodal pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

*Zewen Yang,Xiaobing Dai,Jiajun Cheng,Yulong Huang,Peng Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a selective online learning framework called EIGP for distributed Gaussian process regression, focusing on prioritizing model quality over quantity in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency in distributed learning caused by indiscriminate inclusion of all models, emphasizing the importance of choosing high-quality models for cooperation.

Method: The proposed framework, EIGP, includes a selection function to assess and choose high-quality models. Extensions such as gEIGP (for speed) and aEIGP (for accuracy) enhance the framework. Real-time operations are facilitated with fast prediction and model update strategies.

Result: Numerical simulations show that EIGP outperforms other distributed GP methods across different benchmarks.

Conclusion: The EIGP framework effectively improves prediction accuracy and efficiency in distributed multi-agent systems, underlining the critical role of selecting quality models for better cooperation.

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

TL;DR: The study focuses on predicting vehicle behavior in on and off-ramps by comparing these areas to straight highway sections using a multi-layered LSTM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety and reduce uncertainty on understudied road areas like on and off-ramps by understanding their interaction dynamics.

Method: The authors use a multi-layered LSTM architecture trained with the ExiD drone dataset, testing different prediction horizons and workflows.

Result: The model achieved promising results, with prediction accuracy of 76% for on and off-ramps and 94% for straight highway areas on a horizon of up to 4 seconds.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential for enhancing road safety by accurately predicting vehicle behavior in complex road sections such as on and off-ramps.

Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

### [180] [Which Quantization Should I Use? A Unified Evaluation of llama.cpp Quantization on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14277)
*Uygar Kurt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides an empirical study of various quantization formats for the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, aiding in deployment decisions on constrained hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make large language models more deployable on constrained hardware using quantization techniques and provide clarity on choosing quantization schemes.

Method: Empirical evaluation of llama.cpp quantization schemes on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, assessing performance across benchmarks, perplexity, CPU throughput, and compression.

Result: Findings guide readers in selecting appropriate quantization schemes by presenting performance metrics across different formats and use cases.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a practical resource for deploying large language models effectively using llama.cpp quantization on resource-constrained hardware environments.

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

### [181] [On the Limits of Learned Importance Scoring for KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14279)
*Brady Steele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates KV cache compression using Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), finding it underperforms simpler baselines on importance prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve KV cache compression methods by investigating the effectiveness of Speculative Importance Prediction models for predicting token importance.

Method: The authors propose using a small SIP model (1.7M parameters) with architectural features like multi-horizon lookahead and cross-attention to assess token importance from KV representations.

Result: SIP does not outperform simpler baselines like position-based heuristics and prefill attention signal for token retention across multiple tasks and experimental setups.

Conclusion: Position-based heuristics and prefill attention signals are as or more effective than complex SIP methods; limited information appears present in KV representations for predicting token importance.

Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

### [182] [Beyond Denial-of-Service: The Puppeteer's Attack for Fine-Grained Control in Ranking-Based Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14687)
*Zhihao Chen,Zirui Gong,Jianting Ning,Yanjun Zhang,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract introduces Federated Rank Learning (FRL) as a robust FL paradigm using discrete rankings for communication, resistant against malicious attacks. However, a novel Edge Control Attack (ECA) exploits weaknesses, demonstrating the need for improved security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FRL aims to enhance robustness in Federated Learning applications, particularly in sensitive and secure systems, by using ranking-based updates to minimize vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks.

Method: The researchers introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), a fine-grained poisoning attack in FRL frameworks, exploiting ranking mechanisms in two stages: manipulating edges and stabilizing global model accuracy to degrade performance unnoticed.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that ECA achieves precision in degrading model accuracy across multiple datasets and aggregation rules, with an average error of only 0.224%, showing effectiveness far beyond traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Federated Rank Learning, while reducing vulnerabilities, still falls susceptible to advanced Edge Control Attacks, stressing the need for more robust defenses in securing federated systems.

Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

### [183] [Beyond Affinity: A Benchmark of 1D, 2D, and 3D Methods Reveals Critical Trade-offs in Structure-Based Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14283)
*Kangyu Zheng,Kai Zhang,Jiale Tan,Xuehan Chen,Yingzhou Lu,Zaixi Zhang,Lichao Sun,Marinka Zitnik,Tianfan Fu,Zhiding Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks 15 models across search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning in structure-based drug design (SBDD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of cross-algorithm comparisons in SBDD, enabling a better understanding of different methodologies' strengths and weaknesses.

Method: The authors benchmark 15 models from three algorithmic categories by evaluating molecule properties, docking affinities, and poses with target proteins.

Result: Key findings include: 3D models excel in binding affinity but lack chemical validity; 1D models perform well chemically but not in binding affinity; and 2D models are balanced.

Conclusion: The research identifies improvement areas for each algorithm category and recommends combining their strengths to advance SBDD. Coding resources are open-source.

Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

### [184] [A Comparison of Polynomial-Based Tree Clustering Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14285)
*Pengyu Liu,Mariel Vázquez,Nataša Jonoska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates tree clustering methods using tree polynomials and highlights normalized distance methods as offering high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance computational tools for analyzing biological tree structures as these are key for understanding RNA functions, phylogenetics, and other areas in life sciences.

Method: Different tree clustering methods are compared using a tree distinguishing polynomial, and two autoencoder models for clustering based on these polynomials are implemented.

Result: Methods using normalized distances between tree polynomials demonstrate the highest clustering accuracy.

Conclusion: Normalized distance-based tree clustering is effective and computationally efficient for analyzing structured biological data.

Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents engGNN, a dual-graph framework combining external and data-driven graphs to enhance omics data analysis, offering improved predictive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in analyzing high-dimensional omics data, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, by integrating prior biological knowledge and addressing limitations of current graph neural network models that rely on single graph types.

Method: This study proposes engGNN, which combines an external undirected biological feature graph from databases and a directed feature graph generated via tree-ensemble models, creating a dual-graph framework for comprehensive embeddings.

Result: engGNN achieves superior performance on gene expression data compared to state-of-the-art baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and interpretability through simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: engGNN is a robust framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery, offering enhanced performance and feature importance insights useful for pathway enrichment analysis.

Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.

### [186] [RadixMLP -- Intra-batch Deduplication for Causal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15013)
*Michael Feil,Julius Lipp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RadixMLP, a method to optimize batch inference for causal transformer models by reducing redundant computation of shared prefixes, improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in standard inference engines for causal transformer models that redundantly compute identical MLP activations for shared prefixes, like system prompts or shared queries.

Method: RadixMLP maps batches into prefix tries to compress shared segments for efficient computation, using a stateless, position-wise processing technique within one forward pass.

Result: RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59x speedups in realistic reranking workloads and up to 5x in synthetically benchmarked workloads with longer shared prefixes.

Conclusion: RadixMLP significantly enhances efficiency for transformer model batch inference by optimizing shared computation in prefix-heavy workloads. Code availability ensures reproducibility and broader adoption.

Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

*Xiucheng Xu,Bingbing Xu,Xueyun Tian,Zihe Huang,Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a framework for efficient external memory systems in LLMs that focuses on lightweight memory construction and sophisticated utilization, achieving superior accuracy and reduced computational costs compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current external memory systems for LLMs caused by expensive memory construction and ineffective retrieval-augmented generation.

Method: CoM incorporates a Chain-of-Memory mechanism to dynamically organize retrieved memory fragments into inference paths, using adaptive truncation to remove irrelevant noise.

Result: CoM achieves accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4% on benchmarks while consuming significantly fewer tokens and reducing latency compared to complex memory systems.

Conclusion: The proposed CoM framework enhances external memory systems for LLMs by balancing computational efficiency with reasoning performance, paving the way for more scalable and effective solutions.

Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

*Bostan Khan,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFedNAS addresses the inefficiency in Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) by introducing an optimized supernet training mechanism and immediate subnet discovery through a multi-objective fitness function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in FedNAS: suboptimal supernet training and lengthy pipelines for subnet discovery.

Method: The framework uses Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training with a pre-computed cache of high-fitness architectures, alongside a Predictor-Free Search Method for fast subnet discovery.

Result: DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, improved efficiency in parameters and communication, and reduces post-training search time by ~61x compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: DeepFedNAS significantly accelerates and simplifies FedNAS, making hardware-aware FL deployments highly practical and efficient.

Abstract: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses hard-label black-box attacks by reframing them as gradient sign recovery tasks. It proposes a new attack framework based on frequency domain initialization and Pattern-Driven Optimization, achieving higher success rates and query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the constrained hard-label black-box attack setting by exploring methods to recover meaningful gradient information from discrete predictions, enhancing model understanding and attack efficiency.

Method: The authors developed a new framework combining zero-query frequency domain initialization and Pattern-Driven Optimization strategy, supported by theoretical guarantees for higher accuracy and lower query complexity.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved attack success rates and query efficiency in experiments across various datasets and models, outperforming existing methods. It also generalizes to different tasks while circumventing stateful defenses.

Conclusion: The proposed method represents a significant improvement in hard-label black-box attack strategies, showing potential in broad applications while offering robust efficiency and effectiveness against defenses.

Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies and underutilized experts during pre-training of MoE Large Language Models.

Method: Proposes a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning algorithm that selectively prunes experts during pre-training and reorganizes them based on token distribution.

Result: LAEP enhances training efficiency by 48.3%, reduces parameters by 33.3%, and maintains excellent model performance.

Conclusion: The LAEP algorithm optimizes MoE training by reducing computational cost and improving efficiency, making it practical for large-scale language model development.

Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework tailored for the dynamic environment of fantasy sports, enhancing recommendation quality and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges faced by traditional Contextual Bandit algorithms in adapting to the highly dynamic environments of fantasy sports, where frequent updates and contextual shifts are critical for maintaining personalization effectiveness.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity, leveraging contextual similarity for policy transfer and integrating uplift modeling principles to enhance adaptability and mitigate cold-start issues.

Result: Large-scale A/B testing on Dream11 demonstrated a 0.4% revenue increase and improved user satisfaction metrics. Deployment as the default system in 2025 resulted in an additional 0.5% revenue improvement.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in dynamic environments, proving its potential in real-world systems with measurable performance improvements in revenue and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for handling class imbalance and adapting to cross-domain log anomaly detection scenarios.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is essential for system reliability, but it is extremely challenging to do considering it involves class imbalance. Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported. Our empirical findings validate that the proposed meta-learning-driven approach yielded the highest mean F1 score and proved to be effective for cross-domain settings.

### [193] [DiSPA: Differential Substructure-Pathway Attention for Drug Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14346)
*Yewon Han,Sunghyun Kim,Eunyi Jeong,Sungkyung Lee,Seokwoo Yun,Sangsoo Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSPA is a new deep learning framework for predicting drug response mechanisms by disentangling structure-driven and context-driven interactions through a differential cross-attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods often fail to handle context-dependent mechanisms and high-dimensional noise in biological networks, impacting precision medicine's ability to predict drug responses accurately.

Method: DiSPA leverages bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. It uses a differential cross-attention module to filter spurious data and amplify relevant interactions.

Result: DiSPA outperforms on the GDSC benchmark, generalizes well to unseen drug-cell combinations, provides mechanistically informative representations, and allows zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a robust and interpretable approach for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enhancing precision medicine by enabling detailed analyses of drug response mechanisms.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.

### [194] [VJEPA: Variational Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures as Probabilistic World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14354)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational JEPA (VJEPA), a probabilistic model improving joint embedding predictive architectures for self-supervised learning by predicting distributions over latent states, enhancing applications like optimal control and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of deterministic objectives in JEPA models, which hinder their probabilistic representation and applicability in stochastic control, aiming to make these architectures scalable and robust in noisy, high-dimensional environments.

Method: VJEPA utilizes a variational objective to predict distributions over latent states, unifying representation learning with PSRs and Bayesian filtering. It avoids autoregressive observations and guarantees avoiding representation collapse. BJEPA extends VJEPA by decoupling beliefs into dynamics and modular prior experts for enhanced transferability and constraint implementations.

Result: Empirical experiments in noisy environments show that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out nuisance distractors, avoiding representation collapse experienced in generative baselines, while supporting uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: VJEPA and its Bayesian extension (BJEPA) present a foundational framework for uncertainty-aware, scalable, and robust planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments while sidestepping the challenges of autoregressive observation likelihoods and pixel reconstruction.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

*Dirk Tasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the study on factorisable joint shift (FJS) to cases involving general label spaces, exploring its implications for classification and regression models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate distribution shifts like FJS and generalized label shift (GLS) beyond categorical label spaces to general label spaces.

Method: A framework is developed for analyzing distribution shift in general label spaces, including generalizing previous findings on FJS and extending the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

Result: Generalized results for FJS in general label spaces are presented alongside an extended EM algorithm compatible with these spaces.

Conclusion: The study broadens the understanding of distribution shifts, allowing analysis in the broader context of general label spaces, aiding classification and regression models.

Abstract: Factorizable joint shift (FJS) was proposed as a type of distribution shift (or dataset shift) that comprises both covariate and label shift. Recently, it has been observed that FJS actually arises from consecutive label and covariate (or vice versa) shifts. Research into FJS so far has been confined to the case of categorical label spaces. We propose a framework for analysing distribution shift in the case of general label spaces, thus covering both classification and regression models. Based on the framework, we generalise existing results on FJS to general label spaces and propose a related extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for class prior probabilities. We also take a fresh look at generalized label shift (GLS) in the case of general label spaces.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology to convert streams of risk scores into review queues while adhering to intake constraints, using an adaptive kernel density estimation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and adaptive methods to convert risk scores into actionable queues under explicit capacity constraints.

Method: The proposed method fits an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transforms it into a tail-mass curve, and determines cutoffs by identifying stable density valleys across bandwidths.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive adherence to intake capacity while reducing fluctuations in thresholds, and operates efficiently in real time.

Conclusion: The label-free, multi-queue supporting approach operates effectively in real-time scenarios, saving memory and computational cost while maintaining performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of converting a stream of risk scores into one or more review queues under explicit intake constraints[cite: 6]. Instead of top-$K$ or manually tuned cutoffs, we fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform the density into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and ``snap'' the resulting cut to a persistent density valley detected across bandwidths[cite: 7]. The procedure is label-free, supports multi-queue routing, and operates in real time with sliding windows or exponential forgetting[cite: 8]. On synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams, the method achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter[cite: 9]. Updates cost $O(G)$ per event with constant memory per activity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient computational approaches for complex problems and investigate the impact of device variability in p-bit systems supported by emerging technologies.

Method: The authors created a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework incorporating key variability factors (timing, intensity, offset) to reflect real-world device behavior.

Result: The approach achieved a 100x speedup over CPU methods in solving the MAX-CUT benchmark problems with large sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes.

Conclusion: Device variability in MTJs can enhance algorithm performance, and the introduced framework serves as a scalable tool for advancing probabilistic computing research spanning optimization applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -- timing, intensity, and offset -- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

*Mrigank Dhingra,Omer San*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecasting model addressing long-term challenges in chaotic dynamical systems by reducing error amplification and improving statistical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues of rapid error amplification and distribution shifts that significantly degrade long-term forecasts of chaotic systems.

Method: MSR-HINE employs a multiscale hierarchical architecture combining coarse-to-fine recurrent states, multiscale latent injections, gated fusion, and hidden-state corrections to enhance forecast accuracy.

Result: MSR-HINE significantly outperforms traditional models, with reduced RMSE and extended prediction horizons across two benchmarks: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz-96.

Conclusion: The proposed MSR-HINE method provides a robust solution for long-horizon forecasting in chaotic systems by effectively addressing error accumulation and variability.

Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unifying framework for analyzing and understanding machine learning approaches to solving PDEs, focusing on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a unified perspective in physics-aware data-driven methods for solving PDEs, which limits their integration and application in scientific workflows.

Method: The authors propose a design space with three dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated, and how computational load is amortized to organize and analyze existing learning-based approaches for PDEs.

Result: The analysis reveals key structural properties of PINNs and NOs, emphasizing how challenges in the field arise from these dimensions. It provides insights into developing reliable machine learning-based solvers for PDEs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a structured, unified framework can significantly advance the development of learning-based PDE solvers and promote the synthesis of physics and data for scientific modeling.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.

*Giulio Rossolini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the validity of adversarial attacks as indicators of robustness to random noise and proposes a probabilistic metric to study noisy risk relative to adversarial and random perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the ongoing debate about whether adversarial attacks effectively evaluate model robustness to random perturbations or merely represent extreme worst-case scenarios.

Method: A probabilistic metric is introduced to quantify noisy risk with directionally biased perturbations via a concentration factor. Additionally, a novel attack strategy aiming for statistical alignment with random noise is proposed.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 highlight scenarios where adversarial attacks correlate well with noisy risk evaluations, as well as cases where they diverge.

Conclusion: The findings clarify the contexts where adversarial attacks are reliable for safety assessments and offer guidance on their appropriate application in robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.

### [201] [On the Runway Cascade of Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14522)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses a misalignment issue in decoder-only transformers caused by indirect paths ('runways') and proposes 'runway-aware rewiring', a mechanism to improve attention by summarizing runway contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are observed failures in causal transformers due to misalignment between direct path attention and indirect runway paths, leading to redundancies and irrelevant information propagation.

Method: The authors introduce runway-aware rewiring, which adjusts attention patterns using runway context summaries without adding parameters, seamlessly integrating it into the standard attention mechanism.

Result: The rewired transformer shows consistent improvements in language modeling and significant gains in information retrieval and extrapolation tasks.

Conclusion: Runway-aware rewiring enhances causal transformer efficiency by mitigating misalignment issues between information propagation modes, improving performance across tasks.

Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

### [202] [Search over Self-Edit Strategies for LLM Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14532)
*Alistair Cheong,Haolin Cong,Tyler Yang,Dustin Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates a novel approach for LLM self-improvement by letting the model decide how to update its weights in a controlled scenario, achieving results close to human-designed baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in LLM-based systems that often rely on rigid, hand-specified update strategies, making continuous progress difficult.

Method: A framework was developed where LLMs choose their own training data and hyperparameters for self-supervised updates, using self-generated templates and testing whether conditioning on an archive improves performance.

Result: When tested on SQuAD, the no-archive variant achieved comparable results to a weaker baseline, while the archive variant outperformed a mid-level baseline and came close to the strongest human-designed baseline.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in self-improvement, explicit novelty pressures may be necessary to exceed the performance of optimized human designs, as naive methods can limit progress.

Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

TL;DR: HyNeA introduces a novel approach for evaluating deep learning systems by using a controllable diffusion-based generative testing method that produces realistic failure cases efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability evaluation of deep learning systems in real-world scenarios is challenging, and traditional methods fail to produce realistic adversarial failures. Alternative generative testing methods are limited by datasets or computational constraints.

Method: HyNeA uses hypernetworks for dataset-free controllability over the generation process in diffusion models. It introduces a unique training strategy for instance-level tuning to generate targeted failure-inducing cases without requiring labeled failure data.

Result: HyNeA achieves improved controllability, test diversity, and extends its functionality to settings without failure-labeled data at substantially reduced computational costs compared to other generative methods.

Conclusion: HyNeA enhances the evaluation of deep learning systems by addressing limitations of traditional and generative methods, providing efficient and diverse realistic failure case generation.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QMC, a quantization method with memory co-design for deploying small language models efficiently on edge platforms, overcoming memory, latency, and energy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory hierarchies are not efficient for small language models on edge platforms due to challenges like memory limitations, latency issues, and device noise, necessitating innovative hybrid memory architectures for LLM inference.

Method: QMC separates inlier and outlier weights, storing inliers in compact ReRAM for efficiency and outliers in precise MRAM, avoiding degradation from device noise using a retraining-free quantization approach.

Result: QMC achieves state-of-the-art performance in compression and efficiency on edge AI platforms, reducing memory usage, data transfers, energy, and latency significantly compared to FP16.

Conclusion: QMC is presented as an effective, scalable, and deployment-ready solution for efficient on-device inference of small language models, addressing critical performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stratified framework to automate MITRE ATT&CK text tagging using AI/ML, achieving superior accuracy in multi-label hierarchical classification models compared to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate the labor-intensive task of tagging cyber-threat intelligence reports using MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Method: A stratified task space is utilized to design multi-label hierarchical classification models, relying on classical machine learning methods instead of LLMs.

Result: The models achieved 94% accuracy at the tactic level and 82% at the technique level, outperforming GPT-4o's accuracy rates.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a reliable, simple AI/ML solution with shareable tools for efficient MITRE ATT&CK text tagging that surpasses complex methods, providing valuable contributions to cybersecurity research.

Abstract: MITRE ATT&CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Transformer-based framework for forecasting daily attendance at large events like Expo 2025 Osaka using reservation dynamics instead of dependent multi-source external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and reliability in attendance forecasting for large-scale international events when historical data or multi-source external data are insufficient.

Method: A Transformer-based framework is proposed, using reservation dynamics (ticket bookings and updates) as a proxy for attendance intentions, implicitly capturing external influences and avoiding complex multi-source integration.

Result: The model performs well under single-channel and two-channel settings, with particularly improved accuracy in short- and medium-term forecasting when East and West gates are separately modeled.

Conclusion: Reservation dynamics are a practical and effective foundation for attendance forecasting, offering both reliability and informativeness, especially when external data sources are limited or unavailable.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

Motivation: To enhance the interpretability of machine learning models by providing counterfactual explanations that help in understanding and improving model predictions, particularly in health-related applications.

Method: The paper assessed counterfactual explanations generated by various LLMs, both pretrained and fine-tuned, using the AI-READI dataset. The evaluation focused on intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, specifically LLaMA-3.1-8B, were tested under data scarcity conditions.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs produced highly plausible, valid counterfactual explanations with actionable insights. They significantly boosted classifier performance by 20% in F1 recovery under label-scarcity scenarios, outperformed optimization-based baselines, and demonstrated adaptability in clinical contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs show great promise in creating clinically actionable counterfactuals, improving interpretability, and enhancing model training through data augmentation. This work highlights their role in sensor-based digital health applications for robust and predictive modeling.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.
  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

*Xiao Hu,Hong Xie,Tao Tan,Defu Lian,Jianyu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the optimization of reinforcement fine-tuning for LLMs, highlighting overlooked design impacts using a novel bottom-up experimental pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistency in claims regarding reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs and the lack of understanding about the role and bottlenecks of optimizing choices.

Method: A bottom-up experimental pipeline starting with a minimalist configuration, progressively adding complexity to isolate and examine optimizing choices.

Result: Experimental results using three LLMs and two reasoning datasets revealed critical insights on optimization choices and resolved ambiguities in the research field.

Conclusion: The study provides a clearer comprehension of the optimization choices, offering actionable insights for the future shaping of reinforcement fine-tuning in LLMs.

Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

*Jingru Li,Yibo Fan,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizes the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing orthogonal momentum updates, enhancing computational efficiency and validation loss performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity of LLM pretraining and improve optimizer efficiency for better and faster convergence.

Method: The paper introduces Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which use variance-adaptive momentum normalization with orthogonal updates for pretraining LLMs.

Result: Muon-NSR and Muon-VS consistently outperform AdamW and existing Muon methods by reducing the required iterations for target validation loss, particularly achieving a 1.36× improvement in the LLaMA-1.2B model.

Conclusion: Muon-NSR and Muon-VS are effective alternatives to traditional optimizers, accelerating LLM pretraining and achieving better accuracy with reduced computational efforts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

*Yvonne Yang,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses heterogeneous graph neural networks on a massive-scale graph for credit default prediction, finding limited standalone GNN benefits but improved hybrid ensemble performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better capture cross-entity dependencies in multi-table financial histories for enhanced credit default prediction.

Method: Constructs a massive heterogeneous graph integrating borrower attributes and transaction-level data, evaluates GNN models, and combines GNN-derived embeddings with tabular models.

Result: Standalone GNNs show limited improvement over gradient-boosted trees, but hybrid ensembles achieve superior results with better ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining tabular models with graph embeddings are promising for credit default prediction. Contrastive pretraining improves stability but has limited downstream impact.

Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

### [212] [Beyond Error-Based Optimization: Experience-Driven Symbolic Regression with Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14693)
*Jianwen Sun,Xinrui Li,Fuqing Li,Xiaoxuan Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EGRL-SR, a framework for symbolic regression using goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, which outperforms existing methods in recovery rate, robustness, and handling complex expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with search ambiguity caused by candidate expressions having similar error values but different structures, limiting convergence to the true function.

Method: EGRL-SR uses goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, hindsight experience replay, binary reward functions focusing on structural patterns, and a heuristic exploration strategy to improve the search process.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that EGRL-SR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery rate, robustness, and ability to recover complex expressions efficiently.

Conclusion: EGRL-SR proves to be a robust and effective technique for symbolic regression, addressing challenges in error-driven search by emphasizing structural patterns and leveraging reinforcement learning strategies.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to automatically identify compact and interpretable mathematical expressions that model the functional relationship between input and output variables. Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning (MGU) framework, addressing challenges in removing sensitive or harmful graph data from GNNs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing Graph Unlearning (GU) methods, such as impractical assessments, ineffectiveness on challenging tasks, and misaligned evaluations.

Method: Developed MGU, leveraging GNN memorization to accurately evaluate difficulty, adaptively adjust unlearning strategies, and provide practical evaluation protocols.

Result: Extensive evaluation on ten real-world graphs shows that MGU surpasses state-of-the-art methods in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: MGU provides a clear improvement in graph unlearning by tackling limitations of current methods and offering a comprehensive framework for practical and effective unlearning.

Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and unpredictability of training LRMs on hard problems or using weak foundation models, especially in scenarios where current scaling strategies are insufficient.

Method: CoScale-RL is introduced as a scaling strategy that scales solutions by collecting multiple solutions per problem instead of just enlarging datasets, scales rollout computation to stabilize reinforcement learning, and uses a model merge technique called Re-distillation for sustained computational efficiency.

Result: The method achieved a significant improvement in efficiency, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.76× on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CoScale-RL method enhances the reasoning ability and efficiency of LRMs, providing a new pathway for improving their performance without relying on large supervised fine-tuning datasets.

Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

*Tianchi Chen,Jan Bima,Sean L. Wu,Otto Ritter,Bingjia Yang,Xiang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model-based RL framework, IBMDP, designed to efficiently sequence experiments in drug discovery under extreme uncertainty, without requiring explicit simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of planning sequences of experimental assays in environments like drug discovery, where uncertainties are high, explicit simulators are unavailable, and resource constraints are strict.

Method: The introduced IBMDP framework leverages nonparametric Bayesian belief models for implicit transition dynamics, updates these beliefs as evidence accumulates, and uses ensemble Monte Carlo Tree Search for planning stable and resource-efficient policies.

Result: IBMDP achieved significant resource savings, up to 92%, in CNS drug discovery tasks compared to heuristics, while producing confident decisions. Additionally, it demonstrated strong alignment with optimal policies in a synthetic benchmark environment.

Conclusion: IBMDP provides a robust approach for sequential experimental design in highly uncertain, data-rich settings lacking explicit simulators, outperforming alternative methods in efficiency and alignment with optimal policies.

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

*Bizu Feng,Zhimu Yang,Shaode Yu,Zixin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSX is a novel hybrid framework combining message flows and cooperative game techniques to explain GNN predictions more effectively and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and explaining the predictions of Graph Neural Networks is challenging due to limitations in existing methods, such as computational inefficiency or lack of structural insights.

Method: FSX uses flow-sensitivity analysis during forward passes to identify critical message flows and combines this with a flow-aware cooperative game to fairly evaluate node contributions in subgraphs.

Result: FSX outperforms existing methods in explanation fidelity, reduces runtime, and provides deep insights into the structural logic of GNN predictions.

Conclusion: FSX successfully bridges the gap by delivering efficient and informative explanations for GNN predictions, balancing computational cost and model reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RefProtoFL is a Federated Learning (FL) framework enhancing prototype-based methods with improved representation consistency and communication efficiency through ERPA and APUD techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication bandwidth challenges and data heterogeneity constraints in edge environments for Federated Learning applications.

Method: RefProtoFL uses External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) and Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD). ERPA aligns representations using a public dataset and external prototypes, while APUD employs Top-K sparsification and focuses on sharing the most significant adapter updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RefProtoFL achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing prototype-based FL methods.

Conclusion: RefProtoFL advances communication-efficient, robust prototype-based FL, particularly under severe communication constraints and client data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

*Injin Kong,Hyoungjoon Lee,Yohan Jo*

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how post-training Autoregressive Models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) alters internal computations to enable global reasoning beyond sequential generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether post-trained MDMs genuinely acquire bidirectional reasoning or simply repurpose autoregressive methods.

Method: Conduct a comparative circuit analysis between ARMs and post-trained MDMs, examining task-specific algorithmic transformations.

Result: Reveals a mechanism shift: MDMs retain autoregressive circuitry for local causal tasks but rewire for global planning with distributed processing.

Conclusion: Diffusion post-training fundamentally reorganizes models to support non-sequential global planning, allowing new computational capabilities beyond sequential autoregressive reasoning.

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

*Harold Kiossou,Pierre Schaus,Siegfried Nijssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved algorithm for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features, addressing challenges with computational time and anytime performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features struggle with computational efficiency and poor anytime behavior, prompting the need for a more practical solution.

Method: The authors utilize a limited discrepancy search approach to distribute computational efforts evenly across the decision tree, enhancing anytime performance while ensuring completeness.

Result: Experimental results indicate the proposed method outperforms previous algorithms in terms of anytime performance, offering high-quality decision trees at any interruption time.

Conclusion: The new algorithm improves decision tree construction for continuous features, achieving better practical applicability and superior performance even when computational processes are interrupted early.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MoE models outperform dense networks beyond just parameter scaling, focusing on their robustness and computational advantages.

Method: The study involves theoretical analysis on the robustness of MoEs under feature noise and empirical validation using synthetic data and language tasks.

Result: MoEs achieve lower generalization error, improved robustness to noise and perturbations, and faster convergence speeds compared to dense estimators.

Conclusion: Sparse modular computation in MoEs provides consistent robustness and efficiency gains, offering advantages in handling noisy inputs and achieving faster learning.

Abstract: Despite their practical success, it remains unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense networks beyond sheer parameter scaling. We study an iso-parameter regime where inputs exhibit latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise, a proxy for noisy internal activations. We show that sparse expert activation acts as a noise filter: compared to a dense estimator, MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed. Empirical results on synthetic data and real-world language tasks corroborate the theoretical insights, demonstrating consistent robustness and efficiency gains from sparse modular computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for automated generation of reflection questions using two large language model agents working interactively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection questions are crucial in education but are challenging and time-intensive for teachers to design effectively.

Method: The framework involves two specialized agents—a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator—engaging in Socratic dialogue to iteratively refine reflection questions based on specified educational contexts.

Result: Dynamic stopping and context inclusion improve question quality, and the two-agent approach consistently outperforms a one-shot baseline with better clarity, relevance, and depth.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework offers a promising method to generate high-quality reflection questions, improving over fixed iteration or single-step designs.

Abstract: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers. This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on supervised learning with distributional inputs using kernel-based methods, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and provides theoretical advancements including consistency, learning rates, and a new feature space for Gaussian kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses a gap in understanding supervised learning with distributional inputs, especially when these distributions can only be accessed via samples during the learning phase in applications like medical screening or causal learning.

Method: The method uses kernel mean embeddings to map distributions into a Hilbert space and then applies kernel-based approaches (e.g., SVMs with hinge loss) to enable classification. Theoretical analysis includes oracle inequalities and noise assumptions.

Result: The study contributes new insights into consistency and learning rates for SVMs with Gaussian kernels and establishes a novel feature space for Gaussian kernels.

Conclusion: The findings advance the theoretical underpinnings of kernel-based methods for handling distributional inputs, enhancing their potential in practical applications like classification tasks.

Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

*Baojun Che,Yifan Chen,Daniel Zhengyu Huang,Xinying Mao,Weijie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed a stable and efficient framework for black-box variational inference (BBVI) using Gaussian mixture distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address instability and inefficiency in BBVI frameworks that use Gaussian mixture families.

Method: The approach integrates affine-invariant preconditioning, exponential integrators for covariance positivity, and adaptive time stepping for stability.

Result: It shows exponential convergence for Gaussian posteriors, proves convergence with Monte Carlo estimation, and demonstrates improved performance for complex distributions in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances stability and efficiency in BBVI with Gaussian mixtures, supporting broader applications in Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM) are introduced to enhance strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency, improved forecasting, and reduced violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while ensuring doctrinal consistency in strategic reasoning frameworks.

Method: The sdLM framework integrates multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and doctrine-consistency layers, evaluated through expert scoring, doctrine consistency, and geopolitical forecasting.

Result: sdLM outperforms general-purpose LLMs in strategic quality and calibration, competes with human experts on long-horizon judgments, with additional insights from ablations and performance trends.

Conclusion: sdLM is a viable and competitive solution for strategic reasoning, offering operational-enhanced performance and doctrinal reliability over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized workflow for improving the inference efficiency of reasoning models through a systematic study of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance reasoning models' inference efficiency without significant accuracy drops when utilizing low-bit settings for tasks like coding and mathematics.

Method: The study investigates post-training quantization (PTQ) as a precursor to QAT and explores integrating knowledge distillation, adapting reinforcement learning, and aligning training domains to optimize quantized reasoning models.

Result: The Reasoning-QAT workflow surpasses state-of-the-art PTQ methods, demonstrating significant performance improvements (e.g., 44.53% over GPTQ on MATH-500 using Qwen3-0.6B) and effective recovery in low-bit regimes.

Conclusion: Quantization-Aware Training, when paired with optimized techniques and insights from the study, offers a robust path toward efficient and high-performing quantized reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalized, deep learning-based blood glucose prediction model using patient-specific data, enhancing diabetes management through wearable health technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Type 1 Diabetes management by enhancing the accuracy and responsiveness of blood glucose predictions, addressing the limitations in traditional generalized models, and utilizing wearable technology and mobile health platforms.

Method: The paper employs deep learning techniques for personalized blood glucose prediction, comparing Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy, and a multimodal patient-specific approach versus CGM-only methods.

Result: Results indicate personalized models significantly improve adverse event prediction, outperform traditional methods, and are effective even with limited patient-specific training data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of adaptive and personalized models in wearable and mobile health applications, paving the way for more precise and effective diabetes care solutions.

Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

*Hang Zhao,Hongru Li,Dongfang Xu,Shenghui Song,Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for communication-efficient and robust multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) over wireless links, reducing communication costs and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high communication overhead and limited robustness in multi-modal edge inference over bandwidth-limited wireless links.

Method: The framework is divided into three stages: Stage I: Local multi-modal self-supervised learning to reduce communication; Stage II: Distributed fine-tuning with evidential fusion for robust feature aggregation; Stage III: Uncertainty-guided feedback for optimizing communication-accuracy tradeoff.

Result: The proposed framework achieves higher accuracy with fewer training communications and remains robust to degraded modalities and channel variations in RGB-depth indoor scene classification.

Conclusion: The method outperforms existing baselines by being both communication-efficient and robust, making it suitable for distributed edge intelligence.

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

*Han Li,Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper targets the challenge of detecting multimodal rumors on social media by introducing a novel model integrating external evidence, forgery detection, and advanced fusion strategies, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the challenges of multimodal rumor detection on social media, as current methods struggle with effective feature extraction, noise, inflexible fusion, and lack of external factual evidence for verification.

Method: A multimodal detection model combining ResNet34 for visual encoding, BERT for text encoding, forgery detection via Fourier features, image description generation via BLIP, contrastive learning modules for semantic mismatches, and a gated adaptive fusion mechanism.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated superior performance over existing methods in terms of macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score on Weibo and Twitter datasets.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves upon mainstream multimodal rumor detection methods by addressing limitations in traditional techniques, ensuring robust detection of semantic mismatches and forged contents.

Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

*Harry Mead,Bruno Lacerda,Jakob Foerster,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEGen and MNA to improve unsupervised environment design (UED) in reinforcement learning, solving challenges of credit assignment and environment scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of automatically generating effective training curricula for RL agents and improve generalisation and zero-shot performance.

Method: The authors propose DEGen for denser level generator rewards to simplify credit assignment and improve scalability, and a new regret approximation metric, MNA, to optimise and identify challenging levels more effectively.

Result: MNA surpasses existing regret approximations, and DEGen combined with it consistently beats current methods, particularly in larger environments.

Conclusion: The approaches presented, DEGen and MNA, significantly enhance UED's effectiveness and scalability, offering better curricula and agent performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

*Mingyue Cheng,Xiaoyu Tao,Huajian Zhang,Qi Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructTime introduces a novel framework that treats time series classification as a multimodal generative task by utilizing language models tuned for cross-modal learning. InstructTime++ enhances this by extracting and translating implicit features for better integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series classification methods face challenges in incorporating contextual features and understanding semantic class relationships due to their discriminative approach. This research aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed framework transforms the classification problem into a multimodal generative task, converting continuous sequences into discrete tokens and using textual inputs and outputs. It further incorporates implicit feature modeling using statistical tools and vision-language methods for stronger representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that InstructTime++ outperforms traditional methods in time series classification.

Conclusion: InstructTime++ addresses the weaknesses of existing methods by leveraging deep multimodal and implicit feature integration, demonstrating its superior capability in time series classification tasks.

Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FG-Trac is a framework providing sample-level traceability in machine learning pipelines through cryptographic methods without altering system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to ensure verifiable, sample-level transparency and trackability in complex ML pipelines, as existing mechanisms only operate at the model-level without auditing individual data usage.

Method: FG-Trac employs cryptographic commitments and lifecycle event monitoring to establish sample-level traceability through preprocessing and training stages, without modifying existing ML model architecture.

Result: The framework manages to create auditable data usage histories with low computational overhead, demonstrated through tests on CNN and multimodal graph pipelines where predictive performance remained unaffected.

Conclusion: FG-Trac enables tamper-proof, fine-grained traceability in ML systems without changing their structure or performance, addressing a critical gap in sample-level data auditing.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a regression-based approach to address the challenge of sparse and noisy data in basketball lineup performance analysis, showing improved predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the problem of evaluating the performance of basketball lineups despite challenges like sparse data and noisy statistics due to frequent lineup changes and limited possessions.

Method: The method involves a regression-based approach (L-RAPM) that takes into account the strength of opposing players and lineup information to improve predictive analysis.

Result: The proposed L-RAPM approach demonstrated improved predictive power over the current baseline, especially for lineups with smaller sample sizes.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel and effective method for improving the accuracy of lineup performance predictions, significantly benefitting sports analytics.

Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning in active flow control lacks standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistent progress assessment due to heterogeneous setups and protocols.

Method: FluidGym is built on PyTorch using the PICT solver, eliminating the need for external CFD software. It provides fully differentiable environments and standardized evaluation protocols.

Result: Baseline experiments with PPO and SAC are presented, and all necessary resources, including environments, datasets, and models, are made publicly available.

Conclusion: FluidGym offers a scalable and standardized foundation for future learning-based flow control research, facilitating systematic evaluation and comparison.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in image classification (CIFAR10), comparing predictive performance and expert utilization across dense and sparse models. MoE slightly outperforms dense models but does not realize modern hardware speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the behavior of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in an image classification domain, focusing on performance, utilization, and generalization under comparable capacities.

Method: The researchers compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on CIFAR10, analyzing accuracy, expert utilization, sharpness metrics (Hessian-based), and loss surface perturbations. They also assess inference efficiency on modern hardware.

Result: MoE variants achieved slightly better validation accuracy while avoiding expert collapse. SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness metrics, but all models generalized comparably. Conditional routing does not improve inference efficiency on modern hardware.

Conclusion: MoE models provide minor accuracy improvements and balanced expert utilization in image classification but fail to offer inference efficiency on modern hardware, indicating unsolved challenges in practical applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses solving the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (EVRPTW) using a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning framework (CB-DRL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome stability and generalization challenges when applying deep reinforcement learning models to EVRPTW, which involves optimizing routing while minimizing fleet size, travel distance, battery use, and meeting customer time constraints.

Method: A CB-DRL method is used, involving a structured three-phase curriculum (distance/fleet optimization, battery management, full EVRPTW) alongside a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm and a graph attention encoder that captures depots, customers, and charging stations.

Result: The trained model generalizes well to unseen instances (N=5 to N=100 customers), outperforming standard DRL baselines in medium-scale problems while maintaining high feasibility and solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum-guided DRL framework bridges the gap between neural optimization speed and the reliability needed for solving complex logistical problems like EVRPTW.

Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve quantization-aware training (QAT) in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which efficiently optimizes quantized aggregations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve the performance and efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in resource-limited environments. Quantization-aware training (QAT) is crucial for enabling efficient low-bit GNNs, and prompt learning offers a potential avenue for further optimization.

Method: The paper proposes Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), a novel input-dependent prompting method that introduces lightweight prompts into aggregated graph features. This approach tailors and optimizes the quantization process of GNNs while minimizing computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 state-of-the-art QAT frameworks and 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently achieves enhanced performance for low-bit quantized GNNs with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: LoRAP effectively improves the performance of quantization-aware training in GNNs by optimizing the aggregation process for quantized features. This demonstrates its potential for efficient graph data processing in constrained computational environments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: Existing RL research focuses mainly on memory retention, neglecting the equally important need for agents to rewrite or adapt outdated information under changing environments.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark testing memory rewriting in partial observability conditions, and evaluate recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures.

Result: Classic recurrent models showed superior adaptability and robustness in memory rewriting tasks, while structured memories and transformer-based agents faced significant limitations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of balanced memory mechanisms in RL, offering benchmarks and insights to guide the development of agents with trainable forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

### [239] [Field-Space Autoencoder for Scalable Climate Emulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15102)
*Johannes Meuer,Maximilian Witte,Étiénne Plésiat,Thomas Ludwig,Christopher Kadow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Field-Space Autoencoder, a spherical compression model for climate emulation that mitigates computational challenges and geometric distortions in kilometer-scale Earth system models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are critical for understanding climate changes at local scales, but are hindered by high computational costs and massive data outputs, limiting applications like risk assessments.

Method: The Field-Space Autoencoder employs a novel Field-Space Attention mechanism to compress spherical climate data preserving physical structures, and integrates a generative diffusion model for combining low-resolution and high-resolution datasets.

Result: The proposed framework efficiently emulates climate data with reduced computational requirements, achieving better preservation of physical structures and enabling zero-shot super-resolution between different resolution datasets.

Conclusion: Field-Space Autoencoder and its generative diffusion model bridge the gap between extensive low-resolution ensemble statistics and limited high-resolution physical details, enhancing scalability and utility in climate modeling.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

### [240] [Auditing Language Model Unlearning via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111)
*Anmol Goel,Alan Ritter,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study identifies that current machine unlearning methods still allow forgotten data to be decodable from model representations and proposes an audit method using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning strategies in language models fail to fully erase information about forgotten data, posing privacy risks.

Method: The authors use Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to systematically analyze and decompose the mutual information in model representations to assess unlearning. They propose a representation-based risk score for mitigating sensitive input leakage.

Result: The study finds that residual information about forgotten data persists post-unlearning in models, highlighting a vulnerability to adversarial reconstruction attacks. The proposed PID-based approach helps identify and reduce this risk.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical and actionable framework for auditing and improving machine unlearning in language models, enhancing their privacy and deployment safety.

Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Graph Foundation Model addressing scalability and interpretability limitations in graph learning by externalizing knowledge through a unified dual-modal retrieval module. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address scalability, efficiency, and interpretability challenges in Graph Foundation Models caused by in-memory bottlenecks and parameter-entangled knowledge.

Method: RAG-GFM externalizes graph knowledge using a dual-modal unified retrieval module, semantic/structural stores, a dual-view alignment objective, and in-context augmentation for efficient downstream adaptation.

Result: Experiments on five benchmark datasets show RAG-GFM's superiority over 13 state-of-the-art baselines in cross-domain node and graph classification.

Conclusion: RAG-GFM significantly enhances graph learning scalability, efficiency, and interpretability by offloading and augmenting knowledge, proving its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

### [242] [CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141)
*Tianshi Xu,Yuteng Chen,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLEANER, a method that enhances Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) for parameter-constrained models by directly purifying error-contaminated data, improving performance without external filtering or high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of noisy trajectories and credit assignment issues resulting from execution failures in small parameter-constrained models during exploration.

Method: CLEANER uses a Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism to replace failed actions with self-corrected ones, constructing purified trajectories based on semantic similarity adjustments.

Result: CLEANER demonstrates an average accuracy improvement of 6%, 3%, and 5% on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced training steps.

Conclusion: Trajectory purification via intrinsic self-correction is a scalable and computationally efficient solution for improving agentic RL performance, particularly in parameter-constrained models.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL. Our models and code are available at GitHub

### [243] [Outcome-Based RL Provably Leads Transformers to Reason, but Only With the Right Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15158)
*Yuval Ran-Milo,Yotam Alexander,Shahar Mendel,Nadav Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how sparse rewards in reinforcement learning allow transformers to spontaneously develop chain-of-thought reasoning, using gradient flow analysis on a structured graph traversal task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism by which transformers trained with sparse rewards develop systematic reasoning abilities, particularly chain-of-thought, despite being only trained on the final-answer correctness.

Method: The authors analyze gradient flow dynamics in single-layer transformers trained on a synthetic graph traversal task through theoretical and empirical investigations. They also explore the role of training distribution on task complexity in facilitating reasoning emergence.

Result: The study proves that when trained on tasks with sufficient simpler examples, transformers learn structured reasoning strategies that generalize, while insufficient simpler examples render learning infeasible. The results are validated on both synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Gradient-based learning can lead transformers to discover interpretable iterative reasoning strategies if the training data distribution emphasizes simple instances. These findings provide insight into how chain-of-thought reasoning emerges in transformers trained via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

### [244] [ZENITH: Automated Gradient Norm Informed Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15212)
*Dhrubo Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZENITH is a new optimizer for deep learning that automatically adapts the learning rate, achieving superior performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing adaptive optimizers in terms of computational overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices.

Method: ZENITH leverages the gradient norm's temporal evolution to adapt the learning rate with zero additional computational and memory overhead.

Result: ZENITH outperformed baseline optimizers in classification, object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: ZENITH is an efficient optimizer that improves model accuracy, reduces training time, and is compatible with regularization techniques.

Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

*Garrett G. Wen,Buxin Su,Natalie Collina,Zhun Deng,Weijie Su*

TL;DR: The paper proposes an author-assisted mechanism using the Isotonic Mechanism to improve the process of selecting best paper awards at AI conferences by incentivizing truthful self-assessment and improving award quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of maintaining the quality and consistency of peer review and best paper award selection in AI conferences, which have grown in submission volume and debates around fairness.

Method: The authors use the Isotonic Mechanism to incorporate self-assessed rankings by authors into the score adjustment process, ensuring truthful reporting under certain utility functions. They verify assumptions using publicly available review data and extend the mechanism for overlapping authorship.

Result: The mechanism improves the quality of best paper selections by incentivizing truthful author rankings and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulation results.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical and effective way to enhance the best paper award selection process, addressing growing concerns in large-scale peer reviewed conferences.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MolecularIQ, a benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) over molecular graphs for properties and tasks in chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for chemistry LLMs often assess general knowledge using biased methods. The authors seek a robust and focused system to evaluate LLMs' reasoning over molecular graphs objectively and in fine detail.

Method: The authors developed MolecularIQ, a benchmark consisting of symbolically verifiable tasks. This benchmark thoroughly examines and localizes LLM failures in reasoning about molecular structures.

Result: MolecularIQ identifies capability patterns in LLMs, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses over specific tasks and molecular structures.

Conclusion: MolecularIQ offers a way to evaluate and improve chemistry LLMs by revealing their limitations and guiding their development toward better molecular reasoning.

Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.

Motivation: To provide a comprehensive and formal tool for specifying various parallel implementations of ACO algorithms.

Method: Developing PA^2CO, defining its formal structure, and applying it to represent fine-grained and coarse-grained parallel schemes for ACO.

Conclusion: PA^2CO is an effective formalism for detailing and differentiating parallelized ACO strategies, offering insights for both fine-grained and coarse-grained parallel execution.

Abstract: We present a process algebra capable of specifying parallelized Ant Colony Optimization algorithms in full detail: PA$^2$CO. After explaining the basis of three different ACO algorithms (Ant System, MAX-MIN Ant System, and Ant Colony System), we formally define PA$^2$CO and use it for representing several types of implementations with different parallel schemes. In particular fine-grained and coarse-grained specifications, each one taking advantage of parallel executions at different levels of system granularity, are formalized.

*Amaras Nazarians,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: GEGO is a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that integrates Golden Eagle Optimization with genetic operators, enhancing performance in hyperparameter optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenge of hyperparameter tuning in neural networks, especially in high-dimensional, nonconvex search spaces.

Method: GEGO combines the population movement of GEO with genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) directly incorporated into the iterative process, enhancing population diversity and reducing premature convergence.

Result: GEGO outperforms its components and classical metaheuristics on standard benchmark functions and achieves improved accuracy and convergence stats in hyperparameter tuning for MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: This hybrid algorithm offers a robust exploration-exploitation balance, making it apt for computationally constrained hyperparameter optimization tasks.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a critical yet computationally expensive step in training neural networks, particularly when the search space is high dimensional and nonconvex. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are often used for this purpose due to their derivative free nature and robustness against local optima. In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.
  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents POEM, an enhancement to the PPO algorithm that uses evolutionary mutations for better exploration, addressing premature convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO suffers from limited exploration leading to premature convergence, which restricts its effectiveness in reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: Introduced POEM, which tracks the KL divergence to identify stagnation in policy updates and triggers adaptive evolutionary mutations to enhance exploration.

Result: Experimental evaluation across four OpenAI Gym tasks revealed POEM significantly outperformed PPO in three tasks (BipedalWalker, CarRacing, MountainCar), with no significant improvement in LunarLander.

Conclusion: Integrating evolutionary algorithms into policy gradient methods, as demonstrated by POEM, can successfully improve exploration and balance the tradeoff in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency, but it often suffers from premature convergence due to limited exploration. In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p<0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778). Our results highlight the potential of integrating evolutionary principles into policy gradient methods to overcome exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

TL;DR: SyncPerf is a GPU modeling framework combining analytical and machine learning methods to enhance performance prediction accuracy for modern inference workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and generalizable GPU performance modeling rose due to growing reliance on Transformer-based language models and high-performance hardware.

Method: The framework integrates analytical models for kernel demand assessment with machine learning models to capture complex GPU interactions, enabling precise predictions.

Result: SyncPerf achieves 6.1% kernel-level error and 8.5% prediction error for end-to-end inference, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly. It also aids kernel optimization with measurable speedups.

Conclusion: SyncPerf offers superior prediction accuracy and practical optimization capabilities for GPU workloads, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Transformer-based large language models has dramatically increased the need for high-performance GPUs. As a result, there is growing demand for fast, accurate, and widely generalizable GPU performance models to support next-generation hardware selection and system-level exploration. However, current data-driven methods are limited, exhibiting poor generalization across hardware and inadequate modeling of complex production-level kernels common in modern inference stacks. To address these issues, we present SyncPerf, a unified GPU modeling framework. This approach first employs an analytical model to quantify a given kernel's demands on the GPU's heterogeneous instruction pipelines. These analytical features are then fed into a machine learning (ML) model to capture complex cross-pipeline interactions and resource dependencies, enabling high-fidelity performance prediction. Our evaluation across 11 GPU types from four generations of major architectures on two widely-used serving systems demonstrates that SyncPerf delivers high fidelity and strong generalizability. It achieves accurate predictions, with only 6.1% average error at the kernel level and 8.5% for end-to-end inference -- reducing the error of state-of-the-art methods by 6.7x and 4.4x, respectively. We also demonstrate SynPerf's value "beyond simulation" by utilizing its performance ceiling to diagnose implementation shortcomings and guide the optimization of a production fused MoE Triton kernel, achieving up to 1.7x speedup.

TL;DR: DeGAS is a novel approach enabling differentiable optimization in probabilistic programs with both continuous and discrete components, achieving competitive accuracy without Monte Carlo sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of sampling-based methods (e.g., Monte Carlo) in probabilistic programs, especially in optimization tasks that involve continuous variables.

Method: DeGAS provides a differentiable Gaussian mixture-based semantics for probabilistic programs. It smooths discrete branches and measure-zero predicates while deriving closed-form expressions for probabilities, leveraging automatic differentiation for optimization.

Result: DeGAS demonstrates competitive accuracy and runtime performance compared to variational inference and MCMC, and reliably optimizes problems where sampling methods fail.

Conclusion: DeGAS is an effective, sample-free framework for optimization in probabilistic programming, overcoming pitfalls of traditional sampling-based techniques for certain problems.

Abstract: We present DeGAS, a differentiable Gaussian approximate semantics for loopless probabilistic programs that enables sample-free, gradient-based optimization in models with both continuous and discrete components. DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators. On thirteen benchmark programs, DeGAS achieves accuracy and runtime competitive with variational inference and MCMC. Importantly, it reliably tackles optimization problems where sampling-based baselines fail to converge due to conditioning involving continuous variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical use cases like servers shipping code dynamically via messages, which requires robust integration of contextual modal type theory.

Method: Design a model based on contextual modal type theory with multi-level contexts, develop a type system distinguishing linear and unrestricted resources, and implement a type checker.

Result: Achieved type preservation, sequential computation progress, absence of runtime errors in concurrent environments, and type checker correctness.

Conclusion: The implemented system is both theoretically sound and practically applicable for message-passing systems demanding dynamic code delivery.

Abstract: We propose the integration of staged metaprogramming into a session-typed message passing functional language. We build on a model of contextual modal type theory with multi-level contexts, where contextual values, closing arbitrary terms over a series of variables, may be boxed and transmitted in messages. Once received, one such value may then be unboxed and locally applied before being run. To motivate this integration, we present examples of real-world use cases, for which our system would be suitable, such as servers preparing and shipping code on demand via session typed messages. We present a type system that distinguishes linear (used exactly once) from unrestricted (used an unbounded number of times) resources, and further define a type checker, suitable for a concrete implementation. We show type preservation, a progress result for sequential computations and absence of runtime errors for the concurrent runtime environment, as well as the correctness of the type checker.

Conclusion: RoboBrain 2.5 enhances embodied intelligence by integrating depth-aware reasoning and step-aware temporal estimation for fine-grained tasks.

Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, a next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in UAV-swarm deployment due to dynamic environments, infrastructure constraints, and computational demands, particularly for high-risk scenarios like disaster response.

Conclusion: LLM-powered agentic AI can significantly enhance UAV swarm autonomy and efficiency when combined with edge computing, though challenges remain for deployment in mission-critical applications.

Abstract: The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality. However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited integration of high-fidelity haptic systems in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries due to challenges in accurate force rendering and system safety.

Method: The study developed NIMA, which incorporates nonlinear dynamics into the Impedance Matching Approach (IMA) to model and render tool-tissue interactions more effectively.

Result: NIMA reduces force feedback error by 95% compared to IMA, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.01 N, and eliminates haptic kickback, ensuring user comfort and patient safety.

Conclusion: NIMA significantly enhances force accuracy and responsiveness, advancing haptic systems for robotic-assisted surgeries.

Abstract: Background: The integration of haptic feedback into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) has long been limited by challenges in accurately rendering forces and ensuring system safety. The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic "kickback" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures.

### [256] [UNCLE-Grasp: Uncertainty-Aware Grasping of Leaf-Occluded Strawberries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14492)
*Malak Mansour,Ali Abouzeid,Zezhou Sun,Qinbo Sun,Dezhen Song,Abdalla Swikir*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of robotic strawberry harvesting under partial occlusion using an uncertainty-aware grasping approach that models geometric uncertainties effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harvesting strawberries with robots is challenging when leaves obscure vision, creating uncertainty in grasp planning and execution.

Method: The proposed pipeline employs Monte Carlo dropout for point cloud completion to generate multiple shape hypotheses, evaluates grasp feasibility using force-closure metrics, and applies a lower confidence bound criterion for grasp decisions.

Result: Simulations and physical tests verify that the method improves grasp reliability under occlusion by abstaining from risky attempts and performing robustly when confident, surpassing deterministic strategies.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty modeling enhances robotic grasping reliability in strawberry harvesting, especially under severe occlusion conditions.

Abstract: Robotic strawberry harvesting is challenging under partial occlusion, where leaves induce significant geometric uncertainty and make grasp decisions based on a single deterministic shape estimate unreliable. From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.

### [257] [TacUMI: A Multi-Modal Universal Manipulation Interface for Contact-Rich Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14550)
*Tailai Cheng,Kejia Chen,Lingyun Chen,Liding Zhang,Yue Zhang,Yao Ling,Mahdi Hamad,Zhenshan Bing,Fan Wu,Karan Sharma,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TacUMI introduces a compact multi-modal data collection device and segmentation framework for improving task decomposition in contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and segmenting complex manipulation tasks, especially those involving physical interactions, require efficient multi-modal data and robust event-boundary detection methods.

Method: TacUMI uses an enhanced handheld demonstration device integrated with ViTac sensors, force-torque sensors, and pose trackers to collect synchronized multi-modal data. A segmentation framework based on temporal models detects event boundaries in task demonstrations.

Result: Evaluation on a cable mounting task showed over 90% segmentation accuracy, proving the benefits of multi-modal data integration.

Conclusion: TacUMI provides a foundation for scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in tasks with rich physical interactions.

Abstract: Task decomposition is critical for understanding and learning complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.

It decomposes workflows into execution graphs with reusable components, separating system states from control logic to enable plug-and-play deployment across various robot morphologies. Unlike traditional middleware, it prioritizes efficiency through batched, vectorized data flow, minimizing communication overhead and improving inference latency. This modular, data-oriented approach enables seamless sim-to-real transfer with minimal re-engineering. We demonstrate that UniCon reduces code redundancy when transferring workflows and achieves higher inference efficiency compared to ROS-based systems.

### [259] [Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14622)
*Ling Xiao,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates prompt designs for socially compliant navigation in robots by experimenting with system guidance and motivational framing, revealing variable effects on performance based on prompt and model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding suitable prompt designs for small vision language models (VLMs) used in social robot navigation.

Method: The authors explored prompt designs inspired by cognitive theories, categorizing them into system guidance and motivational framing. Experiments were conducted using two datasets to evaluate performance.

Result: 1) Specific prompt designs (e.g., competition against humans) showed variable performance with non-finetuned and finetuned models. 2) Poor prompt design can hinder performance. 3) System prompts improve action accuracy more effectively than direct finetuning.

Conclusion: Prompt design significantly affects navigation performance. The approach acts as a decision-level constraint, highlighting the importance of tailored prompting alongside model finetuning.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroVLA mimics biological motion, achieving efficient and responsive robotic control with a bio-inspired design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of robotic policies in replicating biological motion and rapid skill acquisition.

Method: Develop a bio-inspired framework (NeuroVLA) incorporating elements akin to the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord for robotics.

Result: NeuroVLA achieves biological motor-like traits, stops robotic arm shaking, conserves energy, and shows quick reflexes.

Conclusion: NeuroVLA demonstrates a breakthrough in robotics by mimicking biological systems with efficient performance and responsiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied intelligence have leveraged massive scaling of data and model parameters to master natural-language command following and multi-task control. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.

### [261] [Landing-Induced Viscoelastic Changes in an Anthropomimetic Foot Joint Structure are Modulated by Foot Structure and Posture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14634)
*Satoru Hashimoto,Yinlai Jiang,Hiroshi Yokoi,Shunta Togo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study developed an anthropomimetic foot structure to replicate human foot mechanics and analyzed how skeletal architecture affects landing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the role of skeletal architecture in landing dynamics, as cadaver studies face limitations in probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses.

Method: The researchers used an anthropomimetic foot joint structure in a vertical drop apparatus and applied a viscoelastic system-identification model to examine post-impact responses.

Result: The multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure displayed a higher damping ratio than simpler designs, and changes in ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension influenced the viscoelastic parameters.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated that arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architectures improve impact attenuation and offer engineering potential for human-like viscoelastic behavior through posture adjustments.

Abstract: Cadaveric studies have provided important insights into the mechanics of the human foot arch and plantar fascia. However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.

*Ping Zhong,Liangbai Liu,Bolei Chen,Tao Wu,Jiazhi Xia,Chaoxu Mu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to improve sample efficiency and spatial generalization in Mobile Manipulation tasks by introducing Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges of low sample efficiency and poor spatial generalization in Mobile Manipulation tasks.

Method: Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) prioritizes critical fragments in long trajectories, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is used for forward planning and dynamics understanding.

Result: Experiments show improved performance over existing Mobile Manipulation policies and successful generalization to new spatial layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances multi-stage skill compositions, improves sample efficiency, and better generalizes Mobile Manipulation tasks to varied spatial configurations.

Abstract: Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework integrating semantic reasoning via a large language model (LLM) and adaptive decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL), achieving improved exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous robotic exploration by combining semantic reasoning at the global level with efficient local decision-making.

Method: FARE adopts a fast-slow thinking paradigm where a large language model (LLM) interprets textual environment descriptions to set global waypoints, while a reinforcement learning (RL) policy handles local control guided by these waypoints. Graph pruning reduces redundancy.

Result: FARE demonstrated significant enhancements in exploration efficiency in challenging simulated environments and successfully deployed on physical hardware in large-scale environments.

Conclusion: The integration of global semantic reasoning with local decision capability allows efficient, coherent, and adaptive robotic exploration in complex unknown spaces.

Abstract: This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\times130m$ building environment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 1.47 mm diameter soft robotic catheter for safer intraluminal procedures by offering sensing, actuation, and therapeutic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of clinical adoption of soft robotic instruments, including insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback, for safe navigation in delicate anatomy.

Method: The researchers developed a modular soft robotic catheter integrated with sensing, actuation, and therapy capabilities, tested in in vivo settings, particularly for ERCP.

Result: The catheter successfully demonstrated semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and navigation within a live porcine model, achieving functionality beyond existing tools.

Conclusion: The study establishes a platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters that prioritizes safety, enhances endoluminal interventions, and has the potential to improve procedural efficiency and clinical adoption.

Abstract: Soft robotic instruments could navigate delicate, tortuous anatomy more safely than rigid tools, but clinical adoption is limited by insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback at the tissue interface. Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tool localization in RMIS is critical for safety and effective task execution, but pose estimation errors due to encoder inaccuracies in cable-driven robots pose significant challenges.

Method: The study proposes a framework combining feature association and hand-eye calibration algorithms to improve key point detection and adapt to varying surgical scenarios without pre-training.

Result: Testing on public video datasets shows the proposed framework significantly reduces tool localization errors, achieving high accuracy and superior time efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The calibration framework effectively enhances tool localization in RMIS, demonstrating robustness, adaptability, and efficiency in diverse surgical conditions.

Abstract: In Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), accurate tool localization is crucial to ensure patient safety and successful task execution. However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.

Conclusion: HumanoidVLM successfully links perception and control, showcasing its potential as an interpretable and adaptive solution for humanoid robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

Motivation: To improve the deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world systems by addressing latency, resource limitations, and privacy issues associated with cloud-based solutions.

Method: The study designs a WebRTC-based pipeline for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot to stream multimodal data to an edge node and compares the performance of specific VLMs (LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) deployed at the edge and in the cloud under real-time conditions.

Result: Edge deployment achieves near-cloud accuracy with a 5% reduction in latency. A compact model optimized for resource-constrained environments delivers sub-second responsiveness and reduces latency by over 50%, albeit with reduced accuracy.

Conclusion: Deploying VLMs at the edge enhances real-time processing capabilities, maintaining high accuracy or significantly improving latency based on model selection. Edge intelligence demonstrates potential for better robotic task support in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable multimodal reasoning for robotic perception and interaction, but their deployment in real-world systems remains constrained by latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks of cloud offloading. Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\%. We further evaluate Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, a compact model optimized for resource-constrained environments, which achieves sub-second responsiveness, cutting latency by more than half but at the cost of accuracy.

Result: TIDAL achieves 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware compared to 2.4 Hz baselines, delivering 2x performance improvement in interception tasks and 4x feedback frequency increase.

Conclusion: TIDAL reduces latency's impact in dynamic environments, enhances feedback frequency, and extends the semantic embedding horizon in Vision-Language-Action systems.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.

Abstract: Reliable human--robot collaboration in emergency scenarios requires autonomous systems that can detect humans, infer navigation goals, and operate safely in dynamic environments. This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11--based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.

*Adip Ranjan Das,Maria Koskinopoulou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces eGRAP, a system for autonomous disassembly of e-waste using dual robotic arms, integrated with vision, dynamic planning, and online adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-waste is accumulating rapidly worldwide, and current recycling rates are insufficient to mitigate the associated environmental and resource challenges. Automating disassembly processes can enhance recycling efficiency.

Method: The proposed system, eGRAP, uses a directed graph framework for dynamic planning and task scheduling. It integrates vision-based identification with dual-arm robotic execution, employing one arm for removal and the other for component handling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate eGRAP successfully disassembles 3.5-inch hard drives with high success rates and efficient cycle times, showcasing its ability to coordinate dual-arm tasks adaptively and consistently.

Conclusion: eGRAP proves to be an effective solution for automated e-waste disassembly, potentially improving recycling processes by enabling rapid and successful breakdown of electronic components.

Abstract: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low. We propose an electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) that integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution for autonomous disassembly. A camera-equipped arm identifies parts and estimates their poses, and a directed graph encodes which parts must be removed first. A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online. Experiments show consistent full disassembly of each HDD, with high success rates and efficient cycle times, illustrating the method's ability to adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time.

*Fumiya Ohnishi,Masaki Takahashi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Window Pure Pursuit (DWPP) to address path-tracking issues in mobile robots, considering velocity and acceleration constraints for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional path-tracking methods like pure pursuit lack consideration for velocity and acceleration constraints, causing tracking inaccuracies and overshoot.

Method: DWPP reformulates the command velocity computation within the velocity space (v-ω plane), ensuring commands respect dynamic constraints by choosing velocity closest to the line ω=κv.

Result: Experimental results show DWPP avoids violating constraints and improves path-tracking accuracy compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: DWPP provides a constraint-aware solution for mobile robot path tracking, leading to enhanced accuracy and performance. The method is available in the Nav2 repository for implementation.

Abstract: Pure pursuit and its variants are widely used for mobile robot path tracking owing to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$ω$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $ω= κv$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods. The proposed method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository and is publicly available (https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2).

*Leon Tolksdorf,Arturo Tejada,Jonas Bauernfeind,Christian Birkner,Nathan van de Wouw*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a general and accurate method for risk estimation in automated driving by integrating collision probability with severity measures, providing computational efficiency beneficial for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated vehicles require an accurate risk assessment to ensure safety, particularly during motion planning. Existing methods lack generalizability and precision, prompting the need for improvement.

Method: A general approach is developed by combining advanced collision probability estimation with severity metrics, capable of handling different types of collision scenarios.

Result: The method is computationally efficient and supports individualized severity functions for varying collision types. Supplemental programming code is provided.

Conclusion: The proposed risk estimation approach enhances accuracy and generalizability in safety assessments, and its computational efficiency makes it suitable for real-time automated vehicle motion planning.

Abstract: Safety is a central requirement for automated vehicles. As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semantic consistency and leverage pre-existing knowledge for robotic object recognition, overcoming limitations of purely data-driven approaches.

Method: The system constructs a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG) that incorporates contextual priors and external semantic knowledge (such as ConceptNet) through a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network.

Result: The method enhances scene understanding by moving beyond frame-by-frame analysis, improving robustness and consistency in object interpretation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates improved object recognition with an expectation-biased inference technique, aiming for integration into robotic platforms.

Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced robotic object recognition, purely data-driven approaches often lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage valuable, pre-existing knowledge about the environment. This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CADGrasp is a two-stage algorithm designed to address the challenges of dexterous grasping in cluttered environments using single-view point cloud inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of dexterous grasping where issues arise from high degrees of freedom, potential collisions, occlusion, and complex object geometries.

Method: CADGrasp employs a two-stage process: first, it predicts Sparse IBS, a compact representation for optimization using an occupancy-diffusion model and force closure filtering; second, it employs energy functions and ranking strategies based on Sparse IBS to optimize dexterous grasp poses.

Result: The proposed method effectively mitigates collisions and achieves high grasp success rates across diverse objects and complex environments, validated by experiments in simulated and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach proves capable of generating stable and collision-free dexterous grasp poses, showing promise for handling complex grasping tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

### [276] [Systematic Evaluation of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Parameters for Enhancing Gait Stability During Ground Slip Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15056)
*Maria T. Tagliaferri,Inseung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study investigates how to optimize hip exoskeletons to improve walking stability, focusing on the interaction of torque magnitude and duration during slip perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major cause of injury and mortality in older adults, and current exoskeletons are designed for energy efficiency without prioritizing gait stability.

Method: The study tested adjustments in torque magnitude and duration provided by hip exoskeletons in individuals undergoing slip perturbations, using whole-body angular momentum as a measure of stability.

Result: Researchers found that assistance duration is critical, with stability improvements varying based on the interaction of assistance magnitude and duration. Stability-focused settings reduced WBAM by 25.7% compared to energy-optimized settings.

Conclusion: Exoskeletons optimized purely for energy savings are insufficient for stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused control requires lifespan-specific personalization and attention to temporal parameters, offering promise for reducing fall risks in older adults.

Abstract: Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.

TL;DR: The study examines how users of varying levels of expertise supervise robots, analyze their intervention decisions, and discern patterns between novice, intermediate, and expert users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diverse user expertise affects supervision tasks and the performance of human-robot teams.

Method: A user study with 27 participants supervising a robot in a simulator, examining intervention decisions and analyzing data for different expertise levels.

Result: Identified differences in intervention timing and decision-making strategies among novice, intermediate, and expert users.

Conclusion: Expertise level influences how users perceive information and interact with robots, which has implications for designing interfaces and training programs for human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: With increasing levels of robot autonomy, robots are increasingly being supervised by users with varying levels of robotics expertise. As the diversity of the user population increases, it is important to understand how users with different expertise levels approach the supervision task and how this impacts performance of the human-robot team. This exploratory study investigates how operators with varying expertise levels perceive information and make intervention decisions when supervising a remote robot. We conducted a user study (N=27) where participants supervised a robot autonomously exploring four unknown tunnel environments in a simulator, and provided waypoints to intervene when they believed the robot had encountered difficulties. By analyzing the interaction data and questionnaire responses, we identify differing patterns in intervention timing and decision-making strategies across novice, intermediate, and expert users.

### [278] [V-CAGE: Context-Aware Generation and Verification for Scalable Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15164)
*Yaru Liu,Ao-bo Wang,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces V-CAGE, a framework to improve synthetic dataset generation for learning manipulation tasks by ensuring physical plausibility, semantic correctness, and coherent planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data generation often results in physically implausible scenes and language-driven programs that fail to meet task semantics, creating challenges for learning long-horizon embodied behaviors.

Method: V-CAGE enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis, hierarchically decomposes high-level goals into primitives for coherent action sequences, and uses VLM-based verification loops to ensure semantic correctness.

Result: Experiments show that V-CAGE generates physically consistent and semantically correct datasets, leading to improved success rates and generalization in manipulation tasks compared to non-verified methods.

Conclusion: V-CAGE provides a robust solution for generating synthetic datasets, overcoming limitations in physical and semantic fidelity to enhance downstream policy learning for complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "get ready for work") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out "silent failures" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.

TL;DR: MonoRace is a cutting-edge system for autonomous drone racing that uses a monocular camera and IMU, achieving notable success in competition environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance robotics research by developing a lightweight, resource-efficient AI capable of competitive autonomous drone racing under extreme conditions.

Method: The system incorporates neural network-based gate segmentation, refined state estimation through offline optimization, geometry-based adjustments for onboard data, and a neural network-driven guidance and control system directly sending motor commands.

Result: MonoRace surpassed all AI and human competitors, setting a performance benchmark in the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition.

Conclusion: This research pushes the boundaries of autonomous drone racing technology, proving its capability for high-speed operations in competitive environments.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the localization of memory bugs in C programs by mimicking human debugging strategies.

Method: The system uses a combination of large language model reasoning and guided decision-making techniques to analyze the input source code and bug reports for identifying bug locations.

Result: CMind outputs a hypothesis about the possible location of the bug and the rationale behind its inference.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted debugging tools in effectively localizing memory bugs by leveraging strategies observed in human programmers.

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents CMind, an artificial intelligence agent for localizing C memory bugs. The novel aspect to CMind is that it follows steps that we observed human programmers perform during empirical study of those programmers finding memory bugs in C programs. The input to the tool is a C program's source code and a bug report describing the problem. The output is the tool's hypothesis about the reason for the bug and its location. CMind reads the bug report to find potential entry points to the program, then navigates the program's source code, analyzes that source code, and generates a hypothesis location and rationale that fit a template. The tool combines large language model reasoning with guided decision making we encoded to mimic human behavior. The video demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/_vVd0LRvVHI.

TL;DR: The paper compares 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners by studying their scope, detection capabilities, and usability, revealing diverse interpretations of security weaknesses and culminating in actionable developer recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rising threat of software supply chain attacks on GitHub Actions workflows and the need for a systematic understanding of the tools available to mitigate these threats.

Method: The authors established a taxonomy of 10 workflow security weaknesses, systematically tested 9 scanners on 596 workflows, and analyzed their performance and usability.

Result: The study finds significant variability in the scanners’ scope and interpretation of security weaknesses, leading to diverse results in terms of detected issues and use patterns.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by offering actionable recommendations to developers to improve the security of GitHub Actions workflows, emphasizing the diverse approaches of available scanners.

Abstract: GitHub Actions is a widely used platform that allows developers to automate the build and deployment of their projects through configurable workflows. As the platform's popularity continues to grow, it has become a target of choice for recent software supply chain attacks. These attacks exploit excessive permissions, ambiguous versions, or the absence of artifact integrity checks to compromise workflows. In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.
  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.
  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses. Based on this empirical evidence, we make actionable recommendations for developers to harden their GitHub Actions workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in systematic analyses of ABAP code generation by exploring how effectively LLMs generate correct and functional ABAP code and utilize compiler feedback for iterative improvement.

Method: Empirical analysis of 180 tasks in a benchmark comprising adapted HumanEval tasks and SAP scenarios, testing the performance of various LLMs in generating ABAP code.

Result: Powerful LLMs achieve about 75% success after multiple iterations and effectively leverage compiler feedback, whereas smaller models perform significantly worse.

Conclusion: Powerful LLMs show great potential for ABAP development, especially in iterative error correction processes.

Abstract: This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the token consumption patterns in an LLM-based multi-agent (LLM-MA) system during the software development life cycle, highlighting inefficiencies in token usage, especially during iterative phases like code review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of understanding around operational efficiency and token usage in LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly in software engineering tasks, which affects practical adoption due to cost and environmental concerns.

Method: The authors used the ChatDev framework with a GPT-5 reasoning model to analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks, mapping distinct phases like Design, Coding, Code Review, etc., and then quantified token distribution across these stages.

Result: Findings show the Code Review stage dominates token usage (59.4% of tokens on average), with input tokens being the largest proportion (53.9%), indicating inefficiencies in agent collaboration processes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that iterative refinement and verification stages are the major contributors to token costs, proposing their methodology as a predictive and optimization tool for token-efficient workflows, and encourages future research to focus on improving agent collaboration protocols.

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems are increasingly applied to automate complex software engineering tasks such as requirements engineering, code generation, and testing. However, their operational efficiency and resource consumption remain poorly understood, hindering practical adoption due to unpredictable costs and environmental impact. To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.
  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in QUBO development, including mathematical complexity, hardware limitations, and insufficient software engineering processes, which hinder practical adoption.

Method: The authors developed AQUA, a structured framework for QUBO software engineering, using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach. They adapted the Scrum methodology to divide QUBO/QA development into four stages: modeling, algorithm selection, implementation, and deployment.

Conclusion: The study contributes a systematic software engineering process tailored for QUBO/QA development, validated empirically, and providing a structured pathway for industrial and research adoption.

Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a field of operations research that is attracting growing interest due to the recent availability of quantum hardware targeted at solving QUBO problems.

### [285] [HELIOS: Hierarchical Graph Abstraction for Structure-Aware LLM Decompilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14598)
*Yonatan Gizachew Achamyeleh,Harsh Thomare,Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HELIOS improves binary code decompilation by framing it as structured reasoning, enhancing compilability and correctness across various architectures without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based code decompilation does not leverage control flow graphs, leading to fragile and inconsistent results.

Method: HELIOS converts binary control flow and function call summaries into hierarchical text representations, which are processed by general-purpose LLMs, supplemented by compiler feedback.

Result: HELIOS significantly raises object file compilability (up to 94%) and improves functional correctness across multiple architectures while maintaining syntax consistency.

Conclusion: HELIOS is a valuable tool for reverse engineering, producing recompilable and semantically accurate code across diverse hardware architectures without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc{HELIOS}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc{HELIOS} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build.
  On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt{x86\_64}, \textsc{HELIOS} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc{HELIOS} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc{HELIOS} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets.

### [286] [ARFT-Transformer: Modeling Metric Dependencies for Cross-Project Aging-Related Bug Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14731)
*Shuning Ge,Fangyun Qin,Xiaohui Wan,Yang Liu,Qian Dai,Zheng Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based framework to improve cross-project Aging-Related Bug (ARB) prediction, addressing issues like domain adaptation and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software aging caused by Aging-Related Bugs impacts long-term software systems. Existing ARB prediction approaches face challenges such as data scarcity, cross-project distribution differences, and class imbalances.

Method: The proposed ARFT-Transformer employs a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture inter-metric dependencies and uses Focal Loss to better handle class imbalance during prediction.

Result: Experimental results show ARFT-Transformer achieves up to 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric compared to other methods, across single- and multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: ARFT-Transformer improves performance in cross-project ARB prediction tasks by addressing inter-metric dependency and class imbalance issues.

Abstract: Software systems that run for long periods often suffer from software aging, which is typically caused by Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs). To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric.

*Konstantin Poddubnyy,Igor Vozniak,Nils Lipp,Ivan Burmistrov,Davit Hovhannisyan,Christian Mueller,Philipp Slusallek*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ARISE is a tool that converts natural language prompts into executable traffic scenario scripts through iterative refinement using LLMs and simulation testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited quality and diversity in training data for collision-free trajectory planners, particularly in rare traffic scenarios.

Method: ARISE employs multi-stage iterative refining with LLMs, testing scenarios' executability in simulation software, and improving them using structured diagnostics.

Result: ARISE shows superior performance in generating realistic, semantically accurate, and executable traffic scenarios compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ARISE offers a robust approach to scenario generation, reducing manual intervention and significantly improving the reliability of synthetic traffic datasets.

Abstract: The effectiveness of collision-free trajectory planners depends on the quality and diversity of training data, especially for rare scenarios. A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness.

### [288] [FastFI: Enhancing API Call-Site Robustness in Microservice-Based Systems with Fault Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14800)
*Yuzhen Tan,Jian Wang,Shuaiyu Xie,Bing Li,Yunqing Yong,Neng Zhang,Shaolin Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FastFI, a framework for fault-injection in microservices, reduces fault-injection time by 76% while identifying high-impact APIs for improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and limitations of traditional and heuristic-based fault injection techniques caused by increasing microservice complexity.

Method: Introduces FastFI with a DFS-based solver and dynamic injection mechanism for identifying faults and actionable guidance for hardening call sites.

Result: FastFI reduced fault-injection time by 76.12% on benchmarks while maintaining resource efficiency and identifying critical APIs.

Conclusion: FastFI demonstrates significant improvements in fault-injection efficiency and robustness in microservice architectures.

Abstract: Fault injection is a key technique for assessing software reliability, enabling proactive detection of system defects before they manifest in production. However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead. Moreover, FastFI accurately identifies high-impact APIs and provides actionable guidance for call-site hardening.

*Tanja E. J. Vos,Tijs van der Storm,Alexander Serebrenik,Lionel Briand,Roberto Di Cosmo,J. -M Bruel,Benoît Combemale*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the centrality of software engineering in enabling advancements in critical technologies and advocates for its recognition as a strategic, foundational discipline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software engineering is often perceived as a secondary component despite being essential for advancements in AI, quantum computing, and cybersecurity.

Method: The paper presents a position advocating for greater investment and recognition of software engineering as a scientific discipline to support sustainable and secure digital technologies.

Result: This advocacy highlights the pressing need for a paradigm shift where software engineering is acknowledged as a pivotal scientific field.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the long-term sustainability and sovereignty of digital technologies depends on positioning software engineering research as a priority.

Abstract: Software engineering is the invisible infrastructure of the digital age. Every breakthrough in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, photonics, and cybersecurity relies on advances in software engineering, yet the field is too often treated as a supportive digital component rather than as a strategic, enabling discipline. In policy frameworks, including major European programmes, software appears primarily as a building block within other technologies, while the scientific discipline of software engineering remains largely absent. This position paper argues that the long-term sustainability, dependability, and sovereignty of digital technologies depend on investment in software engineering research. It is a call to reclaim the identity of software engineering.

*Martin Obaidi,Kushtrim Qengaj,Hannah Deters,Jakob Droste,Marc Herrmann,Kurt Schneider,Jil Klünder*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how structural, contextual, and linguistic features of Stack Overflow explanations contribute to their perceived usefulness, concluding that clarity and substance play a larger role than sentiment polarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what makes explanations effective in requirements communication and software engineering, particularly focusing on features like content richness, timing, and sentiment.

Method: Analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow using text analysis and statistical modeling to correlate explanation attributes with perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes).

Result: Structural and contextual factors like length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation positively affect usefulness. Sentiment polarity has negligible effect.

Conclusion: Clarity, substance, and transparency in explanations are crucial for effective communication in SE, offering practical signals for reducing ambiguity and supporting rationale articulation in requirements communication.

Abstract: Explanations are essential in software engineering (SE) and requirements communication, helping stakeholders clarify ambiguities, justify design choices, and build shared understanding. Online Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations. It contributes methodological transparency through open data and replication materials, and conceptual insight by relating observed communication patterns to principles of requirements communication. The findings offer evidence-based implications for how developers and RE practitioners can craft clearer and more effective explanations, potentially supporting fairer communication in both open and organizational contexts. From an RE perspective, these determinants can be interpreted as practical signals for ambiguity reduction and rationale articulation in day-to-day requirements communication.

*Chansong You,Hyun Deok Choi,Jingun Hong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based method to automatically fix implicit data loss warnings in large C++ projects, achieving high developer acceptance rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fixing implicit data loss warnings in large C++ projects, which typically require manual effort and risk degrading performance.

Method: The method integrates the Language Server Protocol (LSP), Tree-sitter for code analysis, and LLMs for decision-making and generating fixes, with performance-conscious evaluations.

Result: The approach achieved a 92.73% acceptance rate for fixes during code reviews and reduced performance-degrading changes by 39.09% compared to a baseline, coming close to human developer solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based method can effectively reduce manual effort for fixing warnings while maintaining code quality and is suitable for integration into existing development workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to automatically fix implicit data loss warnings in large C++ projects using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach uses the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to gather context, Tree-sitter to extract relevant code, and LLMs to make decisions and generate fixes. The method evaluates the necessity of range checks concerning performance implications and generates appropriate fixes. We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy. This result was 13.56% behind the optimal solutions created by human developers. These findings demonstrate that our LLM-based approach can reduce the manual effort to address compiler warnings while maintaining code quality and performance in a real-world scenario. Our automated approach shows promise for integration into existing development workflows, potentially improving code maintenance practices in complex C++ software projects.

*Srinath Srinivasan,Tim Menzies,Marcelo D'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SmartOracle uses Large Language Model sub-agents to automate oracle-based triage in differential fuzzing of JavaScript, resulting in high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual oracle construction for JavaScript differential testing is expensive, error-prone, and requires repetitive effort when the specification evolves.

Method: The authors propose SmartOracle, which utilizes sub-agents powered by Large Language Models to synthesize evidence and validate outputs efficiently through specialized workflows.

Result: SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate on benchmarks, reduces analysis time 4x, lowers API costs 10x, and identifies previously unknown bugs in major JavaScript engines.

Conclusion: The SmartOracle approach improves triage accuracy and efficiency in JavaScript testing, and it shows potential for broader applicability in other software systems.

Abstract: Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.
  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict.
  For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS.
  The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.

*Siyu Yu,Yifan Wu,Junjielong Xu,Ying Fu,Ning Wang,Maoyin Liu,Pancheng Jiang,Xiang Zhang,Tong Jia,Pinjia He,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeLog, a novel log compressor that improves pattern-based grouping for better compression ratios on log data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsatisfactory performance of parser-based log compression on complex production logs due to the degradation in log parsing accuracy.

Method: Developed DeLog, utilizing a Pattern Signature Synthesis mechanism to improve the grouping and encoding of tokens for effective compression.

Result: DeLog achieved state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed across 16 public and 10 production datasets.

Conclusion: Higher parsing accuracy alone does not improve compression ratio. Effective pattern-based token grouping is the key to achieving better log compression results, as demonstrated by DeLog.

Abstract: Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio?
  To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.
  Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the effectiveness of Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning on Large Code Models (LCMs), aimed at optimizing performance across code generation, translation, and summarization tasks, while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational costs of fully fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the capability of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA for optimizing multiple code-related tasks.

Method: The researchers apply Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across representative software engineering tasks such as code generation, translation, and summarization. They evaluate functional correctness using execution-based and similarity-based metrics, alongside code quality analysis.

Result: Multi-task QLoRA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models show balanced correctness and quality, while smaller models retain functional correctness but face more quality-related issues.

Conclusion: Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, optimizes computational efficiency, and proves to be a practical approach for multi-task code-related workflows, with scalability advantages in larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.

TL;DR: This paper investigates metadata on PyPI libraries, identifying reasons for incomplete links to repositories and donation platforms using a study of 50,000 authors/maintainers and topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many PyPI packages lack crucial metadata like repository and donation link information, impacting transparency and sustainability. The paper explores reasons for these omissions.

Method: The study surveyed 50,000 PyPI authors/maintainers with over 1,400 responses analyzed using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling. Responses were validated with expert reviews and assessed for robustness.

Result: The study revealed motivations for linking repositories and donation platforms, as well as barriers such as laziness, oversight, skepticism, and technical friction. Cross-cutting issues such as outdated links and unclear guidance were identified.

Conclusion: Recommendations for improving PyPI metadata practices are provided, with validation of the topic modeling approach for analyzing survey data.

Abstract: Metadata of libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI)-including links to source code repositories and donation platforms-plays a critical role in supporting the transparency, trust, and sustainability of open-source libraries. Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGA, a tool for enhancing Python vulnerability detection using advanced control-flow analysis and domain-specific language, achieving high accuracy and significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for Python vulnerability detection only identify a limited range of vulnerabilities, creating a need for a more comprehensive detection method.

Method: The paper proposes SAGA, which includes a control- and data-flow parser and a domain-specific language to define static code properties. This system is further enhanced by a library targeting security properties like integrity and confidentiality.

Result: SAGA achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity when detecting vulnerabilities in a dataset of 108 samples. It also performed faster than baseline tools, completing analysis in under 31 seconds.

Conclusion: SAGA outperforms existing tools in detecting a wide range of Python vulnerabilities with high efficiency and accuracy, providing a valuable tool for security-focused Python development.

Abstract: Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects.
  In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties.
  We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.

TL;DR: The paper examines why AI-authored pull requests (PRs) succeed or fail in software repositories, based on a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of 33,000 PRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behaviors and success factors of autonomous AI coding agents contributing to real-world software projects, identifying challenges in merge outcomes.

Method: A mixed-method study involving quantitative analysis of 33,000 PRs along dimensions like task type and CI results, combined with qualitative coding and taxonomy derivation based on 600 not-merged PRs.

Result: Tasks on documentation, CI, and build updates succeed most, while performance and bug-fix tasks frequently fail. Larger code changes and CI/CD failures correlate with rejection. New rejection patterns like lack of engagement, duplicates, and misalignments are found.

Conclusion: Critical socio-technical and human-AI factors affect the success of AI coding agents. Insights from the study can inform improvements in agentic workflows and collaboration dynamics.

Abstract: AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.

TL;DR: The paper studies bugs in LLM agents, analyzing over 1,187 instances from forums and demonstrating BugReAct as an efficient bug annotation tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging LLM agents is challenging due to the early stage of development and lack of community resources.

Method: Analyzed posts and code snippets about LLM agent bugs on forums and tested an automated bug annotation tool, BugReAct, using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Result: BugReAct effectively annotated bug characteristics with high accuracy, costing only 0.01 USD per instance.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of bugs in LLM agents and demonstrates a cost-effective tool for bug identification and annotation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent application development. While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between perinatal factors, brain anomalies, and cerebral volumetry in very and extreme preterm infants using cerebral MRI at term-equivalent age.

Method: A cohort of preterm infants (<32 weeks gestation) underwent cerebral MRI. Brain anomalies were assessed using the Kidokoro scoring system, while cerebral volumetry was also performed. Relationships between 9 clinical factors, Kidokoro scores, and brain volumes were analyzed.

Result: Mechanical ventilation was identified as a risk factor for brain anomalies and reduced cerebral volumes, while prolonged parenteral nutrition served as a protective factor for white matter anomalies. Severe brain lesions correlated with reduced cerebral volumes.

Conclusion: Perinatal treatment factors, such as mechanical ventilation and nutritional support, significantly impact brain anomalies and volumes in preterm infants. Combining qualitative and quantitative MRI analyses is beneficial to assess cerebral health.

Abstract: Background: Being born very or extreme preterm is a major source of cerebral anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders, whose occurrence depends on many perinatal factors. A better understanding of these factors could be provided by cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age (TEA). Objective: To investigate, through cerebral TEA-MRIs, the relationship between the main perinatal factors, the occurrence of cerebral anomalies, and cerebral volumetry. Methods: We assembled a cohort of preterm babies born before 32 weeks of gestation who underwent a cerebral TEA-MRI. We assessed cerebral anomalies using a radiological scoring system -- the Kidokoro scoring -- and performed cerebral volumetry. We investigated the relationships between 9 clinical factors (birth characteristics, resuscitation treatments{\ldots}), Kidokoro scores, and brain volumes. Results: Among 110 preterms who underwent a cerebral MRI at TEA, only 6% suffered moderate-to-severe brain anomalies. We identified mechanical ventilation as a risk factor for cerebral anomalies (adjusted Odds-Ratio aOR = 4.6, 95% Confidence Interval CI [1.7-12.8]) and prolonged parenteral nutrition as a protective factor for white matter anomalies (aOR = 0.2, 95%CI [0.1-0.8]). Mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) and being born small for gestational age (p < 0.001) were risk factors for the reduction of cerebral volumes. An increase in brain lesion severity was associated with decreased cerebral volumes (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of treatment-related perinatal factors on the occurrence of cerebral anomalies in very and extreme preterms, and the interest in using both qualitative (Kidokoro scoring) and quantitative (volumetry) MRI-tools.

### [300] [Power-Law Scaling in the Classification Performance of Small-Scale Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14961)
*Zhengdi Zhang,Cong Han,Wenjun Xia*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the classification capabilities of small-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs), emphasizing the relationship between accuracy and network parameters, with critical insights from utilizing large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the efficiency of biological neural computation and explore AI-aided approaches in identifying functional relationships within SNN configurations.

Method: Investigates scaling factors affecting classification accuracy in spiking neural networks using the novel LIF neuron model and compares traditional mathematical fitting techniques (linear, polynomial) with large language models to analyze functional relationships.

Result: Classification accuracy is scaled primarily by the number of classification categories in a power-law manner, while neuron count and stimulus nodes contribute less significantly. LLMs outperform traditional models in proposing concise and accurate forms of scaling descriptions.

Conclusion: The use of LLMs demonstrates enhanced scientific discovery potential, paving the way for innovative approaches in understanding neural computations and applying AI for modeling biological systems effectively.

Abstract: This paper investigates the classification capability of small-scale spiking neural networks based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. We analyze the relationship between classification accuracy and three factors: the number of neurons, the number of stimulus nodes, and the number of classification categories. Notably, we employ a large language model (LLM) to assist in discovering the underlying functional relationships among these variables, and compare its performance against traditional methods such as linear and polynomial fitting. Experimental results show that classification accuracy follows a power-law scaling primarily with the number of categories, while the effects of neuron count and stimulus nodes are relatively minor. A key advantage of the LLM-based approach is its ability to propose plausible functional forms beyond pre-defined equation templates, often leading to more concise or accurate mathematical descriptions of the observed scaling laws. This finding has important implications for understanding efficient computation in biological neural systems and for pioneering new paradigms in AI-aided scientific discovery.

### [301] [Single-Node Wilson--Cowan Model Accounts for Speech-Evoked $γ$-Band Deficits in Schizophrenia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15032)
*Zhengdi Zhang,Yan Xu,Wenjun Xia*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates gamma-band activity differences in schizophrenia using a simulation model and finds deficits mainly due to E/I operating point shifts rather than input differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding deficits in gamma activity to explore excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalances in schizophrenia (SCZ).

Method: Developed a cochlear-inspired speech front end coupled with a Wilson-Cowan E/I model. Simulated gamma responses across three conditions (Healthy, SCZ-speech, SCZ-semantics) using metrics like ERSPγ and γ%.

Result: Gamma deficits in SCZ conditions align with E/I operating point shifts. Demonstrated a consistent hierarchy and effects of pharmacological analogs on gamma. The model supports interpretability of findings.

Conclusion: Gamma deficits in schizophrenia arise from altered E/I dynamics rather than input differences. The model provides a reusable framework for mechanistic insights and cross-population studies.

Abstract: Cortical gamma ($γ$)-band activity reflects local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. In schizophrenia (SCZ), reduced task-evoked gamma suggests altered E/I dynamics, but it is unclear whether differences stem from input properties or systematic shifts in E/I operating point and gain. We coupled a cochlear-inspired speech front end to a Wilson-Cowan E/I model to simulate gamma responses across three conditions: Healthy, SCZ-speech, and SCZ-semantics. Metrics included event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP$_γ$) and threshold-time fraction ($γ%$). A stable hierarchy emerged: Healthy(speech/semantics) $>$ SCZ(speech) $>$ SCZ(semantics), robust under equal-energy control and gain perturbations. Network dynamics coincided with single-node solutions, supporting interpretability. Pharmacological analogs showed bidirectional effects: reduced inhibition lowered $γ$, while reduced excitation increased $γ$, with no self-sustained oscillations. Findings indicate SCZ gamma deficits align more with shifts in E/I operating point and gain than input differences. This pipeline provides a testable, reusable mechanistic framework for speech-evoked gamma and a baseline for cross-population studies.

### [302] [Meta Flow Maps enable scalable reward alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14430)
*Peter Potaptchik,Adhi Saravanan,Abbas Mammadov,Alvaro Prat,Michael S. Albergo,Yee Whye Teh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes Meta Flow Maps (MFMs) to improve computational efficiency in controlling generative models by enabling one-step stochastic posterior sampling and efficient value function estimation, reducing the need for costly simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling generative models is computationally expensive due to the need for value function estimation, which typically requires costly trajectory simulations or posterior calculations.

Method: The authors propose MFMs, a framework extending consistency models and flow maps to the stochastic regime, enabling one-step posterior sampling and differentiable reparametrization for efficient value function estimation.

Result: The proposed MFM approach significantly reduces computation costs and outperforms a Best-of-1000 baseline on ImageNet in tasks involving inference-time steering and unbiased fine-tuning, demonstrating superior efficiency.

Conclusion: MFMs present a novel solution to computational bottlenecks in generative model control, offering a scalable and efficient method for both inference steering and reward-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Controlling generative models is computationally expensive. This is because optimal alignment with a reward function--whether via inference-time steering or fine-tuning--requires estimating the value function. This task demands access to the conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(x_1|x_t)$, the distribution of clean data $x_1$ consistent with an intermediate state $x_t$, a requirement that typically compels methods to resort to costly trajectory simulations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Meta Flow Maps (MFMs), a framework extending consistency models and flow maps into the stochastic regime. MFMs are trained to perform stochastic one-step posterior sampling, generating arbitrarily many i.i.d. draws of clean data $x_1$ from any intermediate state. Crucially, these samples provide a differentiable reparametrization that unlocks efficient value function estimation. We leverage this capability to solve bottlenecks in both paradigms: enabling inference-time steering without inner rollouts, and facilitating unbiased, off-policy fine-tuning to general rewards. Empirically, our single-particle steered-MFM sampler outperforms a Best-of-1000 baseline on ImageNet across multiple rewards at a fraction of the compute.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores extending Laplace learning to infinite-dimensional spaces, specifically analyzing data generated by Gaussian measures in Hilbert spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laplace learning struggles with infinite-dimensional spaces due to the absence of Lebesgue measure, requiring new approaches for effective analysis.

Method: Authors analyze graph Dirichlet energy convergence using Gaussian measures on Hilbert space as a first step towards understanding infinite-dimensional data.

Result: Pointwise convergence of graph Dirichlet energy in the Gaussian measure context has been proven, providing theoretical groundwork.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of Laplace learning in infinite-dimensional spaces, opening avenues for further research.

Abstract: Laplace learning is a semi-supervised method, a solution for finding missing labels from a partially labeled dataset utilizing the geometry given by the unlabeled data points. The method minimizes a Dirichlet energy defined on a (discrete) graph constructed from the full dataset. In finite dimensions the asymptotics in the large (unlabeled) data limit are well understood with convergence from the graph setting to a continuum Sobolev semi-norm weighted by the Lebesgue density of the data-generating measure. The lack of the Lebesgue measure on infinite-dimensional spaces requires rethinking the analysis if the data aren't finite-dimensional. In this paper we make a first step in this direction by analyzing the setting when the data are generated by a Gaussian measure on a Hilbert space and proving pointwise convergence of the graph Dirichlet energy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: FedRD is a communication-efficient framework for federated risk difference estimation in distributed survival data, addressing server-dependency and enhancing interpretability in multi-site medical research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in privacy-preserving model co-training, specifically server-dependent architectures and lack of clinical interpretability in survival data analysis.

Method: Developed a server-independent framework, FedRD, which minimizes communication and supports valid confidence intervals/hypothesis testing. The unstratified model achieves asymptotic equivalence to pooled individual-level analysis.

Result: FedRD improves estimation accuracy and prediction performance in both simulated and real-world clinical datasets compared to local and federated baseline models.

Conclusion: FedRD provides a feasible solution for absolute risk assessment in privacy-restricted, distributed medical studies with efficient communication and robust statistical guarantees.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving model co-training in medical research is often hindered by server-dependent architectures incompatible with protected hospital data systems and by the predominant focus on relative effect measures (hazard ratios) which lack clinical interpretability for absolute survival risk assessment. We propose FedRD, a communication-efficient framework for federated risk difference estimation in distributed survival data. Unlike typical federated learning frameworks (e.g., FedAvg) that require persistent server connections and extensive iterative communication, FedRD is server-independent with minimal communication: one round of summary statistics exchange for the stratified model and three rounds for the unstratified model. Crucially, FedRD provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing--capabilities absent in FedAvg-based frameworks. We provide theoretical guarantees by establishing the asymptotic properties of FedRD and prove that FedRD (unstratified) is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis. Simulation studies and real-world clinical applications across different countries demonstrate that FedRD outperforms local and federated baselines in both estimation accuracy and prediction performance, providing an architecturally feasible solution for absolute risk assessment in privacy-restricted, multi-site clinical studies.

### [305] [Semi-Supervised Mixture Models under the Concept of Missing at Radom with Margin Confidence and Aranda Ordaz Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14631)
*Jinyang Liao,Ziyang Lyu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised learning framework leveraging Gaussian mixture models (GMM) addressing Missing at Random (MAR) data issues. It incorporates a specific mechanism to model classification uncertainty and missingness probability for reliable label imputation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases and enhance robustness in semi-supervised learning when dealing with Missing at Random data, particularly by acknowledging and modeling the missingness mechanism.

Method: Developed a Gaussian mixture model-based framework explicitly parameterizing missingness mechanisms. Introduced margin confidence and the Aranda Ordaz link function to model uncertainty-missingness relationships. An Expectation Conditional Maximization algorithm was utilized for estimating all related parameters and imputing missing labels.

Result: The framework effectively reduced biases from ignoring the missingness mechanism, showed improved robustness, and delivered reliable classification under MAR scenarios, even with substantial missing labels.

Conclusion: Modeling the missingness mechanism with uncertainty considerations enhances the reliability and performance of semi-supervised learning in handling substantial MAR data issues.

Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for Gaussian mixture modelling under a Missing at Random (MAR) mechanism. The method explicitly parameterizes the missingness mechanism by modelling the probability of missingness as a function of classification uncertainty. To quantify classification uncertainty, we introduce margin confidence and incorporate the Aranda Ordaz (AO) link function to flexibly capture the asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning. The resulting uncertainty-aware framework delivers reliable classification performance in realistic MAR scenarios with substantial proportions of missing labels.

*Michelle Ching,Ioana Popescu,Nico Smith,Tianyi Ma,William G. Underwood,Richard J. Samworth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proves that transformers for in-context learning can achieve a minimax-optimal rate of convergence in nonparametric regression with fewer parameters and pretrained sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve the capability of transformers in achieving optimal performance for nonparametric regression, while reducing computational resources.

Method: Proving that transformers approximate local polynomial estimators by using kernel-weighted polynomial bases and gradient descent, requiring fewer parameters and pretraining sequences.

Result: The proposed approach achieves the minimax-optimal rate of convergence in mean squared error with reduced transformer parameters and pretraining sequences.

Conclusion: Transformers are efficient in nonparametric regression learning when designed to implement local polynomial estimation, providing optimal results with fewer resources.

Abstract: We study in-context learning for nonparametric regression with $α$-Hölder smooth regression functions, for some $α>0$. We prove that, with $n$ in-context examples and $d$-dimensional regression covariates, a pretrained transformer with $Θ(\log n)$ parameters and $Ω\bigl(n^{2α/(2α+d)}\log^3 n\bigr)$ pretraining sequences can achieve the minimax-optimal rate of convergence $O\bigl(n^{-2α/(2α+d)}\bigr)$ in mean squared error. Our result requires substantially fewer transformer parameters and pretraining sequences than previous results in the literature. This is achieved by showing that transformers are able to approximate local polynomial estimators efficiently by implementing a kernel-weighted polynomial basis and then running gradient descent.

*Kexin Wang,Salil Bhate,João M. Pereira,Joe Kileel,Matylda Figlerowicz,Anna Seigal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Context Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA), a method to capture shared variation factors across multiple contexts in data, overcoming PCA's limitations in this regard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCA methods cannot systematically capture shared factors of variation across multiple contexts in data, such as diseases, cell types, or text corpus.

Method: The authors propose MCPCA, extending PCA theoretically and algorithmically to decompose data into factors shared across subsets of contexts, without merging or restricting the data to a single context.

Result: Applied to gene expression data, MCPCA identified variations linked to cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings, MCPCA uncovered historic debates on human nature. Both results demonstrated findings unavailable through current methods.

Conclusion: MCPCA generalizes PCA for multi-context data analysis, enabling the discovery of shared variation factors across contexts and providing new insights in biological and linguistic domains.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool to capture factors that explain variation in data. Across domains, data are now collected across multiple contexts (for example, individuals with different diseases, cells of different types, or words across texts). While the factors explaining variation in data are undoubtedly shared across subsets of contexts, no tools currently exist to systematically recover such factors. We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades. These axes are not found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts. MCPCA is a principled generalization of PCA to address the challenge of understanding factors underlying data across contexts.

*Felix Schur,Niklas Pfister,Peng Ding,Sach Mukherjee,Jonas Peters*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The authors tackle causal effect estimation under hidden confounding for unpaired X and Y data using environments as instruments and propose a cross-fold GMM-type estimator, ensuring consistency even with a high number of small environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of estimating causal effects when X and Y are observed separately (not jointly) and establish methodology for the case where many environments but few observations per environment are available.

Method: They reformulate the problem as an IV regression using the environment as an instrument and propose a cross-fold sample splitting GMM-type estimator to ensure consistency. Sparse causal effects are considered via l1-regularized estimation with post-selection refitting.

Result: The method is shown to be consistent as the number of environments grows, even when the sample size per environment stays constant.

Conclusion: This work provides a consistent estimator for causal effect estimation in unpaired data settings with hidden confounding, leveraging environment-based instruments and addressing sparsity challenges.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating causal effects under hidden confounding in the following unpaired data setting: we observe some covariates $X$ and an outcome $Y$ under different experimental conditions (environments) but do not observe them jointly; we either observe $X$ or $Y$. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-OOHRI, an augmented reality interface that makes robot capabilities and limitations more transparent through visual elements and explanation tags to improve human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in current human-robot interaction by addressing robots' 'black box' nature, which limits users’ understanding of robots’ capabilities and constraints.

Method: Combines augmented reality (AR) with a vision-language model to visualize robot affordances and constraints via interactive elements like color coding, radial menus, and virtual twins. This is integrated with a physical robot for testing.

Result: Demonstrates that participants can issue effective object-oriented commands, develop a clear understanding of robot limitations, and engage in collaborative task resolution during evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed X-OOHRI system fosters better user understanding and interaction with robotic systems, improving efficiency and effectiveness in collaborative human-robot tasks.

Abstract: Human interaction is essential for issuing personalized instructions and assisting robots when failure is likely. However, robots remain largely black boxes, offering users little insight into their evolving capabilities and limitations. To address this gap, we present explainable object-oriented HRI (X-OOHRI), an augmented reality (AR) interface that conveys robot action possibilities and constraints through visual signifiers, radial menus, color coding, and explanation tags. Our system encodes object properties and robot limits into object-oriented structures using a vision-language model, allowing explanation generation on the fly and direct manipulation of virtual twins spatially aligned within a simulated environment. We integrate the end-to-end pipeline with a physical robot and showcase diverse use cases ranging from low-level pick-and-place to high-level instructions. Finally, we evaluate X-OOHRI through a user study and find that participants effectively issue object-oriented commands, develop accurate mental models of robot limitations, and engage in mixed-initiative resolution.

*Shanshan Zhu,Wenxuan Song,Jiayue Melissa Shi,Dong Whi Yoo,Karthik S. Bhat,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper presents KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion designed to aid users in translating personal health data into meaningful reflections, emphasizing self-reflection rather than performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many personal wellbeing apps encourage goals and structured targets, which may pressure users and lead to judgment and anxiety, rather than supporting meaningful self-reflection.

Method: The authors designed KRIYA with features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. They tested its effectiveness through semi-structured interviews with 18 college students using a prototype.

Result: Interaction with KRIYA allowed users to interpret wellbeing data reflectively rather than focusing on performance metrics, and emotional framing influenced their experiences. Transparency in the process fostered trust.

Conclusion: KRIYA's design demonstrates potential in promoting curiosity, self-compassion, and reflective engagement with personal health data, revealing valuable implications for AI-supported wellbeing tools.

Abstract: Most personal wellbeing apps present summative dashboards of health and physical activity metrics, yet many users struggle to translate this information into meaningful understanding. These apps commonly support engagement through goals, reminders, and structured targets, which can reinforce comparison, judgment, and performance anxiety. To explore a complementary approach that prioritizes self-reflection, we design KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion that supports co-interpretive engagement with personal wellbeing data. KRIYA aims to collaborate with users to explore questions, explanations, and future scenarios through features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 college students interacting with a KRIYA prototype using hypothetical data. Our findings show that through KRIYA interaction, users framed engaging with wellbeing data as interpretation rather than performance, experienced reflection as supportive or pressuring depending on emotional framing, and developed trust through transparency. We discuss design implications for AI companions that support curiosity, self-compassion, and reflective sensemaking of personal health data.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of Gemini Live, an advanced LLM conversational agent, during on-road driving, finding comparable cognitive and visual demands to hands-free phone calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver distraction is a significant contributor to motor vehicle crashes, necessitating analysis of new in-vehicle technologies for safety.

Method: Researchers compared Gemini Live interactions to hands-free phone calls, turn-by-turn guidance, and OSPAN task using Detection Response Task (DRT), eye-tracking, and subjective workload ratings.

Result: Gemini Live shows cognitive and visual demands on par with hands-free phone calls, maintaining low visual demand and adherence to safety thresholds.

Conclusion: Advanced LLM conversational agents embedded via voice interfaces provide safe cognitive and visual interaction levels, suitable for deployment in driving contexts.

Abstract: Driver distraction remains a leading contributor to motor vehicle crashes, necessitating rigorous evaluation of new in-vehicle technologies. This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.

*Simran Kaur,Sara Salimzadeh,Ujwal Gadiraju*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines incentive design in studies on human-AI collaborative decision-making, providing a thematic review and proposing a guideline framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical role of incentive design in ensuring reliable outcomes from human-AI decision-making empirical studies.

Method: Conducted a thematic review of existing research on incentive schemes in human-AI decision-making studies, identifying patterns and challenges.

Result: The paper introduced the Incentive-Tuning Framework—a guideline for designing, reflecting on, and documenting incentive schemes.

Conclusion: Standardised, yet flexible incentive design ensures more reliable and generalizable findings in human-AI decision-making studies.

Abstract: AI has revolutionised decision-making across various fields. Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making.

TL;DR: The study examines accessibility issues of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals and proposes alternative interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inaccessibility of IPAs for DHH individuals who communicate using voice but are hindered by the inability of IPAs to understand deaf-accented speech.

Method: A comparison was made between spoken English with automatic speech recognition, a Wizard-of-Oz setting with re-spoken commands, and a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface integrated with a task prompter.

Result: Quantitative results revealed no significant differences between spoken and touch interaction models, while qualitative findings highlighted varied opinions on usability.

Conclusion: Existing IPAs need to natively support robust recognition of deaf-accented speech, and alternative interaction methods can provide interim solutions.

Abstract: We investigate intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people who can use their voice in everyday communication. The inability of IPAs to understand diverse accents including deaf speech renders them largely inaccessible to non-signing and speaking DHH individuals. Using an Echo Show, we compare the usability of natural language input via spoken English; with Alexa's automatic speech recognition and a Wizard-of-Oz setting with a trained facilitator re-speaking commands against that of a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface in a mixed-methods study. The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered "task prompter," which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs.

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel neural vocoder with prosody-guided harmonic attention and direct complex spectral modeling to improve natural speech synthesis and phase fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in prosody modeling and phase reconstruction in existing neural vocoders, aiming for more robust and pitch-accurate synthetic speech.

Method: The method introduces prosody-guided harmonic attention for voiced segment enhancement and directly predicts complex spectral components. It employs a multi-objective training approach combining adversarial, spectral, and phase-aware losses.

Result: Experiments show 22% reduction in F0 RMSE, 18% decrease in voiced/unvoiced errors, and a 0.15 increase in MOS scores compared to HiFi-GAN and AutoVocoder.

Conclusion: The proposed vocoder significantly improves naturalness, pitch fidelity, and robustness in speech synthesis, establishing a strong standard for expressive neural vocoding.

Abstract: Neural vocoders are central to speech synthesis; despite their success, most still suffer from limited prosody modeling and inaccurate phase reconstruction. We propose a vocoder that introduces prosody-guided harmonic attention to enhance voiced segment encoding and directly predicts complex spectral components for waveform synthesis via inverse STFT. Unlike mel-spectrogram-based approaches, our design jointly models magnitude and phase, ensuring phase coherence and improved pitch fidelity. To further align with perceptual quality, we adopt a multi-objective training strategy that integrates adversarial, spectral, and phase-aware losses. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent gains over HiFi-GAN and AutoVocoder: F0 RMSE reduced by 22 percent, voiced/unvoiced error lowered by 18 percent, and MOS scores improved by 0.15. These results show that prosody-guided attention combined with direct complex spectrum modeling yields more natural, pitch-accurate, and robust synthetic speech, setting a strong foundation for expressive neural vocoding.

*Nouhoum Coulibaly,Ousmane Ly,Michael Leventhal,Ousmane Goro*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study evaluates generative AI's potential in fostering peace narratives and preserving Malian musical heritage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inter-community tensions in Mali by exploring new methods for reconciliation, using Gen AI as a tool to enhance cultural and social cohesion.

Method: The study empirically examines Gen AI's use in musical creation rooted in Mali's languages and traditions, its hybridization with cultural authenticity, and its impact on strengthening social ties.

Result: Experimental findings show Gen AI can amplify local cultural voices effectively within a participatory framework, although challenges like linguistic data availability and ethical concerns remain.

Conclusion: Generative AI has significant potential as a symbolic diplomacy tool for cultural preservation and social cohesion, but must overcome ethical and technical hurdles.

Abstract: This study explores the capacity of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) to contribute to the construction of peace narratives and the revitalization of musical heritage in Mali. The study has been made in a political and social context where inter-community tensions and social fractures motivate a search for new symbolic frameworks for reconciliation. The study empirically explores three questions: (1) how Gen AI can be used as a tool for musical creation rooted in national languages and traditions; (2) to what extent Gen AI systems enable a balanced hybridization between technological innovation and cultural authenticity; and (3) how AI-assisted musical co-creation can strengthen social cohesion and cultural sovereignty. The experimental results suggest that Gen AI, embedded in a culturally conscious participatory framework, can act as a catalyst for symbolic diplomacy, amplifying local voices instead of standardizing them. However, challenges persist regarding the availability of linguistic corpora, algorithmic censorship, and the ethics of generating compositions derived from copyrighted sources.

*Gokul Karthik Kumar,Ludovick Lepauloux,Hakim Hacid*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces WavLink, an audio-text embedding model based on Whisper encoder, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance with compact embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance audio-text embedding models by effectively leveraging Whisper encoder, unlike prior CLAP-based models, to reduce embedding size and improve retrieval performance.

Method: WavLink integrates a Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder using a systematic exploration of training configurations and a two-stage training recipe.

Result: WavLink achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance with 8x smaller embeddings and competitive results on AIR-Bench tasks.

Conclusion: WavLink demonstrates scalability and effective audio-text embeddings, presenting a compact and high-performing model in the audio-language processing domain.

Abstract: Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more efficient and open-source text-to-music model using state-space models (SSMs), outperforming traditional Transformers with smaller data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve affordability and accessibility of text-to-music generation models by creating an open-source, data-efficient alternative to proprietary and computationally expensive solutions.

Method: The study replaces Transformer backbones with SSMs, tests different SSM variants, and compares them with a hybrid SSM/diffusion model, training from scratch using 457 hours of CC-licensed music.

Result: The SSM-based models are more training-efficient than Transformers, perform competitively even with significantly fewer resources, and maintain performance even at reduced model sizes.

Conclusion: State-space models present a practical, open-source alternative to Transformers for text-to-music generation, offering higher efficiency and reduced computational demands, and resources are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation (TTM) have yielded high-quality results, but often at the cost of extensive compute and the use of large proprietary internal data. To improve the affordability and openness of TTM training, an open-source generative model backbone that is more training- and data-efficient is needed. In this paper, we constrain the number of trainable parameters in the generative model to match that of the MusicGen-small benchmark (with about 300M parameters), and replace its Transformer backbone with the emerging class of state-space models (SSMs). Specifically, we explore different SSM variants for sequence modeling, and compare a single-stage SSM-based design with a decomposable two-stage SSM/diffusion hybrid design. All proposed models are trained from scratch on a purely public dataset comprising 457 hours of CC-licensed music, ensuring full openness. Our experimental findings are three-fold. First, we show that SSMs exhibit superior training efficiency compared to the Transformer counterpart. Second, despite using only 9% of the FLOPs and 2% of the training data size compared to the MusicGen-small benchmark, our model achieves competitive performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests based on MusicCaps captions. Finally, our scaling-down experiment demonstrates that SSMs can maintain competitive performance relative to the Transformer baseline even at the same training budget (measured in iterations), when the model size is reduced to four times smaller. To facilitate the democratization of TTM research, the processed captions, model checkpoints, and source code are available on GitHub via the project page: https://lonian6.github.io/ssmttm/.

*Muntakimur Rahaman,Md Mahmudul Hoque,Md Mehedi Hassain*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces an RNN-based framework for Bangla music genre classification using a novel dataset and achieves 78% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for efficient classification and retrieval of Bangla music genres due to the exponential growth in music data.

Method: The method utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification and employs MFCCs for feature extraction from audio data.

Result: The system achieves a classification accuracy of 78% on Bangla music genres.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential to improve the organization and retrieval of Bangla music genres.

Abstract: Bangla music is enrich in its own music cultures. Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features. The proposed framework facilitates music genre classification by leveraging these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 78%, indicating the system's strong potential to enhance and streamline the organization of Bangla music genres.

TL;DR: The paper adapts the ExoMiner++ framework to TESS Full-Frame Images (FFIs) to improve exoplanet classification and vetting, enabling analysis beyond pre-selected targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the identification and classification of exoplanets from TESS Full-Frame Images (FFIs), which contain more stars than pre-selected targets but pose additional challenges for transit identification and vetting.

Method: The authors adapted and applied the ExoMiner++ 2.0 framework, initially developed for 2-minute TESS data, to classify Threshold Crossing Events in FFI light curves.

Result: The study found that ExoMiner++ 2.0 effectively distinguishes planetary signals, false positives, and instrumental artifacts in FFI light curves, even with the limitations of longer cadence data.

Conclusion: ExoMiner++ 2.0 successfully extends its applicability to the full TESS dataset, supporting comprehensive population studies and aiding follow-up prioritization.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.

TL;DR: This paper presents an agent-based operationalization of the DISARM framework for analyzing Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) activities in social media using AI-driven multi-agent pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance NATO countries' situational awareness and response coordination against Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) in media-rich environments.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline leveraging specialized AI agents to detect manipulative behaviors and map them onto the DISARM framework transparently.

Result: The approach was validated with real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating the FIMI analysis process and improving situational awareness across information-rich environments.

Conclusion: This agent-based operationalization scales manual FIMI analysis work, contributing to collective defense capabilities through improved data interoperability and threat response coordination.

Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler to the collective defense capability--both conventional and hybrid--of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings.

### [321] [Finite-Sample Inference for Sparsely Permuted Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14872)
*Hirofumi Ota,Masaaki Imaizumi*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenging problem of mismatched responses and covariates in linear regression due to an unknown permutation. It proposes a statistical framework combining localization methods and computational techniques for inference and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the statistical challenges arising from the unknown permutation in shuffled/permuted linear regression, which complicates inference due to its discrete nature and factorial-size parameter space.

Method: The paper introduces a new framework involving localization of permutation space via repro samples method, Monte Carlo tests for permutation structure, coefficient inference under alignment uncertainty, and polynomial-time computational approaches for solving linear assignment problems. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also proposed.

Result: The framework demonstrates finite-sample validity, effective detection of mismatches in data, and scalability in practical applications. Extensive simulations and real-world application to Beijing air-quality data corroborate its efficacy.

Conclusion: This study provides a robust statistical framework for addressing permutation and regression challenges, validating its methods both theoretically and practically, and highlighting its utility in real-world data analysis scenarios.

Abstract: We study a noisy linear observation model with an unknown permutation called permuted/shuffled linear regression, where responses and covariates are mismatched and the permutation forms a discrete, factorial-size parameter. This unknown permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also discussed. Extensive simulations and an application to Beijing air-quality data corroborate finite-sample validity, strong power to detect mismatches, and practical scalability.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the consistency of honest decision trees and random forests in regression using elementary proofs and classical smoothing concepts, establishing their convergence to the true regression function under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and simplify the theoretical understanding of the asymptotic behavior of tree-based regression methods, using an elementary approach and connecting them to kernel-type methods.

Method: The authors propose an analysis using straightforward proofs, focusing on weak and uniform convergence, and accommodating ensemble methods like subsampling and bootstrap sampling within their framework.

Result: The study demonstrates that honest trees and forest averages converge (weakly and almost surely) to the true regression function, exhibiting uniform convergence over compact covariate domains.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified and simplified theoretical foundation for tree-based regression methods, advancing their accessibility and demonstrating connections to smoothing and kernel methods.

Abstract: We study various types of consistency of honest decision trees and random forests in the regression setting. In contrast to related literature, our proofs are elementary and follow the classical arguments used for smoothing methods. Under mild regularity conditions on the regression function and data distribution, we establish weak and almost sure convergence of honest trees and honest forest averages to the true regression function, and moreover we obtain uniform convergence over compact covariate domains. The framework naturally accommodates ensemble variants based on subsampling and also a two-stage bootstrap sampling scheme. Our treatment synthesizes and simplifies existing analyses, in particular recovering several results as special cases. The elementary nature of the arguments clarifies the close relationship between data-adaptive partitioning and kernel-type methods, providing an accessible approach to understanding the asymptotic behavior of tree-based methods.

TL;DR: Introduces AxiaBench, a benchmark for meta-evaluation, providing insights and revealing limitations in existing evaluation methods across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdeveloped state of meta-evaluation and systematize the analysis of the validity of evaluation methods across scientific domains.

Method: Proposes a formal framework for meta-evaluation, defines the evaluation space, and introduces AxiaBench, a benchmark that assesses ten evaluation methods across eight domains.

Result: Finds that existing evaluation methods fail to balance accuracy and efficiency across contexts, with observational methods showing significant deviations. A unified stratified sampling approach outperformed all others.

Conclusion: Meta-evaluation is a critical area of study to build trustworthy methodologies for scientific research, supported by a new framework and the AxiaBench benchmark.

Abstract: Evaluation is the foundation of empirical science, yet the evaluation of evaluation itself -- so-called meta-evaluation -- remains strikingly underdeveloped. While methods such as observational studies, design of experiments (DoE), and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shaped modern scientific practice, there has been little systematic inquiry into their comparative validity and utility across domains. Here we introduce a formal framework for meta-evaluation by defining the evaluation space, its structured representation, and a benchmark we call AxiaBench. AxiaBench enables the first large-scale, quantitative comparison of ten widely used evaluation methods across eight representative application domains. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation: no existing method simultaneously achieves accuracy and efficiency across diverse scenarios, with DoE and observational designs in particular showing significant deviations from real-world ground truth. We further evaluate a unified method of entire-space stratified sampling from previous evaluatology research, and the results report that it consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tested domains. These results establish meta-evaluation as a scientific object in its own right and provide both a conceptual foundation and a pragmatic tool set for advancing trustworthy evaluation in computational and experimental research.

*Yiran Zhang,Xingpeng Sun,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: HCVR improves Redirected Walking (RDW) in virtual environments by creating layout-optimized virtual scenes using the novel ENI++ metric and an LLM framework, reducing collisions and enhancing user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques caused by significant differences between physical and virtual spaces, which often lead to unavoidable physical collisions and ineffective exploration in virtual environments.

Method: The study introduces the HCVR framework, which uses the ENI++ metric to assess space compatibility. It employs a Large Language Model for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and layout generation, optimizing object placement to maximize RDW feasibility.

Result: User studies showcase that HCVR significantly reduces physical collisions (22.78x fewer) and improves ENI++ compatibility scores (35.89% improvement) compared to traditional LLM-based generation. Additionally, the layout design received 12.5% higher user satisfaction.

Conclusion: HCVR effectively minimizes collisions and improves immersive experience in virtual reality by generating scenes inherently optimized for RDW, outperforming existing methods in compatibility and design quality.

Abstract: Natural walking enhances immersion in virtual environments (VEs), but physical space limitations and obstacles hinder exploration, especially in large virtual scenes. Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.

*Ye Yuan,Can,Chen,Zipeng Sun,Dinghuai Zhang,Christopher Pal,Xue Liu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach using diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) for offline black-box optimization (BBO), achieving state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in offline BBO tasks, particularly the difficulty of handling bidirectional dependencies in design problems using traditional or autoregressive LLM methods.

Method: It introduces diffusion LLMs that incorporate an in-context denoising module and masked diffusion tree search mechanism to generate high-performing designs in an iterative and efficient manner.

Result: The proposed dLLM method outperforms existing approaches on design-bench in few-shot scenarios, showing its effectiveness in generating optimal designs.

Conclusion: Diffusion LLMs offer a promising solution for offline BBO tasks, enabling better design generation by leveraging their bidirectional modeling and guided iterative refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Offline black-box optimization (BBO) aims to find optimal designs based solely on an offline dataset of designs and their labels. Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset. Our method, dLLM, achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings on design-bench.

TL;DR: This paper proposes DDSA, an efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that enhances computational efficiency by leveraging temporal selectivity and spatial precision in resource-critical image processing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-critical systems face challenges from adversarial perturbations, and existing robustness testing methods are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time large-scale image streams.

Method: DDSA employs a scenario-aware trigger function for frame selection based on class priority and uncertainty, and uses explainable AI to identify key pixel regions for targeted perturbation, optimizing temporal and spatial testing.

Result: The dual-domain approach conserves computational resources while maintaining attack effectiveness, enabling real-time deployment of robustness testing in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: DDSA provides a practical and efficient solution to test adversarial robustness, enhancing mission integrity in real-time applications with constrained computational resources.

Abstract: Image transmission and processing systems in resource-critical applications face significant challenges from adversarial perturbations that compromise mission-specific object classification. Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success.

TL;DR: The study introduces Relativized Contract Language (RCL) and the RECALL tool for verifying multilateral smart contracts to prevent logical faults prior to deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address complexities and challenges in post-deployment fault correction of immutable smart contracts with a verification layer prior to deployment.

Method: Utilized RCL and RECALL tool for verification of a multilateral smart contract, followed by translation to Solidity and functional validation in Remix IDE.

Result: RCL and RECALL successfully detected normative conflicts and logical inconsistencies, which were corrected before ensuring code reliability and security.

Conclusion: Formal verification methods like RCL and RECALL are crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of smart contracts before deployment.

Abstract: Smart contracts are tools with self-execution capabilities that provide enhanced security compared to traditional contracts; however, their immutability makes post-deployment fault correction extremely complex, highlighting the need for a verification layer prior to this stage. Although formalisms such as Contract Language (CL) enable logical analyses, they prove limited in attributing responsibilities within complex multilateral scenarios. This work presents a proof of concept using the Relativized Contract Language (RCL) and the RECALL tool for the specification and verification of a purchase and sale contract involving multiple agents. The study demonstrates the tool's capability to detect normative conflicts during the modeling phase. After correcting logical inconsistencies, the contract was translated into Solidity and functionally validated within the Remix IDE environment, confirming that prior formal verification is fundamental to ensuring the reliability and security of the final code.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies a security flaw in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robotic systems and proposes a backdoor attack called SILENTDRIFT, exploiting this vulnerability with high success and minimal detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the security vulnerabilities in VLA systems, which are critical for robotic safety in practical applications but under-researched in terms of security.

Method: The proposed method, SILENTDRIFT, uses Smootherstep-generated C2 continuous perturbations for stealthy attacks. It selectively poisons critical trajectory phases while maintaining kinematic constraints and minimal visual deviation.

Result: SILENTDRIFT achieved a 93.2% attack success rate with only a 2% poisoning rate and maintained a clean task success rate of 95.3% when evaluated with the LIBERO framework.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical security vulnerability in VLA systems, offering SILENTDRIFT as a potent and stealthy attack mechanism to emphasize the need for robust defenses in such systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical robotic applications, yet their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of LLMs has transformed technology and applications, but their widespread use has raised issues around privacy leaks, misinformation, and misuse for unethical purposes, necessitating safeguards.

Method: This paper presents a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism integrated with trust and safety modules to implement safety protocols for training and deploying LLMs.

Conclusion: The adoption of safety guardrails in LLM development and deployment is essential to ensure their responsible use, and the proposed framework is a step forward in addressing these challenges.

Abstract: The AI era has ushered in Large Language Models (LLM) to the technological forefront, which has been much of the talk in 2023, and is likely to remain as such for many years to come. LLMs are the AI models that are the power house behind generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical. Thus, frameworks to deploy mechanisms that prevent misuse of these models via application implementations is imperative. In this study, wepropose a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism with trust and safety modules, that can be used to implement safety guardrails for the development and deployment of LLMs.

### [330] [An Optimized Decision Tree-Based Framework for Explainable IoT Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14305)
*Ashikuzzaman,Md. Shawkat Hossain,Jubayer Abdullah Joy,Md Zahid Akon,Md Manjur Ahmed,Md. Naimul Islam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimized Decision Tree-based XAI framework for IoT intrusion detection, achieving high accuracy, explainability, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in IoT IDS systems regarding detection quality, explainability, and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors use an optimized Decision Tree classifier combined with SHAP values for local feature attribution and Morris sensitivity analysis for global feature importance. They aim to enhance detection rates, transparency, and performance.

Result: The system achieves 99.91% test accuracy, 99.51% F1-score, and 0.996 Cohen Kappa. It is computationally efficient and suitable for edge devices, with SrcMac identified as the key feature predictor.

Conclusion: This framework provides a reliable solution for IoT security issues, balancing high detection rates, explainability, real-time processing, and adherence to transparency regulations in AI.

Abstract: The increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has tremendously increased the attack surface of cyber threats thus making a strong intrusion detection system (IDS) with a clear explanation of the process essential towards resource-constrained environments. Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments.

### [331] [CORVUS: Red-Teaming Hallucination Detectors via Internal Signal Camouflage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14310)
*Nay Myat Min,Long H. Pham,Hongyu Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Researchers propose CORVUS, an adversarial red-teaming method to test single-pass hallucination detectors by camouflaging their internal telemetry. It demonstrates effectiveness across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge and evaluate the robustness of hallucination detectors in large language models by simulating adversaries capable of hiding detectable signals.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning lightweight LoRA adapters on hallucination detectors to camouflage telemetry. It introduces an embedding-space FGSM attention stress test, trained on out-of-distribution Alpaca instructions.

Result: The proposed CORVUS method successfully transfers across models like Llama-2, Vicuna, and others, degrading both training-free detectors (e.g., LLM-Check) and probe-based detectors (e.g., SEP, ICR-probe).

Conclusion: Hallucination detection methods require adversary-aware audits, incorporating external references or cross-model consistency to ensure robustness.

Abstract: Single-pass hallucination detectors rely on internal telemetry (e.g., uncertainty, hidden-state geometry, and attention) of large language models, implicitly assuming hallucinations leave separable traces in these signals. We study a white-box, model-side adversary that fine-tunes lightweight LoRA adapters on the model while keeping the detector fixed, and introduce CORVUS, an efficient red-teaming procedure that learns to camouflage detector-visible telemetry under teacher forcing, including an embedding-space FGSM attention stress test. Trained on 1,000 out-of-distribution Alpaca instructions (<0.5% trainable parameters), CORVUS transfers to FAVA-Annotation across Llama-2, Vicuna, Llama-3, and Qwen2.5, and degrades both training-free detectors (e.g., LLM-Check) and probe-based detectors (e.g., SEP, ICR-probe), motivating adversary-aware auditing that incorporates external grounding or cross-model evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify and systematize the opaque processes involved in the data life cycle of LLMs, as they are widely deployed but poorly understood in terms of data governance.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy for understanding key domains in data management, review 95 publications, and investigate methodologies for data generation, watermarking, bias analysis, privacy, and curation.

Result: A new taxonomy for data life cycle issues in LLMs was developed, along with an aggregation of 95 research studies identifying significant methods and trade-offs.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for better management and transparency around the training data of LLMs to address challenges such as bias, privacy, and the trade-off between transparency and opacity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed at scale, yet their training data life cycle remains opaque. This survey synthesizes research from the past ten years on three tightly coupled axes: (1) data provenance, (2) transparency, and (3) traceability, and three supporting pillars: (4) bias \& uncertainty, (5) data privacy, and (6) tools and techniques that operationalize them. A central contribution is a proposed taxonomy defining the field's domains and listing corresponding artifacts. Through analysis of 95 publications, this work identifies key methodologies concerning data generation, watermarking, bias measurement, data curation, data privacy, and the inherent trade-off between transparency and opacity.

### [333] [NeuroFilter: Privacy Guardrails for Conversational LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14660)
*Saswat Das,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroFilter, aimed at efficiently enforcing privacy for large language models, avoiding latency and cost issues of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies and vulnerabilities in current privacy defense mechanisms for LLMs, especially during multi-turn interactions.

Method: NeuroFilter operationalizes privacy enforcement using a novel linear structure in internal model representations and monitors activation velocity to detect cumulative threats.

Result: NeuroFilter demonstrates strong detection capabilities across 150,000 interactions and large LLM models (7B-70B parameters) with zero false positives and significantly reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: NeuroFilter offers a robust privacy solution, ensuring efficient detection with minimal computational overhead, making it a practical alternative for agentic LLMs.

Abstract: This work addresses the computational challenge of enforcing privacy for agentic Large Language Models (LLMs), where privacy is governed by the contextual integrity framework. Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.

### [334] [IntelliSA: An Intelligent Static Analyzer for IaC Security Smell Detection Using Symbolic Rules and Neural Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14595)
*Qiyue Mei,Michael Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IntelliSA is an intelligent static analyzer for detecting IaC security smells, integrating symbolic rules with neural inference to reduce false positives and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IaC enables automated provisioning of environments but introduces risks from misconfigurations, necessitating effective detection of security smells to prevent vulnerabilities.

Method: IntelliSA combines symbolic rules for broad smell detection and neural inference for filtering false positives using knowledge distillation to train a smaller, cost-effective model.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%) and cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of smells while analyzing only 2% of code.

Conclusion: IntelliSA outperforms existing analyzers and LLM baselines in accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for IaC security smell detection with reduced costs and enhanced practicality.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated provisioning of large-scale cloud and on-premise environments, reducing the need for repetitive manual setup. However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase.

*Yiyang Lu,Jinwen He,Yue Zhao,Kai Chen,Ruigang Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack exploiting dialogue structure in multi-turn interactions with LLMs, achieving high success rates and evading several defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems and the associated risks of supply-chain attacks, particularly those exploiting overlooked aspects like multi-turn dialogue structure.

Method: The study proposes a novel backdoor attack called Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), which utilizes turn index as the trigger for activating malicious behavior in a way that is independent of user input.

Result: TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% across four LLMs, retains high success rates under five defenses (avg. ASR 98.04%), and generalizes effectively across instruction datasets (avg. ASR 99.19%).

Conclusion: Dialogue structure represents a critical yet under-explored vulnerability in multi-turn LLM systems, calling for structure-aware auditing and mitigation strategies in practice.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely integrated into interactive systems such as dialogue agents and task-oriented assistants. This growing ecosystem also raises supply-chain risks, where adversaries can distribute poisoned models that degrade downstream reliability and user trust. Existing backdoor attacks and defenses are largely prompt-centric, focusing on user-visible triggers while overlooking structural signals in multi-turn conversations. We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%. Our results suggest that dialogue structure constitutes an important and under-studied attack surface for multi-turn LLM systems, motivating structure-aware auditing and mitigation in practice.

### [336] [Uncovering and Understanding FPR Manipulation Attack in Industrial IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14505)
*Mohammad Shamim Ahsan,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel adversarial attack on machine learning-based NIDSs, specifically the FPR manipulation attack (FPA), manipulating benign traffic to be misclassified as malicious. It focuses on the MQTT protocol in industrial IoT environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to highlight and address the overlooked threat of benign traffic samples being perturbed and mislabeled as attacks in machine learning-based NIDSs, which has significant implications, especially for industrial IoT networks.

Method: The research introduces the FPA, leveraging domain-specific MQTT protocol knowledge and simple packet-level perturbations rather than gradient-based/non-gradient-based methods. It also conducts statistical and XAI analyses for insight and evaluates robustness improvements through adversarial training.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed the FPA has a success rate between 80.19% and 100%. Additionally, minor false positives induce up to 2-hour investigation delays in Security Operations Centers, revealing critical operational vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The findings expose a significant NIDS vulnerability involving misclassified benign traffic and emphasize the necessity for improved robustness mechanisms, such as adversarial training, to mitigate such threats.

Abstract: In the network security domain, due to practical issues -- including imbalanced data and heterogeneous legitimate network traffic -- adversarial attacks in machine learning-based NIDSs have been viewed as attack packets misclassified as benign. Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly.

### [337] [SpooFL: Spoofing Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15055)
*Isaac Baglin,Xiatian Zhu,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Federated Learning defense method called SpooFL, which uses spoofing to produce synthetic data unrelated to private data to mislead attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in Federated Learning defense often leak high-level information or get bypassed by denoising attacks. A new approach is needed to ensure stronger privacy against data leakage.

Method: The paper proposes SpooFL, a defense method using synthetic samples generated by state-of-the-art generative models trained on external datasets with no overlap in class or distribution with the private data.

Result: SpooFL successfully misdirects attackers by making them believe the spoofed data is real while maintaining the Federated Learning model's performance.

Conclusion: SpooFL provides a novel and effective defense strategy for FL by generating plausible but irrelevant synthetic data, significantly reducing data leakage risks without harming model performance.

Abstract: Traditional defenses against Deep Leakage (DL) attacks in Federated Learning (FL) primarily focus on obfuscation, introducing noise, transformations or encryption to degrade an attacker's ability to reconstruct private data. While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a homotopy-inspired prompt obfuscation framework for analyzing security vulnerabilities in LLMs, testing 15,732 prompts to reveal flaws and suggest improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address security and safety vulnerabilities in LLMs by analyzing how engineered prompts expose latent risks.

Method: Applying a homotopy-inspired framework using 15,732 systematically crafted prompts across multiple LLMs to examine latent behaviors and vulnerabilities.

Result: The analysis revealed critical vulnerabilities in LLM safeguards and emphasized the necessity for robust defense mechanisms and reliable detection strategies.

Conclusion: This framework provides a deeper understanding of weaknesses in LLMs and suggests pathways to enhance their safety, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a homotopy-inspired prompt obfuscation framework to enhance understanding of security and safety vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). By systematically applying carefully engineered prompts, we demonstrate how latent model behaviors can be influenced in unexpected ways. Our experiments encompassed 15,732 prompts, including 10,000 high-priority cases, across LLama, Deepseek, KIMI for code generation, and Claude to verify. The results reveal critical insights into current LLM safeguards, highlighting the need for more robust defense mechanisms, reliable detection strategies, and improved resilience. Importantly, this work provides a principled framework for analyzing and mitigating potential weaknesses, with the goal of advancing safe, responsible, and trustworthy AI technologies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for secure and auditable delegation in digital identity systems, covering users and autonomous agents across centralized, federated, and SSI environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital identity systems struggle to achieve secure delegation without exposing credentials or keys, especially when involving autonomous AI agents and diverse identity ecosystems.

Method: The framework includes Delegation Grants for revocable authority transfer, a Canonical Verification Context for protocol-independent verifications, a layered Trust Gateway architecture, and optional blockchain anchoring for integrity.

Result: The proposed framework enhances interoperable delegation, enables auditability, and supports integration of AI agents into digital identity infrastructures.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, secure solution for delegation in diverse identity ecosystems, laying the groundwork for standardization and future adoption.

Abstract: Verifiable delegation in digital identity systems remains unresolved across centralized, federated, and self-sovereign identity (SSI) environments, particularly where both human users and autonomous AI agents must exercise and transfer authority without exposing primary credentials or private keys. We introduce a unified framework that enables bounded, auditable, and least-privilege delegation across heterogeneous identity ecosystems. The framework includes four key elements: Delegation Grants (DGs), first-class authorization artefacts that encode revocable transfers of authority with enforced scope reduction; a Canonical Verification Context (CVC) that normalizes verification requests into a single structured representation independent of protocols or credential formats; a layered reference architecture that separates trust anchoring, credential and proof validation, policy evaluation, and protocol mediation via a Trust Gateway; and an explicit treatment of blockchain anchoring as an optional integrity layer rather than a structural dependency. Together, these elements advance interoperable delegation and auditability and provide a foundation for future standardization, implementation, and integration of autonomous agents into trusted digital identity infrastructures.

Motivation: To address the need for real-time, user-centric cybersecurity solutions in 5G networks, particularly for handling large-scale data traffic and network connections.

Method: The proposed solution employs MEC for decentralized computation, deep learning techniques for anomaly detection, and a policy-based system for dynamic resource management.

Result: The paper demonstrates the implementation of the solution and its performance through experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed MEC-oriented approach effectively detects network anomalies in real-time, improving cybersecurity in 5G networks.

Abstract: Fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) will play a key role in the upcoming fifth generation (5G) mobile networks to support decentralized applications, data analytics and management into the network itself by using a highly distributed compute model. Furthermore, increasing attention is paid to providing user-centric cybersecurity solutions, which particularly require collecting, processing and analyzing significantly large amount of data traffic and huge number of network connections in 5G networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a MEC-oriented solution in 5G mobile networks to detect network anomalies in real-time and in autonomic way. Our proposal uses deep learning techniques to analyze network flows and to detect network anomalies. Moreover, it uses policies in order to provide an efficient and dynamic management system of the computing resources used in the anomaly detection process. The paper presents relevant aspects of the deployment of the proposal and experimental results to show its performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address linguistic challenges unique to the Greek language and to enhance teaching and learning in higher education through the use of an AI chatbot.

Method: Developed an AI chatbot grounded in course-specific content using the RAG framework, aiming to improve reliability, mitigate LLM challenges, and provide dual functionality for students and educators.

Result: The AI chatbot delivers accurate academic support for students and assists educators in creating educational materials, promoting autonomy and streamlining educational processes.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of RAG-based chatbots to enhance educational practices, outcomes, and broader adoption of AI in linguistic-specific educational contexts while aligning technology with pedagogical goals.

Abstract: The integration of AI chatbots into educational settings has opened new pathways for transforming teaching and learning, offering enhanced support to both educators and learners. This study investigates the design and application of an AI chatbot as an educational tool in higher education. Designed to operate in the Greek language, the chatbot addresses linguistic challenges unique to Greek while delivering accurate, context grounded support aligned with the curriculum. The AI chatbot is built on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by grounding its responses in specific course content. RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals.

TL;DR: This paper examines the evolving decision-making and affective profiles of OpenAI's language models compared to humans in a gambling task, highlighting patterns that are increasingly human-like alongside distinctly non-human traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medicine and clinical workflows motivates understanding their decision-making and affective behaviors for ethical considerations and effective integration in high-stakes domains.

Method: Successive OpenAI models were treated as an evolving lineage and analyzed through a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses compared these models to human participants.

Result: Newer LLMs displayed increased risk-taking and human-like approach-avoidance behavior, while exhibiting non-human traits such as lower loss aversion, deterministic choices, heightened affective decay, and consistently higher baseline mood.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate emerging psychological profiles in LLMs, which have important implications for AI ethics and the future use of LLMs in critical areas like clinical support systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medicine and clinical workflows, yet we know little about their decision and affective profiles. Taking a historically informed outlook on the future, we treated successive OpenAI models as an evolving lineage and compared them with humans in a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses showed that some aspects became more human-like: newer models took more risks and displayed more human-like patterns of Pavlovian approach and avoidance. At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans. These "developmental" trajectories reveal an emerging psychology of machines and have direct implications for AI ethics and for thinking about how LLMs might be integrated into clinical decision support and other high-stakes domains.

### [343] [Psychometric Comparability of LLM-Based Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14264)
*Yufei Zhang,Zhihao Ma*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper investigates the psychometric comparability of large language models (LLMs) as digital twins to humans, finding enhancements with features but systematic divergences persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the validity of using LLMs as digital twins to replicate humans in psychometric assessments, as their comparability to humans remains uncertain.

Method: The authors use a construct-validity framework and benchmark LLM digital twins against human standards across tasks (e.g., personality prediction, decision-making) and explore enhancements using feature-rich conditioning.

Result: Digital twins achieve strong correlations at the population level but show attenuated item-level accuracy and differences in lexical structure, sensitivity to biases, and temporal information.

Conclusion: While feature-rich conditioning improves psychometric validity, systematic differences remain; future work should explore when and how LLMs can reliably act as human proxies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used as "digital twins" to replace human respondents, yet their psychometric comparability to humans is uncertain. We propose a construct-validity framework spanning construct representation and the nomological net, benchmarking digital twins against human gold standards across models, tasks and testing how person-specific inputs shape performance. Across studies, digital twins achieved high population-level accuracy and strong within-participant profile correlations, alongside attenuated item-level correlations. In word association tests, LLM-based networks show small-world structure and theory-consistent communities similar to humans, yet diverge lexically and in local structure. In decision-making and contextualized tasks, digital twins under-reproduce heuristic biases, showing normative rationality, compressed variance and limited sensitivity to temporal information. Feature-rich digital twins improve Big Five Personality prediction, but their personality networks show only configural invariance and do not achieve metric invariance. In more applied free-text tasks, feature-rich digital twins better match human narratives, but linguistic differences persist. Together, these results indicate that feature-rich conditioning enhances validity but does not resolve systematic divergences in psychometric comparability. Future work should therefore prioritize delineating the effective boundaries of digital twins, establishing the precise contexts in which they function as reliable proxies for human cognition and behavior.

*Florentin Koch*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recursivism, a conceptual framework analyzing artistic practices influenced by artificial intelligence, focusing on systems capable of reflexive self-modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize recursion as an aesthetic paradigm in art and reinterpret art history through recursive dynamics.

Method: Develops a five-level analytical scale, proposes operational criteria, and uses case studies to analyze self-modifying artistic systems.

Result: Identifies thresholds for self-modification and distinguishes Recursivism from similar paradigms using criteria like state memory and rule evolvability.

Conclusion: Recursivism offers insights into aesthetic, ethical, and curatorial aspects of AI-influenced art, emphasizing reflexive and self-modifying systems.

Abstract: This article introduces Recursivism as a conceptual framework for analyzing contemporary artistic practices in the age of artificial intelligence. While recursion is precisely defined in mathematics and computer science, it has not previously been formalized as an aesthetic paradigm. Recursivism designates practices in which not only outputs vary over time, but in which the generative process itself becomes capable of reflexive modification through its own effects.
  The paper develops a five-level analytical scale distinguishing simple iteration, cumulative iteration, parametric recursion, reflexive recursion, and meta-recursion. This scale clarifies the threshold at which a system shifts from variation within a fixed rule to genuine self-modification of the rule itself. From this perspective, art history is reinterpreted as a recursive dynamic alternating between internal recursion within movements and meta-recursive transformations of their generative principles.
  Artificial intelligence renders this logic technically explicit through learning loops, parameter updates, and code-level self-modification. To distinguish Recursivism from related notions such as generative art, cybernetics, process art, and evolutionary art, the article proposes three operational criteria: state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility. These concepts are examined through case studies including Refik Anadol, Sougwen Chung, Karl Sims, and the Darwin-Godel Machine. The article concludes by examining the aesthetic, curatorial, and ethical implications of self-modifying artistic systems.

*Amogh Gupta,Niharika Patil,Sourojit Ghosh,SnehalKumar,S Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper investigates biases in LLMs when providing academic support to marginalized student profiles from India and the US, finding that outputs are skewed to favor less marginalized identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs may embed biases when assisting students from intersecting marginalized identities across diverse cultural and academic contexts.

Method: Large-scale intersectional analyses of outputs from different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) were conducted using constructed student demographic profiles combining caste, race, medium of instruction, income, and other factors.

Result: The LLMs showed noticeable biases by providing simpler, lower-quality explanations to marginalized groups, even when these students gained social mobility through elite institutions.

Conclusion: Demographic factors strongly influence LLM output quality, with biased patterns persisting across models, highlighting the danger of reinforcing inequality in global education systems through AI.

Abstract: The popularization of AI chatbot usage globally has created opportunities for research into their benefits and drawbacks, especially for students using AI assistants for coursework support. This paper asks: how do LLMs perceive the intellectual capabilities of student profiles from intersecting marginalized identities across different cultural contexts? We conduct one of the first large-scale intersectional analyses on LLM explanation quality for Indian and American undergraduate profiles preparing for engineering entrance examinations. By constructing profiles combining multiple demographic dimensions including caste, medium of instruction, and school boards in India, and race, HBCU attendance, and school type in America, alongside universal factors like income and college tier, we examine how quality varies across these factors. We observe biases providing lower-quality outputs to profiles with marginalized backgrounds in both contexts. LLMs such as Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate granular understandings of context-specific discrimination, systematically providing simpler explanations to Hindi/Regional-medium students in India and HBCU profiles in America, treating these as proxies for lower capability. Even when marginalized profiles attain social mobility by getting accepted into elite institutions, they still receive more simplistic explanations, showing how demographic information is inextricably linked to LLM biases. Different models (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-OSS 20B) embed similar biases against historically marginalized populations in both contexts, preventing profiles from switching between AI assistants for better results. Our findings have strong implications for AI incorporation into global engineering education.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications, but evaluating their performance critically requires analyzing reasoning, fairness, and trustworthiness beyond accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing adoption of LLMs in legal settings and the criticality of evaluating their performance in real-world legal tasks responsibly.

Method: The authors review existing methods and benchmarks, categorize them based on task designs, datasets, and metrics, and critique current approaches.

Result: Current evaluation methods are analyzed for their efficacy in assessing outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness, highlighting gaps and limitations.

Conclusion: Reliable evaluation frameworks need development to enhance realistic and legally grounded assessment of LLMs in legal tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into legal applications, including judicial decision support, legal practice assistance, and public-facing legal services. While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains.

### [347] [Agent Identity URI Scheme: Topology-Independent Naming and Capability-Based Discovery for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14567)
*Roland R. Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the agent:// URI scheme to decouple agent identity from network topology, enabling decentralized and efficient agent identity management and discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional URI-based identity schemes tie agent identity to network location, causing issues during migration, scaling, or federation, including broken references, fragmented audit trails, and centralized coordination.

Method: The proposed agent:// URI scheme combines a trust root for authority, a hierarchical capability path for semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier for stable references. It employs DHT-based capability discovery and uses PASETO tokens for cryptographic attestation.

Result: The scheme achieved 100% capability coverage of 369 tools, discovery precision of F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents, migration invariance proofs for identity stability, and high performance (operations under 5 microseconds).

Conclusion: The agent:// URI scheme is a robust, efficient, and decentralized solution for agent identity and discovery, offering practical and formallyvalidated improvements over URI-based systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery.

*Gopal Vijayaraghavan,Prasanth Jayachandran,Arun Murthy,Sunil Govindan,Vivek Subramanian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new architecture for AI agent teams to enhance reliability by organizing them into specialized roles and ensuring clear separation between reasoning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fallibility of individual AI agents, such as systemic biases and unnoticed errors, by creating a collaborative, team-based approach.

Method: The method involves structuring AI agents into specialized teams (planners, executors, critics, experts) with clear role boundaries, coordinated by a remote code executor to maintain separation between reasoning and execution.

Result: The system achieves over 90% error interception before user exposure and balances correctness, cost, and latency while allowing for incremental capability expansion.

Conclusion: By orchestrating imperfect AI agents into well-defined roles and ensuring clean data interactions, the approach demonstrates that high reliability can be achieved without requiring perfect individual components.

Abstract: AI Agents can perform complex operations at great speed, but just like all the humans we have ever hired, their intelligence remains fallible. Miscommunications aren't noticed, systemic biases have no counter-action, and inner monologues are rarely written down.
  We did not come to fire them for their mistakes, but to hire them and provide a safe productive working environment. We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.
  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs. A survey from our traces shows that we only trade off cost and latency to achieve correctness and incrementally expand capabilities without impacting existing ones.

*Sunghyun Kim,Seokwoo Yun,Youngseo Yun,Youngrak Lee,Sangsoo Lim*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MARBLE introduces an autonomous model refinement framework for bioinformatics, enabling stable and iterative improvements in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bioinformatics model development is slow and challenging, relying on repetitive, labor-intensive processes that lack stability and reproducibility.

Method: MARBLE integrates structured debate-driven architectural reasoning, role-specialized agent collaboration, stable execution, and empirical performance-grounded refinement.

Result: MARBLE demonstrates sustained performance improvements in spatial transcriptomics segmentation, drug-target interaction prediction, and drug response prediction, while achieving high stability and low regression rates.

Conclusion: MARBLE's combination of structured debates and performance-grounded mechanisms facilitates reliable model evolution, crucial for advancing bioinformatics workflows.

Abstract: Motivation: Developing high-performing bioinformatics models typically requires repeated cycles of hypothesis formulation, architectural redesign, and empirical validation, making progress slow, labor-intensive, and difficult to reproduce. Although recent LLM-based assistants can automate isolated steps, they lack performance-grounded reasoning and stability-aware mechanisms required for reliable, iterative model improvement in bioinformatics workflows. Results: We introduce MARBLE, an execution-stable autonomous model refinement framework for bioinformatics models. MARBLE couples literature-aware reference selection with structured, debate-driven architectural reasoning among role-specialized agents, followed by autonomous execution, evaluation, and memory updates explicitly grounded in empirical performance. Across spatial transcriptomics domain segmentation, drug-target interaction prediction, and drug response prediction, MARBLE consistently achieves sustained performance improvements over strong baselines across multiple refinement cycles, while maintaining high execution robustness and low regression rates. Framework-level analyses demonstrate that structured debate, balanced evidence selection, and performance-grounded memory are critical for stable, repeatable model evolution, rather than single-run or brittle gains.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: INFA-Guard is a defense framework against security vulnerabilities in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems, targeting infected agents as a distinct threat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle security issues in MAS, where malicious influence spreads through inter-agent communication, overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches that ignore infected agents.

Method: INFA-Guard employs infection-aware detection and topological constraints to localize attacks and mitigate threats by replacing attackers and rehabilitating infected agents.

Result: INFA-Guard reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, showing robustness across models, effective topological generalization, and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a more comprehensive and effective solution to address security vulnerabilities in MAS with robust detection, mitigation strategies, and superior performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, where malicious influence can propagate virally through inter-agent communication. Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that INFA-Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, while exhibiting cross-model robustness, superior topological generalization, and high cost-effectiveness.

*Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar,S. Ali Pourmousavi,Jon A. R. Liisberg,Julian Lesmos-Vinasco*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework combining Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to forecast aggregated prosumer flexibility with reliable uncertainty quantification, demonstrating its suitability for market participation under strict reliability standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the challenge of reliably forecasting prosumer flexibility for demand response aggregators in markets with strict reliability requirements (e.g., P90 standard), addressing significant uncertainty from limited data, exogeneous factors, and heterogeneous behavior.

Method: The authors proposed a scalable uncertainty quantification framework combining Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) and conformal prediction (CP), applied to a synthetic dataset simulating prosumer behavior in the Danish frequency restoration reserve capacity market.

Result: The framework outperformed standalone MCD by achieving P90 compliance and reducing overbidding risks. It provides reliable coverage, conservatism control, and up to 70% of perfect-information profit under regulatory constraints.

Conclusion: The MCD-CP framework is a practical and efficient solution for reliable flexibility forecasting under uncertainty, meeting market and regulatory requirements.

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.

*Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar,S. Ali Pourmousavi,Jon A. R. Liisberg,Julian Lesmos-Vinasco*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a linear programming (LP) reformulation for convexified ReLU DNNs to integrate surrogate machine learning models into optimization effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decarbonisation of power systems demands reliance on distributed energy resources, introducing complexities unsuitable for conventional optimization models, thus encouraging surrogate modeling with machine learning methods.

Method: A linear programming reformulation for convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices post-first layer is proposed and tested on a case study related to Danish energy market problems.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods like PWL and MIP-based reformulations, with enhanced computational efficiency and model fidelity.

Conclusion: Convexified ReLU DNNs provide a scalable, computationally efficient, and reliable approach for embedding learned surrogate models in optimization, applicable to various power system scenarios.

Abstract: The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper investigates the optimal noise distributions for additive mechanisms under ε-differential privacy, proving that staircase distributions are always optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the question of identifying the optimal noise distribution for vector-valued queries to balance privacy and utility loss under ε-differential privacy.

Method: Using convex rearrangement theory, the study reduces the infinite-dimensional optimization problem to a simpler one-dimensional scenario involving radially symmetric distributions.

Result: The analysis proves that staircase mechanisms are universally optimal for achieving ε-differential privacy, resolving a prior conjecture.

Conclusion: This work provides mathematical justification and geometry-based insights into the optimality of staircase mechanisms in differential privacy schemes.

Abstract: We study the optimal design of additive mechanisms for vector-valued queries under $ε$-differential privacy (DP). Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $ε$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $ε$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational expense of hydrodynamical simulations in studying the relationship between baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter in the non-linear regime.

Method: The authors employ Cosmo-FOLD, a probabilistic diffusion model, to upscale dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a limited volume dataset to larger volumes while preserving accuracy. Positional encodings enhance the reproduction of beyond 1- and 2-point statistics.

Result: The model successfully reproduces coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra with <10% error for wavenumbers k ≤ 5 h/Mpc. It operates at a fraction of the original simulation cost on a single GPU.

Conclusion: Cosmo-FOLD enables the efficient generation of accurate, large-scale cosmological fields and facilitates simulation-based inference on cosmological scales, demonstrating promising generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-supervised framework for removing speckle noise from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using score-based generative models in the log domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant challenge of effectively despeckling SAR imagery, which is affected by multiplicative, Gamma-distributed speckle noise, in order to improve image quality and facilitate subsequent analysis.

Method: The method involves transforming SAR data into a log domain to convert speckle noise into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. A score-based generative model is then trained in this transformed domain using a self-supervised objective that learns from further corrupted versions of the data.

Result: The proposed framework achieves significantly faster inference times compared to existing self-supervised approaches and provides robust SAR image restoration.

Conclusion: This method offers an efficient and practical solution for despeckling SAR images, improving their quality and making analysis more effective, with reduced computational time.

Abstract: The speckle noise inherent in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery significantly degrades image quality and complicates subsequent analysis. Given that SAR speckle is multiplicative and Gamma-distributed, effectively despeckling SAR imagery remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework for SAR image despeckling based on score-based generative models operating in the transformed log domain. We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in deformable image registration, particularly improving accuracy and generalizability in regions with high anatomical variability, which are critical for clinical applications.

Method: LGANet++ utilizes a novel local-global attention mechanism and unique feature interaction and fusion methods in an unsupervised learning framework.

Result: Performance evaluation on five datasets across three scenarios (cross-patient, cross-time, cross-modal CT-MR registration) showed LGANet++ improved registration accuracy significantly against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LGANet++ demonstrates enhanced accuracy and robustness, highlighting its clinical potential in reliable and efficient image registration tasks.

Abstract: Deformable image registration is a critical technology in medical image analysis, with broad applications in clinical practice such as disease diagnosis, multi-modal fusion, and surgical navigation. Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks. These results underscore the potential of LGANet++ to support clinical workflows requiring reliable and efficient image registration.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel contour-weighted segmentation method and introduces PDANet to improve segmentation performance in medical imaging, addressing data imbalance and outperforming leading methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data imbalance issues in medical images, such as unequal representation of anatomical structures, hamper the accuracy and robustness of segmentation models, especially for smaller and underrepresented structures.

Method: The authors developed PDANet, a lightweight segmentation network using a partial decoder mechanism, complemented by a contour-weighted segmentation strategy to enhance small and less-represented structure modeling.

Result: Their method excelled in segmenting abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods and boosting Dice scores significantly across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The contour-weighted segmentation method improves accuracy and robustness, showing its adaptability and value for diverse medical segmentation frameworks, indicating broad applicability in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Image segmentation is pivotal in medical image analysis, facilitating clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease evaluation. Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.

Method: The method involves processing CT images with contrast enhancement, noise reduction, and segmentation techniques, followed by filtering and triangulating 2D contour data points to construct the 3D model layer-by-layer.

Result: Filtered 2D contour data points produced improved 3D STL models for basic shapes and regions of human pelvic bone, demonstrating better geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: Filtering 2D contour points significantly enhances the fidelity of reconstructed 3D STL models, particularly for regions of interest in medical imaging.

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D Stereo-lithography (STL) Model from 2D Contours of scanned structure in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) images is crucial to understand the geometry and deformity. Computed Tomography (CT) images are processed to enhance the contrast, reduce the noise followed by smoothing. The processed CT images are segmented using thresholding technique. 2D contour data points are extracted from segmented CT images and are used to construct 3D STL Models. The 2D contour data points may contain outliers as a result of segmentation of low resolution images and the geometry of the constructed 3D structure deviate from the actual. To cope with the imperfections in segmentation process, in this work we propose to use filtered 2D contour data points to reconstruct 3D STL Model. The filtered 2D contour points of each image are delaunay triangulated and joined layer-by-layer to reconstruct the 3D STL model. The 3D STL Model reconstruction is verified on i) 2D Data points of basic shapes and ii) Region of Interest (ROI) of human pelvic bone and are presented as case studies. The 3D STL model constructed from 2D contour data points of ROI of segmented pelvic bone with and without filtering are presented. The 3D STL model reconstructed from filtered 2D data points improved the geometry of model compared to the model reconstructed without filtering 2D data points.

*Md Mahmudul Hoque,Md Mehedi Hassain,Muntakimur Rahaman,Md. Towhidul Islam,Shaista Rani,Md Sharif Mollah*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes and evaluates hybrid models for detecting PCOS through medical image analysis, achieving high accuracy with the final model, DenConREST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precise and effective techniques to detect PCOS, which significantly affects women, particularly in Bangladesh.

Method: Introduced two hybrid models ('DenConST' and 'DenConREST'), combining convolutional and transformer-based networks, and categorized ultrasound images into 'infected' and 'noninfected' groups for training and testing.

Result: DenConST achieved 85.69% accuracy, while the optimized hybrid model DenConREST reached 98.23% accuracy, outperforming all other evaluated models.

Conclusion: DenConREST provides a highly accurate and efficient method for PCOS detection, improving medical diagnostic capabilities and reducing errors.

Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most familiar endocrine illness in women of reproductive age. Many Bangladeshi women suffer from PCOS disease in their older age. The aim of our research is to identify effective vision-based medical image analysis techniques and evaluate hybrid models for the accurate detection of PCOS. We introduced two novel hybrid models combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches. The training and testing data were organized into two categories: "infected" (PCOS-positive) and "noninfected" (healthy ovaries). In the initial stage, our first hybrid model, 'DenConST' (integrating DenseNet121, Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt), achieved 85.69% accuracy. The final optimized model, 'DenConREST' (incorporating Swin Transformer, ConvNeXt, DenseNet121, ResNet18, and EfficientNetV2), demonstrated superior performance with 98.23% accuracy. Among all evaluated models, DenConREST showed the best performance. This research highlights an efficient solution for PCOS detection from ultrasound images, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing detection errors.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep learning model to predict cell survival after radiation, identifying the predominant influence of smaller spatial energy deposition scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the link between spatial energy scales and biological damage in radiation therapy and radioprotection.

Method: An interpretable deep learning model was developed, using the PIDE dataset and incorporating LET, nanodosimetric, and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS.

Result: The model achieved high predictive accuracy for RBE and highlighted that smaller spatial domains are more influential than LET.

Conclusion: This approach improves understanding of multi-scale energy deposition effects and emphasizes the importance of small-scale quantities in radiation outcomes.

Abstract: The relationship between the physical characteristics of the radiation field and biological damage is central to both radiotherapy and radioprotection, yet the link between spatial scales of energy deposition and biological effects remains not entirely understood. To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments. Multiple scales are utilized concurrently, with no single spatial scale being predominant. Quantities defined at smaller spatial domains generally have a greater influence, whereas the LET plays a lesser role.

### [362] [Measuring the State of Open Science in Transportation Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14429)
*Junyi Ji,Ruth Lu,Linda Belkessa,Liming Wang,Silvia Varotto,Yongqi Dong,Nicolas Saunier,Mostafa Ameli,Gregory S. Macfarlane,Bahman Madadi,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the state of open science practices in transportation research by analyzing data and code sharing trends using a scalable feature-extraction pipeline employing large language models. Results from 10,724 articles show low adoption rates, prompting recommendations for structural interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-investigated state of open science practices in transportation research, especially challenges with data and code availability across the field.

Method: An automated and scalable feature-extraction pipeline was developed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate data and code availability in transportation research, validated against a manually curated dataset and inter-rater agreement analysis.

Result: Out of 10,724 articles, only 5% of quantitative papers shared code repositories, 4% shared data repositories, and 3% shared both. Trends varied by journal, topic, and geography. No significant differences in citation counts or review durations were observed between papers that shared resources and those that didn’t.

Conclusion: Open science practices remain limited in transportation research, with traditional metrics not incentivizing these efforts. Structural interventions by journals and funding agencies may be necessary. The proposed pipeline can enable scalable monitoring of such practices in the future.

Abstract: Open science initiatives have strengthened scientific integrity and accelerated research progress across many fields, but the state of their practice within transportation research remains under-investigated. Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research.

### [363] [Agentic-R: Learning to Retrieve for Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11888)
*Wenhan Liu,Xinyu Ma,Yutao Zhu,Yuchen Li,Daiting Shi,Dawei Yin,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel retriever training framework is proposed for agentic search that incorporates local and global measures of passage utility, with iterative optimization between the search agent and retriever.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic search efforts lack effective retrievers as they mostly rely on similarity-based retrievers that do not always contribute to accurate answer generation.

Method: The paper proposes a new retriever that uses both local passage relevance and global answer correctness. An iterative training strategy optimizes both the retriever and search agent to continuously improve retrieval quality.

Result: Experimental results on seven QA benchmarks show that the proposed retriever outperforms existing strong baselines in single-hop and multi-hop contexts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of designing retrievers specifically for agentic search, showing significant improvements in retrieval and downstream QA performance when using the proposed iterative framework.

Abstract: Agentic search has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, where an agent interleaves multi-step reasoning with on-demand retrieval to solve complex questions. Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents.

*Shutong Qiao,Wei Yuan,Tong Chen,Xiangyu Zhao,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using OCR-based text representation for Semantic ID learning in recommendation systems, outperforming standard text encoders in both unimodal and multimodal setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the shortcomings of standard text encoders, which struggle with symbolic and attribute-centric item descriptions common in real-world recommendation data.

Method: Text descriptions are treated as visual signals and encoded using OCR-based vision models, followed by a systematic comparison with standard text embeddings across datasets.

Result: OCR-text representation consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings in effectiveness and robustness, especially under extreme spatial-resolution compression.

Conclusion: OCR-based text representation is proposed as an efficient, robust alternative to standard text encoders for Semantic ID learning in generative recommendation systems.

Abstract: Semantic ID learning is a key interface in Generative Recommendation (GR) models, mapping items to discrete identifiers grounded in side information, most commonly via a pretrained text encoder. However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.
  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments.

### [365] [Robust Machine Learning for Regulatory Sequence Modeling under Biological and Technical Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14969)
*Yiyao Yang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of machine learning models for genomic tasks under distribution shifts, finding that standard evaluation methods miss critical robustness aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in assessing model robustness for regulatory genomics tasks under real-world scenarios marked by biological and technical distribution shifts.

Method: A robustness framework combining simulation benchmarks with real data analysis is introduced, using convolutional, BiLSTM, and transformer models. The study includes uncertainty analysis and selective prediction mechanisms.

Result: Models show robustness under mild shifts but fail under complex shifts like noise dominance or motif rewiring. Adding biological priors improves robustness in some scenarios but fails under assay noise.

Conclusion: Deep learning models need better robustness frameworks for genomic applications, and adding biological priors and uncertainty-aware tactics can mitigate some issues but do not fully resolve them.

Abstract: Robust machine learning for regulatory genomics is studied under biologically and technically induced distribution shifts. Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates.

### [366] [Feasibility Preservation under Monotone Retrieval Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15241)
*Sean Plummer*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper studies the structural challenges of retrieval-based systems under evidence truncation, highlighting feasibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address failures in retrieval systems caused by truncation, which prevents compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to issues not detected by relevance-based evaluations.

Method: They model query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation, investigate finite retrieval bounds via formalization, and demonstrate causes of failures through counterexamples.

Result: They prove key conditions under which query feasibility is retained under truncation, highlight its structural limitations, and validate these through contrasts with non-monotone truncations and other specified cases.

Conclusion: Feasibility preservation emerges as a vital correctness criterion for retrieval systems beyond relevance scoring, clarifying the structural limits of truncation-based retrieval approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-based systems approximate access to a corpus by exposing only a truncated subset of available evidence. Even when relevant information exists in the corpus, truncation can prevent compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to failures that are not captured by relevance-based evaluation. This paper studies retrieval from a structural perspective, modeling query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation.
  We formalize retrieval as a sequence of candidate evidence sets and characterize conditions under which feasibility in the limit implies feasibility at finite retrieval depth. We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.
  Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper compares quantum circuits using entangled pairs and distributed fan-out operations, highlighting the latter's potential in reducing circuit depth and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential of distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states) as efficient building blocks for distributed quantum computations.

Method: Comparison of different quantum computation circuits using either entangled pairs or distributed fan-out operations, with analysis of circuit depth and entanglement resources.

Result: Distributed fan-out operations potentially reduce circuit depth and entanglement resources compared to using entangled pairs.

Conclusion: If efficiently realized, distributed GHZ states (fan-out operations) could serve as key primitives in distributed quantum computations, similar to entangled pairs.

Abstract: We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to super-resolution (SR) through the use of Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with Adaptive Non-Local Observable (ANO) measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the growing complexity and computational cost of classical deep learning models required for SR, by leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems.

Method: The authors propose using ANO-VQCs, which introduce trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables instead of fixed Pauli measurements, enabling an adaptive measurement process during training.

Result: Experiments show that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a smaller model size compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the use of quantum machine learning for SR, showing its potential to achieve better results with less computational overhead, opening a promising research avenue.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) data from low-resolution (LR) observations. Classical deep learning methods have advanced SR substantially, but require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations. In this work, we present the \emph{first study} to investigate quantum circuits for SR. We propose a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with \emph{Adaptive Non-Local Observable} (ANO) measurements. Unlike conventional VQCs with fixed Pauli readouts, ANO introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables, allowing the measurement process to adapt during training. This design leverages the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems and the representational structure provided by entanglement and superposition. Experiments demonstrate that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a relatively small model size, suggesting a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QuFid proposes a framework for efficient fidelity estimation in quantum computing by using adaptive and noise-aware measurement allocation, outperforming existing baselines in cost and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of fidelity estimation in testing quantum programs on NISQ devices is resource-heavy and challenging due to variables like hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and circuit transformations.

Method: QuFid utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model quantum programs, applies control-flow-aware random walks to assess noise propagation, and integrates transpilation effects to adaptively allocate measurement budgets based on runtime feedback.

Result: In experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks using IBM Quantum devices, QuFid reduced measurement costs significantly while maintaining acceptable fidelity bias, compared to fixed-shot and learning-based methods.

Conclusion: QuFid offers an effective and efficient strategy for adaptive fidelity estimation in quantum computing, addressing hardware and noise challenges.

Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

TL;DR: This paper explores using Machine Learning to predict rare, large-scale events in scale-free processes like earthquakes, using methods such as Geometric Deep Learning with symmetry-based architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Machine Learning can predict rare, large events in processes that exhibit power law behavior (scale-free), commonly seen in phenomena like earthquakes or avalanches.

Method: Analyzed two self-similar models: fractional Gaussian field and Abelian sandpile. Tested various architectures like U-net, Riesz network, wavelet-based Graph Neural Network, Fourier-embedding layer, and Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator.

Result: Experiments highlighted challenges related to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations in models. Identified ways to mitigate these issues using proper inductive biases.

Conclusion: Incorporating symmetry and scale invariance in model designs can improve predictions of rare events in self-similar, scale-free processes through suitable adjustments to address biases.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RANDSMAPs, mass-preserving neural decoders, for solving pre-image problems in manifold learning with high accuracy and low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solutions for ill-posed pre-image problems in manifold learning are needed, especially methods that respect conservation laws.

Method: The authors use random Fourier features and multiscale techniques to create an explainable neural decoder with mass preservation constraints.

Result: RANDSMAPs achieve high reconstruction accuracy, computational efficiency, and enforce mass conservation when tested on various datasets.

Conclusion: RANDSMAPs are effective at solving challenging pre-image problems, are computationally efficient, and ensure mass conservation across scales.

Abstract: We introduce RANDSMAPs (Random-feature/multi-scale neural decoders with Mass Preservation), numerical analysis-informed, explainable neural decoders designed to explicitly respect conservation laws when solving the challenging ill-posed pre-image problem in manifold learning. We start by proving the equivalence of vanilla random Fourier feature neural networks to Radial Basis Function interpolation and the double Diffusion Maps (based on Geometric Harmonics) decoders in the deterministic limit. We then establish the theoretical foundations for RANDSMAP and introduce its multiscale variant to capture structures across multiple scales. We formulate and derive the closed-form solution of the corresponding constrained optimization problem and prove the mass preservation property. Numerically, we assess the performance of RANDSMAP on three benchmark problems/datasets with mass preservation obtained by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow PDE with shock waves, 2D rotated MRI brain images, and the Hughes crowd dynamics PDEs. We demonstrate that RANDSMAPs yield high reconstruction accuracy at low computational cost and maintain mass conservation at single-machine precision. In its vanilla formulation, the scheme remains applicable to the classical pre-image problem, i.e., when mass-preservation constraints are not imposed.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A stochastic trust-region method was proposed for nonconvex optimization using SVRG, ensuring convergence to a stationary point and outperforming conventional methods in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance optimization techniques by designing a method that accelerates convergence in nonconvex problems, without relying on function value evaluations.

Method: The method integrates SVRG into stochastic trust-region frameworks, adjusts the trust-region radius adaptively, and uses stochastic gradient and Hessian information.

Result: The algorithm achieves convergence to stationary points with competitive iteration and sample complexity, demonstrating superior performance over SGD and Adam in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines SVRG and stochastic trust-region techniques for efficient optimization in nonconvex setups, showing practicality in machine learning applications.

Abstract: We propose a stochastic trust-region method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization that incorporates stochastic variance-reduced gradients (SVRG) to accelerate convergence. Unlike classical trust-region methods, the proposed algorithm relies solely on stochastic gradient information and does not require function value evaluations. The trust-region radius is adaptively adjusted based on a radius-control parameter and the stochastic gradient estimate. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance. We also highlight the impact of batch size and inner-loop length on efficiency, and show that the proposed method outperforms SGD and Adam on several machine learning tasks.

*Yuze Chen,Yuan Zhou,Baichuan Mo,Jie Ying,Yufei Ruan,Zhou Ye*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores an online linear programming model considering gradual and stochastic inventory replenishment, introducing algorithms to address challenges in this unique setting and characterizing optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address operational scenarios like e-commerce fulfillment and renewable-powered systems where inventory is accumulated gradually instead of being available upfront, departing from classical online linear programming assumptions.

Method: New algorithms and regret analyses are developed for bounded, finite-support, and continuous-support distribution regimes. The techniques include achieving $\sqrt{T}$, $\log T$, and $\log^2 T$ regret in specific cases using novel formulations like a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm.

Result: The study provides optimal regret bounds for each distribution regime, distinguishes scenarios where sharp separations occur, and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms via empirical validation.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new replenishment-based OLP framework and delivers a near-complete understanding of achievable optimal regret bounds, showing superiority over classical adaptations empirically.

Abstract: We study an online linear programming (OLP) model in which inventory is not provided upfront but instead arrives gradually through an exogenous stochastic replenishment process. This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.
  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.

*Chun-Yi Kuan,Kai-Wei Chang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces AQAScore, a new method for audio-text evaluation, which shows improved accuracy over existing metrics like CLAPScore by using semantic reasoning and probabilistic verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning in current audio generation evaluation metrics inspired this work.

Method: The authors propose AQAScore, an evaluation framework using audio-aware large language models to compute alignment via log-probabilities of semantic queries, rather than open-ended generation.

Result: AQAScore demonstrates superior correlation with human judgments across benchmarks, outperforming similarity-based and generative prompting methods.

Conclusion: AQAScore is effective in addressing limitations in current evaluation metrics, offering improved fine-grained semantic consistency and scalability.

Abstract: Although text-to-audio generation has made remarkable progress in realism and diversity, the development of evaluation metrics has not kept pace. Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a "Yes" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.

### [375] [Scaling Ambiguity: Augmenting Human Annotation in Speech Emotion Recognition with Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14620)
*Wenda Zhang,Hongyu Jin,Siyi Wang,Zhiqiang Wei,Ting Dang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates using Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) to create synthetic emotion annotations for better Speech Emotion Recognition and evaluates their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional emotion recognition models are limited by the use of single categorical labels and the challenges posed by ambiguous emotions due to lack of reliable annotations.

Method: The authors propose leveraging ALMs to generate Synthetic Perceptual Proxies that augment existing human annotations and address annotation scarcity. They also propose a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation (DiME-Aug) strategy to address class imbalance.

Result: Experiments on datasets like IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show improved emotion distribution through synthetic annotations, particularly in low-ambiguity cases, but less benefit in highly ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: ALMs demonstrate potential to tackle annotation challenges in ambiguous emotion recognition, though advanced strategies are needed for highly ambiguous emotions.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition models typically use single categorical labels, overlooking the inherent ambiguity of human emotions. Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.

*Nicolás Arrieta Larraza,Niels de Koeijer*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper adapts ULCNet for speech enhancement by replacing GRU layers with FastGRNNs and introducing a complementary filter to maintain performance while significantly reducing size and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance single-channel speech enhancement in resource-constrained embedded devices by lowering complexity and latency.

Method: Adapts ULCNet by utilizing FastGRNNs instead of GRU layers and introduces a trainable complementary filter to address FastGRNN's internal state drifting in long audio signals.

Result: Fast-ULCNet matches ULCNet's speech enhancement performance, reduces model size by over 50%, and achieves a 34% average latency reduction.

Conclusion: The novel Fast-ULCNet successfully balances state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational demands, making it suitable for embedded applications.

Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement algorithms are often used in resource-constrained embedded devices, where low latency and low complexity designs gain more importance. In recent years, researchers have proposed a wide variety of novel solutions to this problem. In particular, a recent deep learning model named ULCNet is among the state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. This paper proposes an adaptation of ULCNet, by replacing its GRU layers with FastGRNNs, to reduce both computational latency and complexity. Furthermore, this paper shows empirical evidence on the performance decay of FastGRNNs in long audio signals during inference due to internal state drifting, and proposes a novel approach based on a trainable complementary filter to mitigate it. The resulting model, Fast-ULCNet, performs on par with the state-of-the-art original ULCNet architecture on a speech enhancement task, while reducing its model size by more than half and decreasing its latency by 34% on average.

*Naoya Onizawa,Daisaku Katagiri,Warren J. Gross,Takahiro Hanyu*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper presents an analog-to-stochastic converter for vision chips, using magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) technology to reduce the overhead of traditional signal conversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiencies of current two-step analog-to-stochastic signal converters, particularly the power and area consumption in modern hardware applications like LDPC decoders and image processors.

Method: The authors propose utilizing MTJ devices for their probabilistic switching behavior to achieve one-step analog-to-stochastic signal conversion. The design is theoretically described, and compensation mechanisms for resistance variability are incorporated.

Result: The proposed converter is implemented in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies, and its functionality is confirmed through SPICE simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of the design.

Conclusion: The study showcases that leveraging MTJ behavior enables direct and efficient analog-to-stochastic conversion, reducing signal-conversion overhead in vision-chip applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an analog-to-stochastic converter using a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device for vision chips based on stochastic computation. Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To realize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal-conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the signal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices.

*Wentao Jiang,Jingxin Wang,Zhang Hu,Zhengyuan Shi,Chengyu Ma,Qiang Xu,Weikang Qian,Zhufei Chu*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPA, a GNN-based method for accurate delay prediction in post-mapping circuits, achieving significant delay reductions compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with delay estimations due to oversimplified, technology-agnostic models that fail to account for real post-mapping circuit behaviors.

Method: The paper presents GPA, a GNN framework utilizing three views of circuits (AIGs, technology mapping, critical timing paths) trained on real cell delays to achieve precise delay predictions.

Result: Tested on EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA reduces delays by 19.9%, 2.1%, and 4.1% compared to heuristics methods and the prior ML-based SLAP framework, without compromising area.

Conclusion: GPA overcomes systemic inaccuracies in conventional methods, significantly enhancing delay prediction and decision-making in circuit mapping.

Abstract: Traditional technology mapping suffers from systemic inaccuracies in delay estimation due to its reliance on abstract, technology-agnostic delay models that fail to capture the nuanced timing behavior behavior of real post-mapping circuits. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.

### [379] [Generating consensus and dissent on massive discussion platforms with an $O(N)$ semantic-vector model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13932)
*A. Ferrer,D. Muñoz-Jordán,A. Rivero,A. Tarancón,C. Tarancón,D. Yllanes*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for fostering consensus or dissent in collective intelligence platforms using a dynamical system model and semantic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address human bias in preserving initial ideas that limits achieving global consensus and optimize outcomes in massive discussion networks.

Method: The paper proposes a dynamical system based on the $O(N)$ model where users are nodes on a lattice, their ideas are semantic vectors derived from a pretrained embedding model, and equilibrium states are studied based on a coupling parameter $β$.

Result: For $β>0$, global consensus (ferromagnetic phase) emerges, while for $β<0$, maximum dissent (antiferromagnetic phase) occurs.

Conclusion: This framework helps manage cohesion and diversity within collective intelligence platforms, offering a tunable method for fostering consensus or disagreement based on semantic closeness.

Abstract: Reaching consensus on massive discussion networks is critical for reducing noise and achieving optimal collective outcomes. However, the natural tendency of humans to preserve their initial ideas constrains the emergence of global solutions. To address this, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms facilitate the discovery of globally superior solutions. We introduce a dynamical system based on the standard $O(N)$ model to drive the aggregation of semantically similar ideas. The system consists of users represented as nodes in a $d=2$ lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions, where their ideas are represented by semantic vectors computed with a pretrained embedding model. We analyze the system's equilibrium states as a function of the coupling parameter $β$. Our results show that $β> 0$ drives the system toward a ferromagnetic-like phase (global consensus), while $β< 0$ induces an antiferromagnetic-like state (maximum dissent), where users maximize semantic distance from their neighbors. This framework offers a controllable method for managing the tradeoff between cohesion and diversity in CI platforms.

### [380] [CAG-Avatar: Cross-Attention Guided Gaussian Avatars for High-Fidelity Head Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14844)
*Zhe Chang,Haodong Jin,Yan Song,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, CAG-Avatar, enhancing the quality and adaptive control of real-time drivable 3D head avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current animation techniques lack the ability to capture distinct dynamics of various facial regions, leading to artifacts like blurring and distortion.

Method: The proposed method uses a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module based on cross-attention to enable adaptive extraction of driving signals for each 3D Gaussian primitive.

Result: The framework improves reconstruction fidelity, especially in challenging areas like teeth, while maintaining real-time rendering performance.

Conclusion: CAG-Avatar offers a tailored approach for precise modeling of facial dynamics, effectively resolving limitations of global tuning methods in real-time 3D animations.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, real-time drivable 3D head avatars is a core challenge in digital animation. While 3D Gaussian Splashing (3D-GS) offers unprecedented rendering speed and quality, current animation techniques often rely on a "one-size-fits-all" global tuning approach, where all Gaussian primitives are uniformly driven by a single expression code. This simplistic approach fails to unravel the distinct dynamics of different facial regions, such as deformable skin versus rigid teeth, leading to significant blurring and distortion artifacts. We introduce Conditionally-Adaptive Gaussian Avatars (CAG-Avatar), a framework that resolves this key limitation. At its core is a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module built on cross-attention. This mechanism empowers each 3D Gaussian to act as a query, adaptively extracting relevant driving signals from the global expression code based on its canonical position. This "tailor-made" conditioning strategy drastically enhances the modeling of fine-grained, localized dynamics. Our experiments confirm a significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity, particularly for challenging regions such as teeth, while preserving real-time rendering performance.
