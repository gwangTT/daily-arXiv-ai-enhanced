Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but\nthey fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific\nanalyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting\nthree-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we\nleverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein\nsequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In\nparticular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token\nsequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's\nsequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline\nof AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code\nfragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA\nfrom lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse\ndatasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming\nlanguages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently\noutperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover,\nAlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in\nlarge-scale clone detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlphaCC adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure technique to detect semantic code clones across programming languages.", "motivation": "Current code clone detection methods struggle with capturing code semantics and are often tied to specific programming languages.", "method": "AlphaCC encodes code fragments as token sequences, uses multiple sequence alignment, adapts AlphaFold's attention-based encoder to model dependencies, and calculates similarity scores to classify clones.", "result": "AlphaCC outperforms baselines in semantic clone detection on diverse datasets, demonstrating strong semantic capabilities while maintaining efficiency.", "conclusion": "AlphaCC provides a practical and effective solution for multi-language code clone detection, showing promise for real-world applications."}}
