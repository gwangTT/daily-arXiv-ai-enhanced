Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,\nas it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces\n(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code\ntransformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most\nof the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage\nor support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,\nwe develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between\nany arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due\nto the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code\ngeneration and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.\nBefore building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library\nmigration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that\nLLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps\ncan further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a\ncommand line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and\ndynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool\non 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find\nthat PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of\nthe remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left\nfor developers to fix for more than half of the projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces PyMigTool, an end-to-end automated solution leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for library migration in Python projects, combining LLMs with static and dynamic analysis.", "motivation": "Library migration is difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming, often requiring extensive understanding of APIs and manual code transformations.

In this way, during inference, the distilled\n3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding\nnoise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference\nprocess. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP\nembedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint\ndiversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then\ndevelop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D\ninstance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to\ndistill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the\nstudent model.

However, such approaches\noften introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for\nthe performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this\nwork, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls\nthe performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In\nparticular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,\nformulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently\ndetermine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,\nusing the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes\nensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner.

To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this\napproach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the\ncontext of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with\nreadily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on\nunrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic\norigin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across\na wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB\nand SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on\nAgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper tackles indirect prompt injection attacks on LLM agents by introducing a token-level sanitization method, which removes potentially harmful AI-directed instructions from tool outputs rather than relying on sample-level classification.", "motivation": "Indirect prompt injections on LLM agents with access to tools and sensitive data pose risks due to high false positive rates of current defenses, which hinders real-world applications.", "method": "The authors propose a token-level sanitization method that removes executable instructions at the token level, is non-blocking, calibration-free, context-agnostic, and uses instruction-tuning data for training instead of synthetic injection examples.", "result": "The proposed method significantly reduces attack success rates (e.g., from 34% to 3% on AgentDojo) while maintaining agent utility across both benign and malicious settings.", "conclusion": "Token-level sanitization provides a practical, effective, and generalizable defense against indirect prompt injection attacks, addressing the limitations of existing classifiers."}}

Our course aims to provide\nnecessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and\npractitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.\nAll Jupyter notebooks with demonstrations associated to this tutorial can be\nfound on the project webpage: https://sinbag.github.io/mcmc/", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as a key component in enhancing generative AI models and physically-based rendering.", "motivation": "To explore how MCMC can unify techniques in diffusion-based generative models and physically-based rendering, as no unified framework currently exists.", "method": "The paper proposes studying the use of MCMC in generative processes, focusing on both theoretical and practical tools for understanding its role in parameter space exploration and sampling high-dimensional distributions.", "result": "The paper introduces preliminary steps and tools to establish MCMC as a bridge between generative AI and physically-based rendering methodologies.", "conclusion": "MCMC methods have the potential to unite different areas of generative modeling and physically-based rendering, providing insights and tools for academic and practical advancements."}}
