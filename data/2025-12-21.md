### [1] [Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736)
*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anubuddhi is a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language inputs, achieving high alignment between design and simulation to aid research and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and democratize quantum optics experiment design and simulation by enabling natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming skills.

Method: The paper presents a system that uses semantic retrieval, physics simulations, intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation to compose, refine, and validate experimental designs.

Result: The system successfully designed and simulated 13 quantum optics experiments, achieving high design-simulation alignment and proving effective for a broad range of quantum optics use cases.

Conclusion: Anubuddhi facilitates computational experiment design, serving as a powerful tool for research and education, with the potential for refinement through user interaction.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [2] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD) introduces a formula-driven ethical framework for scaling moral responsibility with epistemic uncertainty, balancing decisive action against uncertainty resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks fail to adequately account for decision-making under uncertainty, leading to oversimplified constraints on action. The paper seeks to address this by creating a model where moral duty dynamically adjusts based on the agent's epistemic state.

Method: It develops the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), expressed mathematically as D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], integrating variables like knowledge, humility, and contextual signals. Monte Carlo simulations validate the framework's performance and stability.

Result: The PPD model highlights how moral duty transitions between action and repair based on uncertainty levels. Simulations show that systems including humility coefficients (lambda > 0) are more stable and less likely to act overconfidently.

Conclusion: PPD provides a tractable and cross-disciplinary method for modeling ethical responsibility, adaptable to fields like AI, clinical ethics, law, and governance. It stabilizes complex systems by balancing confidence and contextual risk dynamically.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

### [3] [Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743)
*David Noever*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for generating assembly instructions from natural language inputs using large language models, guided by a discrete parts vocabulary to ensure physical realizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output using an AI-guided method that supports natural language-based assembly instructions.

Method: The framework uses LDraw as an intermediate representation and introduces tools to guide language models for step-by-step assembly instructions. Physical prototyping leverages a Python library for modular model generation.

Result: The approach successfully produces over 3000 valid assembly steps across domains like satellites, aircraft, and architecture, demonstrating scalability and fidelity.

Conclusion: The 'bag of bricks' method provides a novel interface linking semantic language inputs to geometric outputs, enabling consistent physical prototyping from natural language with potential applications in engineering and manufacturing.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

### [4] [Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776)
*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Language Models struggle to guide sensor-limited agents due to communicative grounding errors in collaborative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of symbolic grounding and communication errors in tasks involving asymmetrical information distribution.

Method: Developed the Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR for experiments and analyzed performance gaps between Leader and Follower agents.

Result: Findings show a significant "Success Gap" caused by communicative grounding errors, impacting half of feasible plans. Pull-based querying protocols perform better than push-based instructions in collaboration.

Conclusion: Enhancing active uncertainty reduction mechanisms is critical for improving human-AI and robot-robot collaborative systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [5] [Subjective functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15948)
*Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the origin and synthesis of objective functions, proposing subjective functions endogenous to agents as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans synthesize objectives and to explore ways to equip artificial systems with similar capabilities.

Method: Introduces the concept of subjective functions, endogenous objective functions defined with respect to the agent's features.

Result: Expected prediction error serves as an example to showcase and study the subjective function concept.

Conclusion: The proposal bridges ideas across psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, enhancing insights into adaptive intelligence.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

### [6] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology proposes a novel governance and explanation framework for AI systems using population-level surveillance of AI outputs, focusing on statistical evidence rather than complex model mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods struggle with the complexity of deployed AI models, making it challenging to ensure safety and reliability at scale. There is a need for a practical approach that empowers domain experts to oversee AI systems without requiring technical expertise.

Method: The approach standardizes the capture of AI-expert interactions into risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score—exposure variables that predict output failure statistically. It passively tracks expert interactions with AI, validating predictions against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.

Result: The framework achieves population-level surveillance, enables automatic audit trails, ensures governance consistency across models/vendors, and provides reliability scores with semantic assessments for detecting unreliable AI outputs early.

Conclusion: AI Epidemiology offers a scalable and practical governance model that empowers domain experts to oversee AI safety and reliability without deep machine learning knowledge, ensuring early detection of harmful outputs and continuity across systems.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

### [7] [Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784)
*Zibin Liu,Cheng Zhang,Xi Zhao,Yunfei Feng,Bingyu Bai,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM proposes a memory-centric system for LLM agents to evolve without retraining, enhancing personalization, efficiency, and capability while reducing computational overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in current LLM agents, particularly the need for costly retraining to enhance personalization, efficiency, and task capability.

Method: MOBIMEM introduces three memory primitives (Profile Memory, Experience Memory, Action Memory) and integrates OS-inspired services: a scheduler, record-and-replay mechanism, and context-aware exception handling.

Result: MOBIMEM improves profile alignment (83.1%), speeds up retrieval (23.83 ms, 280x faster than baselines), increases task success rates (up to 50.3%), and reduces latency (up to 9x) on mobile devices.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM demonstrates that incorporating a memory-centric design can enable iterative self-evolution in LLM agents, improving performance and efficiency without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

### [8] [State-Augmented Graphs for Circular Economy Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15824)
*Richard Fox,Rui Li,Gustav Jonsson,Farzaneh Goli,Miying Yang,Emel Aktas,Yongjing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel decision-making framework for optimizing circular economy triage by leveraging a state-augmented disassembly sequencing graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and sustainability of circular economy triage decisions by addressing processing costs, constraints, and product value retention.

Method: The proposed method employs a deterministic solver over a state-augmented disassembly sequencing graph, enforcing the Markov property for recursive evaluation.

Result: The framework was demonstrated using EV battery triage, showcasing its ability to handle varying complexities, safety requirements, and economic influences.

Conclusion: The framework offers a tractable and generalizable foundation to optimize circular economy triage decisions across diverse products and conditions.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

### [9] [PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs), when queried by anxious parents using pressure-driven language, are prone to safety vulnerabilities in pediatric guidance. PediatricAnxietyBench, a benchmark of queries, evaluates clinical failures under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the safety and reliability of LLMs, which are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric advice, particularly in stressful situations that might compromise their output.

Method: The authors introduce PediatricAnxietyBench, consisting of 300 diverse pediatric queries, including adversarial ones, and evaluate two Llama models (70B and 8B) using a comprehensive safety framework.

Result: The 70B model displayed better safety outcomes than the 8B model, but both were susceptible to failure under adversarial pressures, particularly with urgent language. Mean safety scores were low, and vulnerabilities in managing seizures and post-vaccination advice were highlighted.

Conclusion: While larger models present improved safety performance, LLMs are not sufficiently robust against parental pressures and adversarial inquiries. PediatricAnxietyBench serves as a tool to identify critical failures in pediatric applications of AI models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

### [10] [Darth Vecdor: An Open-Source System for Generating Knowledge Graphs Through Large Language Model Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15906)
*Jonathan A. Handler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Darth Vecdor (DV) is a tool that extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and organizes it into a SQL-based knowledge graph, offering a solution for structured, safer, and high-volume querying. It is open-source but comes with possible risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges associated with directly querying LLMs, such as cost, speed, safety, and inconsistent responses, especially for domains like healthcare where accuracy and efficiency are critical.

Method: The author built Darth Vecdor (DV), a system that extracts structured data from LLMs into a SQL database. It includes features to mitigate issues like errors, overly general or inconsistent responses, and supports multi-element answers via an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

Result: DV was released as free, open-source software and designed to offer structured and query-able knowledge. It provides users with tools to resolve issues in querying LLMs through a standard database system.

Conclusion: While DV shows potential in improving domains like healthcare, users must carefully assess risks and ensure safe applications due to possible bugs and limitations. The collaborative improvement of DV could enhance its impact.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

### [11] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework using a spreading activation algorithm integrated with automatically constructed knowledge graphs to improve multi-hop reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle to reliably retrieve multi-step evidence for complex reasoning tasks and fail to account for varying credibility and connections in large corpora. Existing GraphRAG approaches face challenges due to dependence on high-quality knowledge graphs.

Method: The authors introduce a RAG framework that uses the spreading activation algorithm with automatically constructed knowledge graphs to enhance information retrieval during complex tasks.

Result: Their framework outperforms standard and iterative RAG approaches, showing a 39% absolute gain in answer correctness, especially when combined with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval, even using small open-weight language models.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves multi-hop reasoning performance, is adaptable to various RAG systems, and is particularly effective in computationally constrained environments.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

### [12] [Small Language Models for Efficient Agentic Tool Calling: Outperforming Large Models with Targeted Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15943)
*Polaris Jhandi,Owais Kazi,Shreyas Subramanian,Neel Sendas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small Language Models (SLMs), when optimized and fine-tuned, can supplant Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks, drastically reducing costs and computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of generative AI is hindered by the high computational costs of LLMs, motivating exploration of SLMs for cost and efficiency benefits.

Method: The study fine-tuned the facebook/opt-350m model using Hugging Face's TRL SFT trainer for tasks like summarization, query answering, and data interpretation.

Result: The fine-tuned SLM achieved a 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, outperforming benchmarks like ChatGPT-CoT (26.00%) and ToolLLaMA (16.27%-30.18%).

Conclusion: SLMs can provide comparable performance to LLMs in specific domains with reduced costs, making generative AI more accessible at scale.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

### [13] [Conversational Time Series Foundation Models: Towards Explainable and Effective Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16022)
*Defu Cao,Michael Gee,Jinbo Liu,Hengxuan Wang,Wei Yang,Rui Wang,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes repositioning Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for ensemble-based time series forecasting, outperforming popular models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting lacks consistent superiority among existing models, necessitating an optimal ensemble approach with interpretability.

Method: Introduce R1-style fine-tuning with SHAP-based guidance to enhance LLMs in evaluating and orchestrating forecasting ensemble models effectively.

Result: On the GIFT-Eval benchmark with 23 datasets, the approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, improving performance significantly across CRPS and MASE metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs, when strategically tuned and applied, can redefine time series forecasting by combining ensemble optimization with causally-grounded interpretability.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

### [14] [Do Large Language Models Know What They Don't Know? Kalshibench: A New Benchmark for Evaluating Epistemic Calibration via Prediction Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16030)
*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KalshiBench, a benchmark for evaluating the epistemic calibration of large language models (LLMs) using real-world prediction market questions. It finds systematic overconfidence in all tested models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well LLMs can quantify uncertainty about unknown future events, as opposed to merely performing well on static knowledge benchmarks.

Method: The KalshiBench dataset with 300 prediction market questions was used to test LLMs. Models' calibration and Brier Skill Scores were analyzed to evaluate their ability to express uncertainty accurately.

Result: Systematic overconfidence was observed in all models. The best-calibrated model, Claude Opus 4.5, had an ECE of 0.120 but still showed significant errors. Enhanced reasoning models, such as GPT-5.2-XHigh, exhibited worse calibration.

Conclusion: Scaling and improved reasoning capabilities do not guarantee better epistemic calibration. Calibration is a distinct aspect requiring separate improvement efforts.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

*Diane Myung-kyung Woodbridge,Allyson Seba,Freddie Seba,Aydin Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper developed a system that analyzes and categorizes AI-related academic policies in educational institutions using unsupervised topic modeling and large language models to guide responsible integration of GenAI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by the increasing use of GenAI in education, including risks like misinformation and diminished critical thinking, while offering clarity on inconsistent AI policy frameworks across institutions.

Method: The authors implemented an automated system combining unsupervised topic modeling for discovering policy themes and large language models (e.g., GPT-4.0) to classify policy categories and GenAI allowances.

Result: The system achieved a coherence score of 0.73 in topic discovery and classification accuracies with precision ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 and recall from 0.85 to 0.97 across eight topics.

Conclusion: The developed tool ensures clarity in AI-related educational policies, enabling safe and effective use of GenAI in academic settings while supporting student compliance and understanding.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

Motivation: Artists face difficulties navigating complex parameter spaces in generative art, potentially missing interesting configurations due to reliance on manual trial-and-error.

Method: The authors developed ParamExplorer, integrating it with p5.js projects, and implemented modular exploration strategies (agents) inspired by reinforcement learning, allowing human or automated feedback.

Result: The presented framework and agents facilitated the discovery of aesthetically compelling outputs in generative art systems while simplifying the navigation of complex parameter spaces.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer enhances generative art workflows by efficiently assisting with parameter exploration and automates feedback to reduce the manual effort required to find aesthetic configurations.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WeMusic-Agent, a framework for conversational music recommendation that utilizes both internalized musical knowledge and external tools.

They developed WeMusic-Agent-M1, a model trained on a large music-related corpus, and additionally created a benchmark for evaluation using real-world WeChat Listen data.

Result: Experiments show that WeMusic-Agent significantly outperforms existing conversational music recommendation models in areas like relevance, personalization, and diversity.

Conclusion: WeMusic-Agent exemplifies the effective combination of internal knowledge and tool utilization in conversational AI, enabling substantial performance improvements for personalized music recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data pipelines for training LLMs require costly API calls and lack multi-hop reasoning capabilities, making tool-calling learning inefficient.

Method: ToolForge synthesizes tool-learning data by leveraging (question, golden context, answer) triples, enhancing data quality with multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection, complemented by a Multi-Layer Validation Framework.

Result: A model with 8B parameters trained on ToolForge data outperformed GPT-4o on various benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of the framework.

Conclusion: ToolForge provides an efficient and robust automated synthesis framework enabling impactful tool-calling capabilities in LLMs; its datasets and code are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Weighted K-harmonic Means (WKHM) clustering, emphasizing its numerical stability and stochastic convergence guarantees. It offers improvements for wireless network applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address numerical instability in clustering algorithms and improve handling of user association in wireless networks while ensuring mathematical guarantees for convergence.

Method: The proposed method is WKHM, a variant of K-harmonic means designed for stability and feasible soft assignments using inverse-distance weighting. It incorporates theoretical convergence proofs under deterministic and stochastic conditions.

Result: WKHM showcases superior performance in balancing signal strength and load fairness for wireless networks, supported by simulation comparison to other clustering approaches.

Conclusion: This clustering algorithm is a robust solution for wireless network optimization, offering both stability and improved performance. The first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering are presented.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

*Jianming Liu,Ren Zhu,Jian Xu,Kun Ding,Xu-Yao Zhang,Gaofeng Meng,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDE-Agent is a new framework employing multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration, leveraging the reasoning abilities of LLMs for automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in traditional and neural network-based PDE solving approaches, which require significant manual setup and domain knowledge.

Method: It introduces a Prog-Act framework with graph memory for dynamic planning and error correction, and a Resource-Pool for managing runtime artifacts and resolving inter-tool dependency gaps.

Result: It achieves superior performance in complex PDE tasks, validated through the PDE-Bench benchmark and multi-level metrics for tool coordination.

Conclusion: PDE-Agent represents a paradigm shift, advancing automated scientific computing and enhancing PDE solving through innovative multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRITE enhances spatial reasoning in AI by using simulators and LLMs to generate diverse, precise datasets for training VLMs, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are limited in spatial reasoning capabilities due to either rigid template datasets or unscalable manual annotations.

Method: SPRITE employs simulators and LLMs to convert spatial reasoning into a code-generation task. This ensures data scalability, high linguistic diversity, and computational precision.

Result: A curated dataset with 11k+ scenes and 300k+ training pairs significantly improved VLM performance on spatial benchmarks, surpassing other open-source datasets.

Conclusion: SPRITE’s scalable and diverse framework bridges the gap in spatial intelligence, enabling robust data creation and setting a foundation for future advancements in this field.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework to merge large language models (LLMs) while preserving alignment and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current merging methods for fine-tuned LLMs can preserve loss but often degrade alignment, requiring geometry-aware techniques to maintain capabilities and safety.

Method: The authors introduce AlignMerge, using a geometry-aware workflow with loss functions (L_geo, L_align, L_bud) to ensure alignment invariants, incorporating the Alignment Quality Index (AQI) for latent-space alignment evaluation.

Result: AlignMerge enhances alignment metrics across multiple model families while matching or exceeding task-specific expert performance, showcasing improved alignment subspace stability.

Conclusion: Alignment-preserving merging should be prioritized in future LLM developments, demonstrating the feasibility of geometry-aware composition for foundational models.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper presents AMUSE, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) in agentic, dialogue-intensive tasks. It also introduces RAFT, a framework for improving these models' performance through reward optimization and efficient parameter adaptation, showcasing a significant improvement in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current MLLMs in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric, audio-video tasks requiring agentic reasoning, like conversational video assistants and meeting analytics.

Method: The paper develops AMUSE, a benchmark with tasks requiring decomposed reasoning steps, and proposes RAFT, a framework combining reward optimization, self-evaluation, and selective parameter adaptation for model improvement.

Result: RAFT improves performance on AMUSE tasks by up to 39.52% accuracy. Current MLLMs still show weak reasoning and inconsistent behavior under multi-speaker and agentic evaluations.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT together provide key tools for evaluating and advancing agentic reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of asynchronous actions in real-world agent tasks by introducing an agent-side approach, enabling large language models (LLMs) to accurately align their action timing with the physical environment using temporal predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome scalability and observation redundancy challenges faced by current methods (e.g., blocking wrappers or frequent polling) for managing non-blocking actions with variable latencies.

Method: The authors propose extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to include temporal predictions using semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL), allowing agents to calibrate their action timing through time.sleep(t).

Result: Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster show successful calibration by the agents, reducing query overhead and execution latency while maintaining effective synchronization.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is demonstrated as an essential and learnable capability for LLM-based autonomous agents operating in dynamic, asynchronous environments.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuadSentinel, a framework for improving safety control in large language model-based agents using four specialized guard agents and machine-checkable safety policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks posed by large language model-based agents working on complex tasks, where natural language policies are ambiguous and difficult to enforce.

Method: The QuadSentinel framework comprises four agents (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that implement safety policies via machine-checkable rules built from observable state predicates and resolve conflicts using top-k predicate logic.

Result: QuadSentinel outperforms single-agent baselines (e.g., ShieldAgent) on benchmarks such as ST-WebAgentBench and AgentHarm, enhancing guardrail accuracy, rule recall, and reducing false positives.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an efficient and effective means to ensure safety in large language model-based agents without requiring modifications to their core functionality.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

*Zhenyu Wu,Jingjing Xie,Zehao Li,Bowen Yang,Qiushi Sun,Zhaoyang Liu,Zhoumianze Liu,Yu Qiao,Xiangyu Yue,Zun Wang,Zichen Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in step-level decision-making for VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) and introduces OS-Oracle, a framework to improve decision assessment in GUI-based environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long workflows in CUAs can accumulate errors, leading to critical missteps. Reliable critic models are needed, but their development is hindered by insufficient GUI feedback data and a lack of evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The authors developed OS-Oracle, comprising: (1) a data pipeline generating GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm using supervised fine-tuning and CP-GRPO; and (3) a comprehensive benchmark (OS-Critic Bench) to evaluate critic models on diverse platforms.

Result: A dataset with 310k critic samples was curated, and the OS-Oracle-7B model surpassed other open-source VLMs and proprietary models in performance. It also enhanced native GUI agents' capabilities on specific platforms.

Conclusion: OS-Oracle-7B provides state-of-the-art solutions for GUI-based CUAs, with advancements in testing and data generation. The open-sourced framework benefits future research and application development.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples.

*Fanrui Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Sizhuo Zhou,Jianwen Sun,Chuanhao Li,Jiaxin Ai,Yukang Feng,Yujie Zhang,Wenjie Li,Zizhen Li,Yifan Chang,Jiawei Liu,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ForenAgent, an interactive framework for image forgery detection that leverages the synergy of high-level semantic reasoning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and low-level artifacts via Python-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image forgery detection methods struggle to unify low-level artifact analysis with high-level semantic insights from MLLMs due to their heterogeneous reasoning approaches.

Method: The proposed ForenAgent framework utilizes MLLMs to autonomously create and improve Python-based low-level tools to analyze forgery. It employs a unique two-step training process: Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, along with a dynamic human-inspired reasoning loop.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate ForenAgent's competence in using interactive tools and reasoning effectively on intricate IFD tasks, outperforming traditional methods. A large dataset, FABench, was also developed for robust training and evaluation.

Conclusion: ForenAgent bridges the gap between semantic and artifact-based analysis for general-purpose image forgery detection and showcases potential for improved interpretability and flexibility in forensic analysis.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic framework to unify diverse research in AI adaptation strategies, focusing on agent and tool adaptations, and aims to provide design guidance for more capable AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing complexity of adapting agentic AI systems built on foundation models, and to enhance their performance, reliability, and generalization.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework categorizing agent and tool adaptations, analyze these strategies, and provide practical guidance to navigate trade-offs in system design.

Result: The framework clarifies adaptation strategies in AI, identifies explicit trade-offs, and highlights strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The research serves as a conceptual and practical guide for creating more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems, while identifying open challenges for future exploration.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

### [30] [Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317)
*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-aware 'Proof of Quality' framework for decentralized LLM inference, balancing output quality and computational cost using a novel reward mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable transparent and censorship-resistant access to large language models (LLMs) while addressing challenges in scaling verification approaches for modern models.

Method: The paper proposes a new cost-aware 'Proof of Quality' (PoQ) framework that integrates cost-efficiency metrics into rewards, combining token-level F1 scores, learned evaluators, and GPT-based judgments within a single evaluation pipeline.

Result: Experimental results show that semantic textual similarity bi encoders provide higher correlations with ground truths and that larger models deliver higher efficiency per cost unit. Monte Carlo simulations validate the reward scheme, favoring high-quality, low-cost inference and evaluation nodes.

Conclusion: The cost-aware PoQ framework provides a practical and economically sustainable approach for decentralized LLM inference, optimizing for both quality and cost efficiencies.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between AI's perceived transformative potential and its actual measurable impact in scientific and commercial domains.

Method: Critique of current AI architectures and exploration of opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing; establishment of a roadmap for 'Big AI'.

Result: Identified shortcomings in current AI technologies and presented prospects for integrating theoretical physics with machine learning methodologies.

Conclusion: Physics has more to offer AI than AI can offer physics currently; leveraging physics principles may enable the next generation of impactful AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

Motivation: To address the need for improved optimization techniques by mimicking human path selection and construction behaviors, offering an alternative to existing metaheuristic algorithms.

Method: PCIA generates a random population akin to particles, representing paths toward a destination. It simulates the intelligent mixing of pathways and random selection to maneuver through various optimization challenges.

Result: PCIA was tested on 53 mathematical and 13 constrained optimization problems and proved highly competitive compared to both established and new metaheuristic algorithms.

Conclusion: PCIA provides a robust and competitive solution for optimization problems, showcasing its ability to compete with or surpass existing techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Synthelite achieves success rates of up to 95% in constrained synthesis tasks, demonstrates flexibility in accommodating user-specified constraints, and ensures chemical feasibility in route design.

Conclusion: Synthelite is presented as a highly capable and interactive tool, positioning LLMs as key enablers in the advancement of synthesis planning frameworks.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed and less diverse AI configurations in traditional MARL benchmarking environments like SMAC.

Method: Created SC2BA, an advanced multi-agent competitive environment, along with the APyMARL library, designed for robust inter-algorithm adversary evaluations. Benchmarks were tested under pairwise and multi-algorithm adversarial modes.

Result: The experiment revealed critical issues with the current MARL algorithms, including their effectiveness, sensitivity, and scalability.

Conclusion: SC2BA and its benchmarks represent a significant advancement in MARL, enabling better evaluation of algorithms and promoting further progress for the field.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.

Method: The authors developed a prompting framework (TS2R) that translates raw battery time-series data into semantically enriched natural language reports through segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation.

Result: TS2R outperformed traditional baselines in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management tasks, leading to better LLM performance in accuracy, robustness, and explainability.

Conclusion: TS2R enables LLMs to achieve expert-level performance in BESS management without requiring retraining, offering a practical path for integrating LLMs into adaptive battery intelligence systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

TL;DR: cuPilot introduces a novel multi-agent framework for CUDA kernel optimization, achieving significant speedups and hardware utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing CUDA kernels is difficult and requires specialized expertise, while existing automatic optimization approaches underperform.

Method: A multi-agent framework called cuPilot using strategy-coordinated evolution algorithms, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

Result: Generated kernels achieved an average of 3.09x speed up over PyTorch on benchmarks and efficient hardware usage in GEMM tasks.

Conclusion: cuPilot enhances CUDA kernel optimization with intelligent strategies, and its outputs are open-sourced for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

*Danial Safaei,Siddartha Khastgir,Mohsen Alirezaei,Jeroen Ploeg,Son Tong,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a metric to measure causal agreement in simulation-to-reality transfer for autonomous vehicles using matched synthetic-real pairs and explainable AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fidelity measures for autonomous vehicle simulation focus on visual realism but fail to ensure causal consistency between real and simulated environments. There is a need to ground fidelity in the causal decision-making mechanisms of the system-under-test.

Method: The proposed method uses Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), employing explainable AI (XAI) to compare the decisive features driving the system's decisions across real-synthetic matched pairs. Additionally, DFF-guided calibration is introduced to improve consistency.

Result: Using 2126 KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 matched pairs, DFF detected causal discrepancies overlooked by conventional measures, and DFF-guided calibration enhanced both decisive-feature- and input-level fidelity without degrading output-level fidelity.

Conclusion: DFF provides a behavior-centric fidelity measure that evaluates causal consistency, addressing gaps in simulation-to-reality transfer. It enhances simulator performance through guided calibration methods.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores running large language and vision-language models on edge devices using only CPUs, identifies computational scaling laws, and proposes quantum-inspired compression for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance computational and energy constraints while enabling local deployment of language and vision-language models on consumer and embedded devices relying on CPUs instead of GPUs.

Method: Benchmarking CPU-only inference on dual hardware tiers (MacBook Pro M2 and Raspberry Pi 5), analyzing computational scaling with token length and image resolution, and introducing quantum-inspired compression techniques.

Result: Identified two computational scaling laws for language (linear with token length) and vision-language models (non-linear 'resolution knee'), and demonstrated quantum-inspired compression cuts processor, memory usage, and energy consumption significantly.

Conclusion: Proposes scaling laws and compression techniques as impactful strategies for efficient and sustainable edge device inference, advocating these methods for low-cost and energy-constrained environments.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

*Himanshu Gharat,Himanshi Agrawal,Gourab K. Patro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in memory-enhanced personalized agents that utilize large language models, using recruitment as an example to highlight bias introduction and reinforcement during personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how memory-enhanced personalization in AI agents may introduce or amplify biases, which is an underexplored area despite its relevance to safeguarding fairness in AI applications.

Method: The study simulates a memory-enhanced personalized agent using recruitment as a test case and conducts experiments on safety-trained large language models to detect and analyze bias formation across operational stages.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that memory-enhanced personalization systematically introduces and reinforces bias in AI agents, even when using safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Memory-enhanced personalized agents, though beneficial, pose risks of bias introduction and amplification, necessitating additional safeguards or structural checks to prevent unfair outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation.

### [43] [Needle in the Web: A Benchmark for Retrieving Targeted Web Pages in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16553)
*Yumeng Wang,Tianyu Fan,Lingrui Xu,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Needle in the Web, a benchmark addressing fuzzy exploratory searches, evaluating LLMs' retrieval and reasoning capabilities in ambiguous web queries, highlighting their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize complex reasoning searches but neglect ambiguous exploratory queries where users seek multifaceted answers.

Method: The authors develop the Needle in the Web benchmark with 663 questions across seven domains, using a methodology to create queries of varying difficulty based on web content claims.

Result: Most tested LLMs and search systems achieve less than 35% accuracy, revealing struggles with fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity across domains and difficulties.

Conclusion: Current LLMs and search agents face significant challenges in handling exploratory searches, necessitating improvements for addressing uncertainty and ambiguity in web content retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

*Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Zhihui Lu,Yi Zhao,Yuansen Zhang,Shijing Hu,Qiang Duan,Yinggui Wang,Tao Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prefix Probing, a simple and efficient method to detect harmful content in large language models with minimal computational cost and latency, without requiring additional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost in harmful content detection for large language models in safety-critical applications.

Method: The approach compares conditional log-probabilities of designated prefixes (related to agreement or refusal) using a prefix caching technique for fast computation. It uses a prefix construction algorithm to optimize and enhance detection performance.

Result: Prefix Probing achieves detection performance similar to mainstream external safety models but with significantly lower computational costs and no need for extra model deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed method is practical, efficient, and highly effective, making it well-suited for real-world safety-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

*Sri Yash Tadimalla,Justin Cary,Gordon Hull,Jordan Register,Daniel Maxwell,David Pugalee,Tina Heafner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need for systemic shifts in AI education to prioritize critical and ethical thinking over functional use of AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current educational systems fail to address the literacy gap surrounding ethical and critical reasoning about AI, focusing too much on practical skills.

Method: Advocates for AI literacy frameworks that prioritize human agency, critical thinking, and epistemological understanding in educational practices.

Result: Proposes AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks to empower educators and students in making human-centric decisions about AI.

Conclusion: Critical AI literacy should empower stakeholders to intentionally and responsibly engage with AI, emphasizing choice and agency over inevitability.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study applies the Apriori algorithm to analyze semantic relations in Islamic texts, focusing on the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari. It identifies meaningful thematic associations, aiding digital Islamic studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in the need to automate thematic analysis of hadith texts due to increasing digitalization in Islamic studies.

Method: The authors applied unsupervised learning using the Apriori algorithm on preprocessed Indonesian hadith data. Parameters like support, confidence, and lift were analyzed.

Result: The study uncovered patterns like rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story denoting themes of worship, revelation, and narration.

Conclusion: The Apriori algorithm effectively identifies latent semantic relationships in texts, advancing digital Islamic studies and automated learning systems.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

*Mahbub E Sobhani,Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi,Mohammad Nehad Alam,Proma Hossain Progga,Swakkhar Shatabda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of multi-agent versus single-agent pipelines in solving diagram-grounded geometry problems across several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the comparative benefits of multi-agent designs versus single-agent systems in multimodal large language models for complex visual mathematics problems.

Method: The authors tested single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math) using open-source and proprietary models like Qwen-2.5-VL and Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Result: Multi-agent systems consistently perform better for open-source models, achieving significant improvements, while proprietary models like Gemini-2.0-Flash showed minimal gains using multi-agent approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-agent designs are beneficial for open-source systems, especially for newer and less familiar benchmarks, but are not universally superior to single-agent systems.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

*Giovanni Adorni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenAI transforms education by integrating AI in workflows, proposing a framework to maintain human agency: Cyber Humanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing challenges posed by AI in education, including epistemic automation and reduced human agency.

Method: Conceptualizes AI-enabled learning environments, introduces Cyber Humanism pillars, and develops case studies.

Result: Findings demonstrate enhanced epistemic agency and indicate challenges related to workload, equity, and governance.

Conclusion: Adopting cyber-humanist principles can make future education AI-integrated yet human-centric.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies two constraints on algorithmic intelligence: one limits reasoning and the other prediction, highlighting trade-offs in intelligent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the inherent computational limitations affecting reasoning and prediction capabilities in algorithmic systems.

Method: Combines formal definitions of computational constraints, including formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability, to analyze their structural effects on intelligent agents.

Result: Demonstrates that algorithmic agents cannot generally compute their maximal prediction horizon due to these computational constraints.

Conclusion: Trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis are inevitable for intelligent systems due to fundamental computational limits.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the safe deployment of black-box AI systems by creating efficient, interpretable methods that represent and understand their decision-making capabilities.

Method: The paper employs PDDL-style representations combined with Monte-Carlo tree search to generate test tasks, collect data, and refine the possible symbolic models for representing black-box AI systems.

Result: Theoretical results confirm soundness and completeness of the learned models, while experiments validate the efficiency, scope, and accuracy of the proposed methods on various black-box AI systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that PDDL-style learned models offer an interpretable way to understand black-box AI capabilities, enhancing their safe deployment and usage.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

Conclusion: This hybrid model enhances early pain forecasting, improving clinical interpretability, and has the potential to boost precision in treatment and resource efficiency in oncology care.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "CitySeeker," a novel benchmark for assessing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in urban navigation based on implicit human needs. Despite progress in this field, current VLMs show significant limitations in spatial reasoning and task completion, achieving only 21.1% success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how Vision-Language Models can interpret implicit human needs and perform dynamic urban navigation, as well as to highlight challenges in 'last-mile' navigation.

Method: The authors created "CitySeeker," a benchmark with 6,440 navigation trajectories across 8 cities, representing diverse scenarios and implicit human needs. They conducted experiments and introduced exploratory strategies such as Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval to improve VLM performance.

Result: Findings revealed that even advanced models perform poorly in task completion due to limitations in long-horizon reasoning, spatial cognition, and experiential recall.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates shortcomings in current VLMs and offers actionable insights for enhancing spatial intelligence, underlining the importance of iterative observation, reasoning, and adaptive strategies in urban navigation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

TL;DR: TOGGLE introduces a framework to compress large language models (LLMs) by using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to maintain linguistic properties while reducing computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques like quantization and pruning degrade critical linguistic properties and lack guarantees for preserving model behavior on LLMs, making deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging.

Method: The approach uses STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, enabling compression without retraining or fine-tuning while preserving linguistic properties.

Result: TOGGLE achieved up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs and up to 68.8% reduction in model size across various LLM architectures while fulfilling specified linguistic constraints.

Conclusion: TOGGLE is the first framework integrating formal methods for compressing LLMs efficiently and verifiably, ensuring compatibility with edge hardware deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

*Nenad Tomašev,Matija Franklin,Julian Jacobs,Sébastien Krier,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need to consider the 'patchwork AGI' hypothesis and proposes a framework for distributional AGI safety focusing on robust group safeguarding measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked potential risks posed by a patchwork emergence of AGI (groups of coordinated sub-AGI agents), thus ensuring comprehensive AGI safety.

Method: The authors propose a framework involving virtual sandbox economies for governing agent coordination, using market mechanisms, auditability, reputation management, and oversight.

Result: A theoretical framework is introduced to mitigate risks arising from coordinated multi-agent systems, emphasizing the necessity of group-level safeguards.

Conclusion: The study advocates for a shift in AGI safety focus from individual agents to collective, coordinated systems to address emerging risks effectively.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a framework to embed societal values and enforce responsible AI principles throughout AI system lifecycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between normative responsible AI principles and implementable, enforceable mechanisms in AI systems.

Method: The authors propose the six-layer Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) framework that integrates safeguards, constraints, interfaces, and governance processes using a closed-loop supervisory control model for socio-technical systems.

Result: Case studies demonstrate SRS's application in clinical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems to enforce values like fairness, autonomy, and explanation quality.

Conclusion: SRS provides a practical foundation for embedding ethical, adaptive, and accountable practices in AI systems by bridging ethics, control theory, and governance mechanisms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs), achieving notable performance gains on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address process errors in LLMs' mathematical reasoning, such as incorrect calculations and logical inconsistencies, by enhancing reasoning quality with a novel adversarial training approach.

Method: The method involves co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator, using adversarial reinforcement learning with a compute-efficient review schedule. The discriminator evaluates reasoning slices, delivering step-level rewards to improve logical consistency.

Result: The approach improves reasoning performance across mathematical benchmarks, with, for instance, a +7.3 improvement on AIME24 using Qwen-7B and a +10.0 improvement using Llama-8B, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: Generative Adversarial Reasoner effectively enhances LLM reasoning and is flexible for objectives like distillation, preference alignment, and proof-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

*FNU Vikas,Paul Gratz,Daniel Jiménez*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology to characterize workloads for branch prediction by introducing two identifiers—branch working set size and branch predictability—and analyzes their relationship with prediction accuracy in modern branch predictors such as TAGE and perceptron.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of branch predictors, which directly impacts performance and energy efficiency, by identifying workload characteristics strongly correlated with mispredictions in branch prediction.

Method: The authors introduce two parameters: branch working set size (a frequently occurring context tuple) and branch predictability. They categorize workload traces based on these parameters and analyze their correlation to branch prediction accuracy using modern schemes like TAGE and perceptron.

Result: The study categorized 2,451 workload traces into seven working set size and nine predictability categories, providing insights into factors affecting prediction accuracy and strengthening the understanding of branch predictors’ effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research contributes critical understanding of workload characteristics affecting branch prediction accuracy, offering a refined framework for analyzing and optimizing modern branch predictors' performance.

Abstract: Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper explores the development of wearable contextual AI systems, emphasizing the importance of a full-system approach to overcome power and design challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a new generation of always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices that support contextual AI personal assistants and applications by maintaining a user's personal context.

Method: The authors present the full system architecture of a wearable contextual AI system (Aria2) and conduct system modeling and design space exploration to derive insights.

Result: Findings show that a comprehensive system-level view is essential as power constraints and bottlenecks are distributed across multiple components.

Conclusion: A holistic system architecture approach is pivotal for designing wearable AI systems to support all-day use, requiring long-term design decisions and optimizations.

Abstract: The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human-relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.

### [60] [TabReX : Tabular Referenceless eXplainable Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15907)
*Tejas Anvekar,Juhna Park,Aparna Garimella,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabReX, a novel framework for evaluating tabular data generated by LLMs without relying on fixed references, offering interpretable metrics via graph-based reasoning. Additionally, it introduces a benchmarking suite, TabReX-Bench, demonstrating robustness and alignment with expert evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for assessing tabular data generated by LLMs either ignore meaningful structures by flattening tables or use fixed references, which hinder generalization and detailed evaluation.

Method: TabReX leverages canonical knowledge graph conversion for generated tables and source texts, aligns them using LLM-guided matching, and provides interpretable rubric-aware scores. It employs a benchmarking suite, TabReX-Bench, to validate robustness across multiple domains and perturbation types.

Result: TabReX showcases its robust correlation with expert rankings, maintains accuracy under more challenging perturbations, and enables granular analysis between models and prompts for table generation.

Conclusion: TabReX represents an innovative, explainable solution for evaluating structured generation systems, setting a new standard for trustworthiness and precision in tabular data assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.

*Joel Mire,Maria Antoniak,Steven R. Wilson,Zexin Ma,Achyutarama R. Ganti,Andrew Piper,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SocialStoryFrames, a framework and computational models to infer responses to storytelling using social media examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding reader responses to storytelling, such as intent or emotional reactions, is limited in computational models, hindering nuanced analysis.

Method: They propose the SocialStoryFrames formalism with SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier models, validated via human surveys and expert annotations, alongside a dataset of social media stories.

Result: Using the models and dataset, they analyze storytelling intents, interactions, and practices across different online communities.

Conclusion: SocialStoryFrames offer a systematic way to study context-sensitive reader responses, enabling insights into storytelling's dynamics and diversity in online platforms.

Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.

Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of unbounded natural-language token expansion in LLMs, enhancing reasoning accuracy and cost-effectiveness in autonomous systems.

Method: The paper uses BRAID, a bounded reasoning framework leveraging Mermaid-based structured instruction graphs across GPT models to optimize reasoning.

Result: BRAID increased reasoning accuracy and cost efficiency in GPT models, with results validated on AdvancedIF, GSM-Hard, and SCALE MultiChallenge datasets.

Conclusion: BRAID is an effective, scalable way to optimize reasoning efficiency in autonomous agent systems, with datasets publicly available for verification.

*Kieran Henderson,Kian Omoomi,Vasudha Varadarajan,Allison Lahnala,Charles Welch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of various types of self-disclosure information on predicting annotator labels for judgments of social norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how different types of personal information in self-disclosure sentences influence the modeling of individual characteristics and prediction accuracy for social norm annotations.

Method: Self-disclosure sentences are categorized and used to construct annotator models. Ablations and analyses are conducted to assess the impact of different types of personal information.

Result: Demographics information proved more influential than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Theory-based approaches outperformed automated clusters, and only a few related comments were required for prediction. A diverse sample of self-disclosures yielded optimal results.

Conclusion: Diverse self-disclosure and demographics significantly enhance prediction of annotator patterns for subjective tasks, with fewer related comments needed than previously expected.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of personal information in the form of persona sentences or self-disclosures to improve modeling of individual characteristics and prediction of annotator labels for subjective tasks. The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters. Contrary to previous work, only a small number of related comments are needed. Lastly, having a more diverse sample of annotator self-disclosures leads to the best performance.

### [64] [Are We on the Right Way to Assessing LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16041)
*Yuanning Feng,Sinan Wang,Zhengxiang Cheng,Yao Wan,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Sage," a new evaluation suite to assess the quality of LLMs as judges without relying on human annotations, addressing limitations like human bias and scalability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are based on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces biases and scalability issues, limiting the reliability of LLM evaluations.

Method: The authors propose Sage, using principles from rational choice theory. They introduce metrics like local self-consistency and global logical consistency. A dataset of 650 questions is created using a mix of benchmark problems and real-world queries.

Result: Sage's metrics are stable and highly correlate with supervised benchmarks. However, the top-performing models still show notable reliability issues, often failing in complex cases due to situational preferences.

Conclusion: Sage demonstrates the unreliability of both human and LLM judgments, proposing techniques (like explicit rubrics and finetuning) to improve evaluation consistency. The framework is instrumental for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge performance.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCLie and DPCLie models leveraging Lie Convolutions to improve sentence classification by handling complex linguistic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance traditional CNNs, which focus on local features but struggle with complex transformations in language modeling.

Method: Lie Convolutions are incorporated into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers to effectively model non-Euclidean symmetries in language.

Result: The proposed SCLie and DPCLie models outperformed traditional alternatives, showcasing improved accuracy in sentence classification.

Conclusion: Lie Convolutions present a promising path for capturing complex transformations in language, encouraging further language modeling innovations.

Abstract: Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks have been successful in capturing local, position-invariant features in text, but their capacity to model complex transformation within language can be further explored. In this work, we explore a novel approach by integrating Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, inspired by the ability of Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries. Our proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, suggesting that Lie-based models relatively improve the accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language. Our findings motivate more exploration of new paradigms in language modeling.

### [66] [MRG-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Clinically Aligned Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16145)
*Pengyu Wang,Shuchang Ye,Usman Naseem,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for generating more clinically accurate medical reports, outperforming current methods using a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical report generation techniques fail to ensure clinical correctness as they are overly focused on mimicking linguistic style rather than medical accuracy.

Method: The authors propose SRL, which optimizes a semantic-driven reward calculated via cosine similarity (MCCS) between key radiological findings in generated and reference reports, instead of relying on token-level objectives. It uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a reasoning format constraint for structured outputs.

Result: The proposed MRG-R1 method achieves state-of-the-art results with CE-F1 scores of 51.88 (IU X-Ray) and 40.39 (MIMIC-CXR), showing improved clinical correctness compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Optimizing semantic-level rewards rather than token overlap better aligns medical report generation models with clinical accuracy, suggesting its potential for broader application in training medical vision-language models (Med-LVLM).

Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of harmful online content propagated through fake narratives combined with hate speech.

Method: The approach applies advanced NLP techniques and domain-specific pretraining to address Binary Faux-Hate detection and Target/Severity prediction.

Result: The proposed system showcased competitive performance using multi-task learning for detecting and categorizing Faux-Hate.

Conclusion: Leveraging multi-task learning and domain-specific pretraining can effectively address and improve analysis of complex phenomena like Faux-Hate.

Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust pipeline to extract structured information from police incident posts using an advanced fine-tuned model, achieving high accuracy for various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current police incident data extraction struggles due to informal, noisy text, particularly on platforms like social media, necessitating a more efficient and accurate extraction method.

Method: A domain-adapted extraction pipeline was developed using targeted prompt engineering combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model, aided by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to process and extract 15 key fields from a large annotated dataset.

Result: The model achieved over 98.36% accuracy in mortality detection, and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% and 95.54% for fatality counts and province-level locations, respectively, demonstrating significant improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline proves effective for structured information extraction, transforming unstructured text into valuable data for social science research with validated, high-performance results.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial for timely and accurate data processing, yet presents considerable challenges due to the variability and informal nature of textual sources such as social media posts. To address these challenges, we developed a domain-adapted extraction pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020). Experimental results demonstrated that LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly improved performance over both the base and instruction-tuned models, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98.36% for mortality detection and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% for fatality counts and 95.54% for province-level location extraction. The proposed pipeline thus provides a validated and efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering a practical framework for transforming unstructured text into reliable structured data in social science research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of hallucinated outputs in large language models (LLMs) for critical healthcare applications by proposing a fact-checking module and a domain-specific summarization model that improves reliability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliability of LLM-generated outputs in critical healthcare scenarios, particularly focusing on reducing hallucination in decision-making processes where accuracy is paramount for patient safety.

Method: The authors introduce an independent fact-checking module in combination with a domain-specific summarization model. The summarization model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) techniques on the MIMIC III dataset. The fact-checking module utilizes numerical and logical tests to ensure the factual accuracy of summaries based on electronic health records.

Result: The fact-checking module achieved a precision of 0.8904, recall of 0.8234, and F1-score of 0.8556. The summarization model attained a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120, indicating high summary quality and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the reliability of LLM outputs in healthcare by effectively combining fact-checking and summarization techniques, thereby reducing hallucination and enhancing accuracy in critical contexts.

Abstract: In healthcare, it is essential for any LLM-generated output to be reliable and accurate, particularly in cases involving decision-making and patient safety. However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors or outdated information in LLMs compromise their accuracy, making it essential to adopt efficient strategies for updating these models without requiring costly full retraining processes.

Method: The proposed framework is grounded in information bottleneck theory, leveraging compressed latent representations for precise and generalized knowledge correction through gradient-based updates.

Result: The IBKE method produces state-of-the-art accuracy, achieving both improved generality and specificity of edits across various LLM architectures and benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: IBKE provides a theoretical and practical solution for open-domain knowledge editing in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoPA, an algorithm for accelerating diffusion-based large language models' inference by improving token filling order, achieving faster decoding speeds while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in the degree of parallelism during inference in diffusion-based large language models, which hamper decoding speed and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose LoPA, a training-free algorithm that explores and selects optimal token filling orders based on branch confidence and integrates branch parallelism in multi-device systems to enhance decoding.

Result: LoPA improves the token-per-forward-pass rate of the D2F-Dream model to 10.1 on GSM8K, and achieves a throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second in multi-GPU setups.

Conclusion: LoPA significantly accelerates inference in diffusion-based language models with a novel approach to token filling order, enabling higher throughput while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for high-speed inference. However, current confidence-driven decoding strategies are constrained by limited parallelism, typically achieving only 1--3 tokens per forward pass (TPF). In this work, we identify that the degree of parallelism during dLLM inference is highly sensitive to the Token Filling Order (TFO). Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sigma-MoE-Tiny, a highly sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with up to 20B parameters and efficient usage of just 0.5B activated ones, achieving top-tier performance in its category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of making foundation models scalable and efficient by leveraging sparsity and maintaining robustness in training, especially in MoE architectures.

Method: The model uses fine-grained segmentation with 96 experts per layer, activates only one expert per token, introduces a progressive sparsification schedule for load balancing, and undergoes diverse dataset pre-training and post-training for improved performance.

Result: Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves high sparsity and competitive performance, using only a fraction (0.5B) of its total parameters and maintaining stable training without irrecoverable loss spikes.

Conclusion: The proposed progressive sparsification and load balancing methodology effectively advances the sparsity field in MoE models, providing insights for future architecture designs and affirming the potential of highly sparse MoE frameworks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

Conclusion: Reasoning models are more effective for translating low-resource and endangered languages, yielding insights into their potential for language preservation efforts.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translation tasks has primarily focused on high-resource languages, leaving a significant gap in understanding their performance on low-resource and endangered languages. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models, specifically examining the differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages: Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, and Udmurt. Using a parallel corpus of literary texts, we evaluate model willingness to attempt translation through refusal rate analysis across different model architectures. Our findings reveal significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with Uralic languages and contribute to the broader understanding of reasoning model capabilities for endangered language preservation.

### [74] [Hacking Neural Evaluation Metrics with Single Hub Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16323)
*Hiroyuki Deguchi,Katsuki Chousa,Yusuke Sakai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to identify vulnerabilities in neural text evaluation metrics by discovering a single adversarial text that is consistently evaluated as high-quality across different test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliability and robustness in neural text evaluation metrics, particularly the vulnerability of these metrics due to their black-box nature.

Method: Developed a technique to find an adversarial hub text in the discrete space that scores highly on evaluation metrics regardless of source text or target test cases.

Result: Demonstrated that the hub text achieves 79.1% in COMET for English-to-Japanese and 67.8% for English-to-German tasks, surpassing translations generated individually for each sentence.

Conclusion: Highlighted significant vulnerabilities in current neural text evaluation metrics and showed that adversarial examples can generalize across multiple language pairs, emphasizing the need for more robust evaluation measures.

Abstract: Strongly human-correlated evaluation metrics serve as an essential compass for the development and improvement of generation models and must be highly reliable and robust. Recent embedding-based neural text evaluation metrics, such as COMET for translation tasks, are widely used in both research and development fields. However, there is no guarantee that they yield reliable evaluation results due to the black-box nature of neural networks. To raise concerns about the reliability and safety of such metrics, we propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in the discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality, regardless of the test cases, to identify the vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics. The single hub text found with our method achieved 79.1 COMET% and 67.8 COMET% in the WMT'24 English-to-Japanese (En--Ja) and English-to-German (En--De) translation tasks, respectively, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by using M2M100, a general translation model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the hub text found with our method generalizes across multiple language pairs such as Ja--En and De--En.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates SpeechLLMs against traditional cascaded systems in speech-to-text translation, finding cascaded systems to remain more reliable overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether SpeechLLMs, which directly translate spoken language bypassing transcription, can outperform traditional transcription-based cascaded systems in translation quality.

Method: The study benchmarks five state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against sixteen direct and cascaded systems, involving speech foundation models and multilingual LLMs, across diverse benchmarks, languages, and challenging scenarios.

Result: The evaluation found that cascaded systems are more reliable overall, while SpeechLLMs perform comparably in select settings and speech foundation models lag behind.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLLMs are not consistently superior to cascades, highlighting the need for further integration of LLMs to enhance speech translation quality.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

*Darshil Chauhan,Adityasinh Solanki,Vansh Patel,Kanav Kapoor,Ritvik Jain,Aditya Bansal,Dhruv Kumar,Prateek Narang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenges of deploying ASR in clinical settings through a privacy-preserving, efficient adaptation framework, showing significant improvement in performance and reduced catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of deploying ASR in resource-constrained clinical environments, such as privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and acoustic domain shifts, which hinder its practical applications.

Method: The authors propose a framework using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for continual learning while preserving privacy, and introduce multi-domain experience replay to minimize catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Their method achieves a 17.1% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on clinical audio and reduces catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective approach for building adaptive, privacy-respecting ASR systems capable of operating in real-world clinical settings, marking significant progress toward practical deployment.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify biomedical texts, comparing various approaches including prompting, two-agent systems, and fine-tuning, evaluated via quantitative and qualitative metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify biomedical texts and improve health literacy using AI-based solutions—addressing a significant barrier in public health communication.

Method: The study uses LLMs like OpenAI's gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini to simplify biomedical texts, developing baseline, two-agent, and fine-tuning approaches. Performance was measured via metrics, including readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG Index), SARI, BERTScore, G-Eval, and Likert scale assessments.

Result: The gpt-4o-mini model outperformed others, while fine-tuned models underperformed. The AI-based G-Eval metric aligned reasonably well with qualitative assessments.

Conclusion: The gpt-4o-mini model is effective for text simplification in biomedical fields. G-Eval shows potential as a reliable evaluation tool for such transformations.

Abstract: This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods for simplifying scientific texts at sentence and document levels using advanced AI models.

Method: The research employed gpt-4.1 models (standard, mini, and nano) with two approaches: a no-context prompt-engineering method and fine-tuned models.

Result: The gpt-4.1-mini performed well with prompt engineering, while fine-tuned models showed mixed outcomes, with gpt-4.1-nano-ft excelling in specific document-level tasks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the utility of gpt-4.1-mini for general text simplification and highlights challenges in fine-tuning for consistent performance across text granularities.

Abstract: This work describes our submission to the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track Task 1, addressing both sentenceand document-level simplification of scientific texts. The methodology centered on using the gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1mini, and gpt-4.1-nano models from OpenAI. Two distinct approaches were compared: a no-context method relying on prompt engineering and a fine-tuned (FT) method across models. The gpt-4.1-mini model with no-context demonstrated robust performance at both levels of simplification, while the fine-tuned models showed mixed results, highlighting the complexities of simplifying text at different granularities, where gpt-4.1-nano-ft performance stands out at document-level simplification in one case.

*Iker García-Ferrero,David Montero,Roman Orus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Refusal Steering, a method to control refusal behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs) on sensitive topics without retraining, achieving scalable control and retaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of controlling LLM response refusal on politically sensitive topics without compromising safety or requiring extensive retraining, ensuring nuanced, transparent moderation capabilities.

Method: The method employs an LLM-as-a-judge to compute refusal confidence scores instead of conventional pattern-based mechanisms, complemented by ridge-regularized steering vectors to isolate refusal-compliance dynamics. Analysis conducted on Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking and tested on other models.

Result: Refusal Steering successfully adjusts refusal behavior in politically sensitive areas while maintaining safety and general performance, effective across multiple models of varying sizes (4B to 80B).

Conclusion: Activation steering is a viable method for removing political refusal behavior while preserving alignment with safety goals and enabling precise moderation during inference.

Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JustRL, a minimal approach for reinforcement learning in large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing complexity and compute requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that increasing complexity is necessary for achieving high performance in reinforcement learning for large language models.

Method: The authors propose JustRL, a simplified strategy employing single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters, avoiding common complex interventions like multi-stage pipelines and dynamic schedules.

Result: JustRL achieved state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models across nine mathematical benchmarks, using 2x less compute and demonstrating stable improvement during training without plateauing.

Conclusion: This study argues against unnecessary complexity in reinforcement learning methodologies, showing that stability and performance can be achieved with simplicity, and provides an open-source baseline for further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

*William English,Chase Walker,Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GinSign, a framework for translating natural language specifications into grounded temporal logic with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable engineers to specify and verify system behaviors without manual crafting of formal specifications, enhancing the accuracy of grounded translations.

Method: GinSign employs a hierarchical decomposition of grounding tasks: predicting predicate labels followed by selecting constant arguments, using smaller masked language models rather than large language models.

Result: GinSign achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of 95.5%, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 1.4 times in experiments across multiple domains.

Conclusion: Grounding is crucial for accurate natural language-to-temporal logic translation in autonomous systems, and GinSign effectively addresses this with high accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reasoning-augmented RAG framework to handle conflicting, outdated, or subjective information in retrieved data, with significant performance improvements demonstrated in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often fails with conflicting, outdated, or subjective retrievals, and prior solutions lack unified reasoning mechanisms to address this issue comprehensively.

Method: The authors propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG consisting of three stages: document-level adjudication, conflict analysis, and grounded synthesis, combined with a Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) evaluation using LLM-based judgment.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over baselines, achieving higher correctness and behavioral adherence in responses, especially with the Qwen model.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology establishes a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems by successfully integrating structured reasoning and evaluation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

*Primož Kocbek,Azra Frkatović-Hodžić,Dora Lalić,Vivian Hui,Gordan Lauc,Gregor Štiglic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates various methods for grounded biomedical Question Answering (QA), focusing on multi-modal data retrieval and its impact on performance across varying model sizes and capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-offs between converting visual elements (e.g., figures, tables) into text versus using OCR-free visual retrieval for biomedical QA models, particularly in the challenging domain of glycobiology.

Method: A benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (stratified by retrieval difficulty) was created. Four retrieval strategies (None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and OCR-free visual retrieval) were implemented. Multiple open-source and proprietary QA models were tested, with accuracy and confidence intervals calculated based on repeated runs.

Result: Text RAG and multi-modal conversion approaches outperformed OCR-free visual retrieval for mid-sized models, while OCR-free approaches became competitive when paired with state-of-the-art models like GPT-5. Smaller retrievers (e.g., ColFlor) performed on par with heavier options.

Conclusion: Choice of retrieval strategy depends on model capacity: mid-sized models benefit from text-based conversion, while frontier models perform well with OCR-free visual retrieval. ColFlor is recommended for environments requiring efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available.

*William English,Dominic Simon,Sumit Kumar Jha,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT), for translating natural language into temporal logic, addressing challenges like limited data and co-references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in existing methods for translating natural language into temporal logic, including issues with atomic proposition lifting, co-references, and scalability with limited data.

Method: GraFT reduces the solution space for translation by restricting valid output tokens using problem-specific properties, providing a more efficient learning approach.

Result: GraFT improved end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain accuracy by 14.06% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework (GraFT) enhances translation accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness in the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks.

Abstract: Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic method to measure how much prosody conveys beyond text in communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the quantitative and qualitative information conveyed by prosody in communication beyond words.

Method: Large speech and language models are utilized to estimate mutual information between dimensions of meaning and communication channels.

Result: Audio channels, especially prosody, transmit significantly more information about sarcasm and emotion compared to text, while conveying less information about questionhood.

Conclusion: The findings suggest prosody plays a critical role in expressing sarcasm and emotion and the method can be expanded to other dimensions and contexts.

Abstract: Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMCache, a model-agnostic system to reduce transformer inference latency using layer-wise caching based on semantic similarity, showing promising results with up to 3.1x speedup and minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference latency of transformer-based language models, particularly for real-time and large-scale deployments.

Method: Introduced a novel layer-wise caching framework (LLMCache) that reuses intermediate activations based on semantic similarity and employs adaptive eviction strategies to manage stale caches.

Result: Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 show up to 3.1x improvement in inference speed with less than 0.5% accuracy degradation across several datasets.

Conclusion: LLMCache is an efficient and general-purpose solution to improve inference efficiency of transformers, applicable across different architectures without major loss in performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the balance between parametric knowledge and external searches in large language models, minimizing unnecessary tool calls and enhancing transparency and performance in critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of building LLM-based search agents that effectively balance internal knowledge with external search, avoiding overuse of searching while reducing reliance on parametric knowledge to prevent hallucination.

Method: The authors introduce AdaSearch, a two-stage RL framework that separates problem-solving from the decision to perform searches, providing explicit transparency in decision-making and overcoming inefficiencies seen in prior methods.

Result: AdaSearch enhances self-knowledge awareness of agents, significantly reduces unnecessary search calls while maintaining task performance, and offers interpretable decision-making processes.

Conclusion: AdaSearch advances adaptive LLM capabilities by improving their decision skills around using parametric knowledge versus external searches, crucial for applications in high-risk areas like finance and healthcare.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.

*Yushi Hu,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Emily Dinan,Luke Zettlemoyer,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB2, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating reward models in multimodal settings, focusing on tasks combining text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models for multimodal large language models (LLMs) that handle interleaved image-text sequences remain underexplored.

Method: MMRB2 spans four tasks with challenging prompts and expert-annotated preference pairs, using ensemble filtering for data refinement.

Result: MMRB2 reveals performance gaps in reward models, with the highest accuracy at 75-80% by Gemini 3 Pro, while humans achieve >90%.

Conclusion: MMRB2 identifies weaknesses in current reward models and correlates performance with downstream task success, offering clear areas for improvement in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.

*Eric Todd,Jannik Brinkmann,Rohit Gandikota,David Bau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how transformers develop reasoning mechanisms to solve arithmetic tasks with variable-meaning symbols, achieving nearly perfect accuracy even in challenging setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reasoning capabilities of transformers when solving tasks with symbols that vary in meaning, addressing a gap in prior work that focused on fixed-meaning tokens.

Method: The authors designed a task where symbol-to-group-element assignments change per sequence and used targeted data distributions to test specific reasoning mechanisms in transformers.

Result: Transformers achieved near-perfect accuracy and generalization to unseen algebraic groups. Three reasoning mechanisms were identified: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation.

Conclusion: Transformers develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms alongside geometric representations, enabling reasoning in dynamic contexts where variable meanings are non-fixed.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.

*Nikhil Prakash,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes a method to enhance LLM performance by updating specific sparse circuits responsible for task execution, achieving significant improvement in accuracy with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies revealed that LLM performance improvement often stems from strengthening specific circuits, suggesting the potential for targeted intervention to enhance specific tasks.

Method: The authors introduced Constructive Circuit Amplification, identifying relevant tokens and components for task-specific enhancement, and selectively updating them.

Result: Applied to mathematical reasoning tasks, the method achieved up to +11.4% accuracy improvement across models while altering only 1.59% of components. Impacts on other abilities were minimal.

Conclusion: Selective amplification of sparse circuits reliably enhances targeted capabilities without significantly affecting other functions.

Abstract: Prior studies investigating the internal workings of LLMs have uncovered sparse subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, that are responsible for performing specific tasks. Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.

*Yan Yang,George Bebis,Mircea Nicolescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in masked face detection/recognition by introducing a two-step generative data augmentation framework for creating more realistic masked-face samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome data scarcity and distribution shifts in masked face detection and recognition.

Method: A two-step generative approach combining rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image GAN-based translation. Additional techniques include non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection.

Result: The proposed method shows qualitative improvements over rule-based warping and complements existing GAN-based methods like IAMGAN.

Conclusion: The framework enhances masked-face sample generation and provides potential directions for future advancements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition.

Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Pier Luigi Dovesi,Shaghayegh Roohi,Mark Granroth-Wilding,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes JARVIS, a new framework to enhance visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with visual reasoning tasks because they learn primarily from limited textual descriptions and undergo smaller-scale multimodal training compared to text-only pre-training.

Method: The authors introduce JARVIS, which incorporates the I-JEPA learning paradigm with standard vision-language training. Frozen vision models are used as context and target encoders, while early layers of an LLM are trained to better extract visual regularities without relying solely on language supervision.

Result: JARVIS improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different language model families without compromising multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Integrating self-supervised visual learning within MLLMs training enhances their visual reasoning capabilities while preserving overall multimodal functionality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

*Dwip Dalal,Utkarsh Mishra,Narendra Ahuja,Nebojsa Jojic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation with the CityNav benchmark, focusing on evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world city navigation tasks using only visual inputs and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for MLLMs are predominantly language-based or rely on simulated environments, failing to assess knowledge-intensive reasoning required in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed solution is Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, operationalized with the CityNav benchmark across 4 cities. It tests agents' decision-making abilities based on visual inputs without environmental annotations or specialized architectures. The paper also introduces Verbalization of Path (VoP) to enhance reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs and existing reasoning methods perform poorly in this benchmark. However, VoP improves navigation success by grounding the agent's reasoning explicitly.

Conclusion: Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation and VoP offer a novel way to evaluate and improve MLLMs in practical, knowledge-intensive tasks, advancing their capabilities in real-world settings.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R4, a framework for enhancing vision-language models with structured, multimodal 4D reasoning capabilities for improved navigation and question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to mimic humans' capability of persistent multimodal memory-based reasoning in 4D space (semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions), addressing the absence of such holistic memory systems in current vision-language models.

Method: R4 constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring semantic descriptions in space and time, allowing natural language queries to interact with this memory for retrieval-based reasoning.

Result: Experiments show R4 significantly improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal data in question answering and navigation benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: R4 enables a new paradigm for collaborative reasoning in dynamic environments by establishing structured memory systems for vision-language models without requiring training.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

*Tejas Anvekar,Fenil Bardoliya,Pavan K. Turaga,Chitta Baral,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'The Perceptual Observatory,' a framework to comprehensively evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on perceptual grounding and reasoning under controlled perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns regarding whether the progress of MLLMs reflects true visual grounding or simply leverages textual world knowledge while highlighting the limitations of current evaluation methods that focus solely on end-task accuracy.

Method: The authors present evaluation verticals such as simple vision tasks, local-to-global understanding tasks, and more, leveraging ground-truth datasets with systematic perturbations to analyze MLLMs’ perceptual capabilities.

Result: The framework reveals insights into MLLMs' ability to preserve perceptual grounding and relational reasoning under various perturbations, moving beyond conventional accuracy-focused evaluations.

Conclusion: Using The Perceptual Observatory, researchers gain a principled way to evaluate and compare the strengths and weaknesses of current and future MLLMs, fostering advancements in the field of multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAMP-VLM, a framework leveraging vision language models for accurately predicting interactions of multiple humans from an observer’s perspective, achieving superior prediction accuracy through novel methods and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate human behavior prediction in multi-human, third-person scenarios, enabling mobile robots to operate effectively in human-centered environments.

Method: CAMP-VLM utilizes contextual and spatial scene features to predict human-scene interactions, fine-tuned with synthetic data from a photorealistic simulator, and validated through supervised fine-tuning and optimization techniques.

Result: CAMP-VLM significantly improves prediction accuracy, outperforming prior baselines by up to 66.9% on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of combining VLMs with synthetic data generation for multi-human behavior prediction, highlighting its benefits for robotic applications in complex environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot multispectral object detection, overcoming challenges posed by limited annotated data and demonstrating effectiveness in diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for robust multispectral object detection in safety-critical applications and the challenge of limited annotated data.

Method: The method involves adapting Vision-Language Models (Grounding DINO and YOLO-World) to process multispectral inputs with a mechanism integrating text, visual, and thermal data.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLIR and M3FD benchmarks reveal VLM-based detectors surpass specialized multispectral models in few-shot settings and are competitive under fully supervised conditions.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models provide a novel and effective approach to data-efficient multispectral object detection, leveraging semantic priors to adapt to unseen modalities.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) currently underperform supervised models in agricultural tasks and require domain-specific modifications for effective use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the reliability of VLMs for agricultural visual recognition tasks, which is critical for decision support in agriculture.

Method: Benchmarked various vision-language models (VLMs) using 27 agricultural datasets covering plant disease, pest, damage, and species identification.

Result: Zero-shot VLMs performed poorly compared to supervised models (e.g., YOLO11), with model accuracy significantly enhanced by constrained interfaces and evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are not viable as standalone diagnostic tools in agriculture but may serve as assistive components if paired with specialized modifications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robotic lawn mower system that improves garden biodiversity using deep learning and adaptive decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lawn mowing practices often reduce biodiversity, while passive rewilding approaches lack active control over ecological preservation.

Method: The system utilizes ResNet50 for extracting meaningful plant embeddings and implements a selective mowing algorithm to preserve visually diverse vegetation.

Result: The proposed framework showed strong correlation between visual diversity metrics and expert biodiversity assessments, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adopting such robotic mowing systems can transform monocultural lawns into biodiverse ecosystems, enhancing urban biodiversity.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for generating video-action pairs for robots from initial observations and joint states, addressing the lack of action labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic policy learning struggles due to limited action annotations, hindering the application of video diffusion models.

Method: The approach uses a pretrained video diffusion model, an action diffusion model, Bridge Attention for cross-modal interaction, and an action refinement module.

Result: Evaluations show improved video quality, more accurate actions, and performance metrics surpassing baselines on benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable framework to use large-scale video data, enhancing robotic learning capabilities.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a platform to generate challenging real-world scenarios and evaluate end-to-end autonomous driving models using adversarial methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of safety-critical corner cases for testing autonomous driving models in real-world scenarios.

Method: A closed-loop evaluation platform with a real-world image generator and adversarial traffic policies that simulate real-world traffic interactions for testing autonomous driving models.

Result: The platform efficiently generates realistic driving images, tests models like UniAD and VAD, and identifies performance degradations in corner cases.

Conclusion: The presented platform is effective in detecting potential issues in autonomous driving models, aiding in their safety and robustness improvements.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion model for predicting high angular resolution fiber orientation distribution (HAR-FOD) from low angular resolution diffusion MRI data (LAR-FOD), overcoming limitations of scanning time and accuracy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-shell low angular resolution dMRI methods (LAR-FOD) have accuracy challenges, while multi-shell high angular resolution approaches (HAR-FOD) require long scan times. Efficient methods are necessary to improve the prediction of HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD.

Method: The researchers developed a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model with an FOD-patch adapter using prior brain anatomy. They added a voxel-level conditional coordinating module for global comprehension and a spherical harmonic (SH) attention module to learn complex SH coefficient correlations.

Result: Their proposed method demonstrated superior performance in HAR-FOD prediction and surpassed state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the limitations in HAR-FOD estimation from LAR-FOD, presenting an efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods require user input for specifying classes during training and inference, limiting automation and flexibility.

Method: The paper proposes AV3DOD, employing semantic scores (SS) to assess generated class quality. It leverages 2D vision-language models for image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion.

Result: AV3DOD outperforms previous methods like CoDA in both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS), showing significant improvements on datasets like ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AV3DOD eliminates the need for user-specified classes, advancing 3D object detection capabilities with superior performance and semantic generalization.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

Conclusion: LAPX provides an effective solution for pose estimation that balances high accuracy, low computational cost, and edge-device compatibility.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

Motivation: Improve camera calibration by overcoming limitations of existing methods and introducing a reliable, controllable calibration environment.

Method: Uses a collimator system with angle invariance constraints and a spherical motion model, proposing closed-form and minimal-solvers for multi-image and two-image calibration.

Result: Synthetic and real-world experiments confirm the feasibility and superior performance of the method compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Offers a flexible, fast, and superior calibration method using a collimator system, advancing camera calibration practices and applications.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CattleAct, a method for detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle using single images, a breakthrough for smart livestock management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cattle behavior interaction detection is critical for livestock management but challenging due to the rarity of interactions and the lack of a comprehensive dataset.

Method: The method involves creating a data-efficient interaction detection system by learning cattle action latent spaces and fine-tuning them with contrastive learning to unify action and interaction data.

Result: CattleAct demonstrated accurate detection of cattle interactions on a large pasture, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: CattleAct offers a promising solution for robust cattle behavior analysis, supporting better cattle industry management. Open-source implementation available.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

TL;DR: The study introduces a hybrid framework combining iterative methods and deep learning for dual-spectral CT reconstruction, improving material decomposition and artifact correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance dual-spectral CT reconstruction by addressing issues such as channel imbalance and artifacts, aiming for more accurate and clean visual results.

Method: The hybrid framework consists of a knowledge-driven module using oblique projection modification technique for intermediate reconstruction, and a data-driven module leveraging ResDynUNet++, a refined neural network based on UNet++ architecture.

Result: The hybrid approach demonstrated superior performance in reconstructing basis material images and reducing artifacts in experiments conducted on synthetic and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating iterative and deep learning methods improves DSCT reconstruction quality, showcasing both efficiency and precision for clinical applications.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

TL;DR: This research introduces a framework, SegGraph, for effective few-shot 3D part segmentation leveraging SAM-based segmentation graphs and geometric structure encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in effectively aggregating 2D knowledge from foundation models into 3D segmentation tasks and handling challenges of under-segmentation and inconsistent labels.

Method: SegGraph utilizes SAM-based segment graphs, modeling spatial relations (overlap/adjacency) between nodes, adaptive feature modulation, and a novel view-direction-weighted fusion for mapping segment features to 3D points.

Result: Outperforms competing baselines by at least 6.9% mIoU on PartNet-E dataset with strong performance on small parts and boundaries.

Conclusion: SegGraph effectively enables few-shot 3D part segmentation by addressing geometric structure encoding and semantic consistency issues.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-DGPA, an approach tackling domain discrepancies in unsupervised domain adaptation via dual alignment strategies, improving results in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), particularly their inability to effectively handle both marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies, leading to poor domain-invariant and semantic alignment.

Method: The paper proposes C-DGPA, which integrates dual-branch architecture. One branch employs adversarial training for marginal distribution alignment, and another uses a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) for conditional distribution alignment, improving semantic consistency and reducing reliance on the source domain.

Result: C-DGPA achieves state-of-the-art performance on UDA benchmarks like OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Dual alignment strategies in prompt learning for VLMs effectively address domain discrepancies in UDA and achieve superior semantic and discriminative representation.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

Motivation: Traditional cameras suffer from performance issues due to domain gaps, especially in varying lighting conditions like day-night differences.

Method: The study investigates how event cameras reduce lighting condition domain gaps and compares their effectiveness against grayscale frames.

Result: Event cameras show more consistent performance across lighting conditions, with smaller domain-shift penalties and better cross-domain baseline performance.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a viable alternative to traditional cameras for end-to-end driving in varying lighting conditions, effectively mitigating the domain gap issue without adjustments.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VALOR, a reinforcement learning-based framework to improve radiology report generation by addressing hallucinations and enhancing visual grounding and clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods for radiology report generation face challenges such as hallucinations due to poor cross-modal alignment between visual and language representations, reliance on large labeled datasets, and costly task-specific data.

Method: VALOR uses Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO) in a two-stage reinforcement learning framework to train medical vision-language models. Stage 1 improves textual precision, while Stage 2 aligns the vision module with disease findings for better image-based diagnostics.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks reveal that VALOR significantly boosts factual accuracy and visual alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in radiology report generation.

Conclusion: VALOR addresses key limitations in radiology report generation by improving cross-modal alignment and enhancing factual and clinical grounding, making substantial progress in automated medical workflows.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need adaptive categorization for dynamically evolving tasks, requiring semantic extension and visual clustering of ad-hoc categories.

Method: The OAK model uses learnable context tokens with a frozen CLIP optimized for image-text alignment and visual clustering objectives.

Result: OAK achieves superior accuracy (e.g., 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood dataset) and interpretable saliency maps, surpassing prior models like CLIP and GCD.

Conclusion: OAK enhances adaptive visual categorization, offering transparency, goal-specific classification, and generalizable performance.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for 3D point cloud comparison using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold, proposing a more stable distance metric (MSKL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional geometric metrics and existing KL divergence approximations, which fail to capture global structure or face numerical instability in comparing 3D point clouds.

Method: Represent point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models on a statistical manifold and propose Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence, stable and bounded for GMM comparisons.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MPI-FAUST and G-PCD confirm MSKL's superiority in providing stable, monotonic, and geometrically meaningful results over traditional metrics and KL approximations.

Conclusion: MSKL divergence is a stable, reliable framework for analyzing 3D point cloud geometry, outperforming current methods in statistical and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for improving single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) using a noise transformation method to enhance result quality via an encoder-decoder network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view NVS models using diffusion techniques often suffer from inconsistent outcomes due to the variability in the quality of initial noise patterns.

Method: The authors designed a discretized Euler inversion method to add image semantics to random noise and created a dataset of paired random and high-quality noise. Additionally, they developed an encoder-decoder network (EDN) to convert random noise into improved-quality noise.

Result: Plugging the proposed EDN into NVS models like SV3D and MV-Adapter resulted in significant performance boosts across various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed EDN framework effectively enhances NVS models, paving the way for more reliable single-view novel view synthesis. Code is openly provided for further use and exploration.

Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SNOW, a novel framework for 4D scene understanding that integrates Vision-Language Models with 3D geometric and temporal data, facilitating improved autonomous robotic navigation and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Vision-Language Models in understanding 3D geometry and temporal dynamics and the semantic sparsity of geometric perception models for autonomous robot systems in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed SNOW framework fuses VLM-derived semantics with 3D point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. It uses HDBSCAN clustering for object proposals, SAM2-based segmentation, and Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP) for generating multimodal tokens integrated into a 4D Scene Graph. A SLAM backend ensures spatial anchoring while maintaining temporal and spatial consistency.

Result: SNOW achieves new state-of-the-art performance in unified 4D scene understanding tasks, particularly in spatially grounded inference and multimodal integration, as validated across diverse experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: SNOW successfully integrates semantic, geometric, and temporal data into a unified framework, advancing 4D scene understanding and setting a foundation for improved embodied reasoning and autonomous robotic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

### [119] [Image Compression Using Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16226)
*Justin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates using Singular Value Decomposition for image compression but finds it less efficient than industry standards like JPEG and WEBP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore efficient image compression methods for reducing storage and bandwidth demands, focusing on low-rank matrix approximations.

Method: Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank approximations with performance evaluated through relative Frobenius error and compression ratio.

Result: Low-rank matrix approximations retain visual similarity but are less efficient in compression compared to JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP.

Conclusion: Singular Value Decomposition is not competitive for practical image compression at low error levels as compressed sizes can exceed original image sizes.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

### [120] [GeoPredict: Leveraging Predictive Kinematics and 3D Gaussian Geometry for Precise VLA Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16811)
*Jingjing Qian,Boyao Han,Chen Shi,Lei Xiao,Long Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoPredict, a geometry-aware Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that improves robotic manipulation, especially in geometry-dependent and complex spatial scenarios, using predictive 3D modules without requiring 3D decoding during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on generalization but are limited due to their reactive nature and reliance on 2D reasoning, which hinders their performance in complex 3D-oriented tasks.

Method: The proposed GeoPredict framework enhances VLA models by integrating trajectory-level modules for motion history and multi-step 3D trajectory prediction, alongside a 3D Gaussian geometry module for workspace forecasting. Training involves depth-based rendering, while inference uses additional query tokens without requiring 3D decoding.

Result: GeoPredict shows superior performance over existing VLA baselines in experiments on the RoboCasa Human-50 and LIBERO benchmarks, as well as real-world manipulation tasks, particularly in spatially and geometrically complex scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that incorporating predictive geometric and kinematic priors can significantly improve VLA models for robotic manipulation, achieving better spatial reasoning capabilities while maintaining efficiency during inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARMFlow addresses key challenges of 3D human motion generation by combining high fidelity, real-time inference, and autoregressive adaptability in online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human reaction generation methods fail to simultaneously achieve high motion fidelity, real-time inference, and adaptability for online scenarios.

Method: ARMFlow uses MeanFlow-based framework with a causal context encoder and MLP-based velocity predictor, alongside Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) for autoregressive training.

Result: ARMFlow outperforms existing online methods, surpassing them by 40% in FID on benchmarks like InterHuman and InterX. It also competes with offline state-of-the-art methods using partial conditions.

Conclusion: ARMFlow successfully improves semantic alignment, inference accuracy, and reduces error accumulation, addressing limitations in 3D motion generation for both online and offline scenarios.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction by providing researchers with a robust multimodal dataset that combines tactile, visual, and pose data for real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors created OpenTouch, a dataset consisting of 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 annotated clips, along with introducing benchmarks for retrieval and classification.

Result: The dataset and benchmarks highlight how tactile signals enhance grasp understanding, improve cross-modal alignment, and allow tactile information retrieval from egocentric videos.

Conclusion: Releasing OpenTouch aims to propel research in multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and robotic manipulation in tactile-rich environments.

Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for 3D hand trajectory prediction suffer from lack of semantic supervision in data and weak linkage between reasoning and action.

Method: Develop the EgoMAN dataset with extensive 3D trajectories and structured QA pairs, along with the EgoMAN model that integrates reasoning-to-motion using trajectory-token interface.

Result: Improved, stage-aware, and accurate trajectory prediction that generalizes well to real-world environments.

Conclusion: The integration of reasoning and motion dynamics enables better trajectory prediction with real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.

### [125] [Semi-Supervised Multi-View Crowd Counting by Ranking Multi-View Fusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16243)
*Qi Zhang,Yunfei Gong,Zhidan Xie,Zhizi Wang,Antoni B. Chan,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of limited multi-view datasets for crowd counting by proposing two semi-supervised frameworks that rank multi-view fusion models based on predictions or uncertainties, improving multi-view counting with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of annotated multi-view datasets for crowd counting in large-scale scenarios due to the difficulty in data collection and annotation.

Method: Two semi-supervised frameworks are developed: (1) Ranking based on multi-view fusion models' predictions, ensuring predictions with fewer views are not larger than those with more views; (2) Ranking based on uncertainty estimations, where models with more views have lower uncertainty. Both methods use semi-supervised constraints for training.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the proposed ranking-based methods outperform other semi-supervised counting approaches using limited labeled multi-view data for crowd counting.

Conclusion: The introduced frameworks effectively improve multi-view crowd counting in data-scarce conditions, indicating their potential to be a solution for handling limited labeled multi-view datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MomaGraph, a novel scene representation for mobile manipulators, along with a dataset, evaluation suite, and a trained model for task-oriented scene graph prediction, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing scene representations that lack integration of spatial-functional relations, dynamic updates, and task-relevant information for household mobile manipulators.

Method: Developed a unified scene representation (MomaGraph), created a large-scale dataset (MomaGraph-Scenes), and designed an evaluation suite (MomaGraph-Bench). Trained MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model, using reinforcement learning for task-oriented scene graph prediction.

Result: The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance with 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark, outperforming baselines by 11.4%. It also generalized well across public benchmarks and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: MomaGraph successfully integrates spatial-functional relationships and task-driven reasoning, providing a new standard for scene representation, task planning, and achieving notable improvements over prior approaches.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

TL;DR: Researchers introduced FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning framework allowing fast, high-resolution FLIM imaging by reconstructing high-resolution images with low spatial data inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of FLIM is limited by trade-offs between resolution, speed, and signal-to-noise ratio, demanding a solution to enhance its efficiency for real-time and label-free diagnostics.

Method: The authors developed FLIM_PSR_k using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework to achieve multi-channel pixel super-resolution for FLIM images, improving speed and reducing noise.

Result: FLIM_PSR_k demonstrated a five-fold super-resolution factor with 25-fold improvement in space-bandwidth product, revealing lost details in tumor samples and improving various image quality metrics.

Conclusion: FLIM_PSR_k significantly enhances FLIM imaging capabilities, paving the way for faster, high-resolution, hardware-flexible, and translational diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextEditBench, a benchmark for evaluating text editing in images, focusing on semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence, and highlights the limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of editing text within images while maintaining legibility, coherence, and reasoning capabilities.

Method: A benchmark called TextEditBench is developed, emphasizing reasoning-intensive text editing and introducing a evaluation metric called Semantic Expectation (SE) to assess semantic consistency and cross-modal alignment.

Result: Experimentation reveals that current models struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration during text editing.

Conclusion: TextEditBench establishes a much-needed testing framework to advance the development of text-guided image editing and semantic reasoning in multimodal generation.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DVGT, a model that reconstructs dense 3D scene geometry from visual inputs without relying on precise camera parameters, targeting autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no driving-specific dense geometry perception model that adapts to varied scenarios and camera setups.

Method: DVGT extracts visual features with a DINO backbone, uses attention mechanisms across views and frames, and decodes a global point map and ego poses, without requiring 3D priors.

Result: DVGT outperforms existing methods in dense 3D geometry reconstruction across multiple driving datasets.

Conclusion: DVGT enables flexible scene geometry reconstruction, suitable for diverse autonomous driving scenarios, marking significant advancement over conventional models.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/wzzheng/DVGT.

*Mohamed Abouagour,Eleftherios Garyfallidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GFLAN, a two-stage generative framework for automated floor plan generation, explicitly separating topological planning from geometric realization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of architectural reasoning in automated floor plan generation, including topological relationships, functional constraints, and circulation patterns.

Method: GFLAN is a two-stage approach: Stage A uses convolutional networks to allocate room centroids, and Stage B employs a Transformer-augmented graph neural network to define room boundaries.

Result: The framework prioritizes architectural reasoning, explicitly factoring topology over geometry, overcoming limitations faced by other deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Explicit factorization into topological and geometric stages improves automated floor plan generation by capturing architectural reasoning and functional design constraints.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

Conclusion: MACL effectively addresses challenges in multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval and improves performance, with resources like code and models made available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives. Code, pretrained models, and evaluation scripts will be released at https://github.com/amna/MACL upon acceptance.

Result: The Gemini 3 Pro Image model demonstrates emergent image generation capabilities with high-quality semantic mask generation under zero-shot conditions.

Conclusion: This research underscores progress in multi-modal image generation, offering insights for future studies on multimodality, reasoning, interpretability, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models that have image output are emerging. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to multimodality, reasoning, interpretability and benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaverNet, a compact lightweight video restoration network addressing time-varying degradations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the challenges of time-varying degradations in video restoration without relying on large models.

Method: Proposes LaverNet, a 362K-parameter network using a propagation mechanism to focus on degradation-agnostic features for effective temporal modeling.

Result: LaverNet achieves comparable or superior performance across benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters than existing models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that strong all-in-one video restoration is achievable with a small, efficient network like LaverNet.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

Motivation: To address instability and low robustness caused by multicollinearity in localization algorithms under limited observation conditions, and to improve target localization using UAV-mounted sensors.

Method: The fusion localization method combines the sequential imagery's rich scene information with the laser ranging's high accuracy and employs ridge estimation to handle multicollinearity issues.

Result: The proposed method improves localization accuracy compared to single-information algorithms and enhances robustness under challenging observation conditions.

Conclusion: Using ridge estimation within the proposed fusion localization method significantly improves both accuracy and robustness for UAV-based target tracking, especially in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

*Nan Zhou,Zuxin Li,Fanhang Man,Xuecheng Chen,Susu Xu,Fan Dang,Chaopeng Hong,Yunhao Liu,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Xinlei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QUIDS, a dispatching system for vehicular crowdsensing that optimizes Quality of Information (QoI) by improving coverage and reliability, achieving significant improvements in sensing quality and map accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize vehicular crowdsensing systems for quality, coverage, and reliability under dynamic participation and budget constraints.

Method: The paper introduces QUIDS with Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ) and a belief-aware vehicle dispatching algorithm that allocates incentives effectively under uncertainty.

Result: QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching methods and 10% over state-of-the-art ones, while reducing map errors by 39-74%.

Conclusion: QUIDS demonstrates cost-effective, high-quality urban monitoring by coordinating vehicles, making it highly suitable for smart-city applications like traffic and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

### [136] [Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349)
*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to optimize resource use in vision-language model inference by reducing communication costs and maintaining accuracy. This is done through selective image retransmission based on confidence measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the accuracy degradation caused by resizing images at edge devices and reduce communication costs in VLM deployments.

Method: A two-stage framework is introduced: the server performs initial inference on a resized global image, computes confidence using min-entropy, and requests detail-rich image retransmission for regions of interest only when needed. It then integrates the global and local images for refining inference.

Result: Experiments show reduced communication costs across different VLM architectures without compromising inference accuracy.

Conclusion: The collaborative edge-to-server method proves effective for reducing resource consumption while sustaining high inference performance in VLMs.

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

*Tao Hu,Weiyu Zhou,Yanjie Tu,Peng Wu,Wei Dong,Qingsen Yan,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMODiff introduces a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework to address challenges in HDR reconstruction using Latent Diffusion Models, boosting speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in applying pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to HDR reconstruction, specifically dynamic range restrictions, inference costs, and content hallucination.

Method: The proposed method reformulates HDR reconstruction as a guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, initializes denoising from an informative regression-based estimate, and integrates regression priors to enhance structural accuracy with reduced hallucinations.

Result: GMODiff shows superior performance in HDR reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving faster computational efficiency (100×) than previous LDM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The GMODiff framework addresses critical challenges in HDR reconstruction, offering an effective balance of fidelity, perceptual quality, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

*Haotian Ling,Zequn Chen,Qiuying Chen,Donglin Di,Yongjia Ma,Hao Li,Chen Wei,Zhulin Tao,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EverybodyDance introduces solutions to ensure Identity Correspondence correctness in multi-character pose-driven animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-character animations face challenges in maintaining Identity Correspondence, especially during position swaps.

Method: EverybodyDance uses Identity Matching Graphs with Mask-Query Attention to enforce IC correctness, augmented by new strategies like identity-embedded guidance.

Result: The approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in Identity Correspondence accuracy and visual animation quality.

Conclusion: EverybodyDance effectively addresses challenges in multi-character animation, establishing advancements in IC and visual fidelity benchmarks.

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

*Mariam Hassan,Bastien Van Delft,Wuyang Li,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a novel pipeline for improving Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by decomposing the process into three specialized stages for better scene composition and logical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video diffusion models often fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions, primarily due to errors in constructing a semantically correct initial frame.

Method: The FVG pipeline consists of three stages: (1) Reasoning using a Large Language Model to refine the initial prompt, (2) Composition for generating an anchor frame with a Text-to-Image model, and (3) Temporal Synthesis using a video model finetuned on the anchor frame to animate scenes.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the T2V CompBench benchmark, improves models on VBench2, and reduces sampling steps by 70% without loss in performance.

Conclusion: Factorized Video Generation is a practical method for improving efficiency, robustness, and control in Text-to-Video synthesis.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

TL;DR: AFDAN is a domain adaptation network for medical image segmentation aiming to tackle annotated data scarcity by aligning features in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in medical image segmentation arise due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, as manual annotations are labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: AFDAN incorporates an Adversarial Domain Learning Module, a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module, and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve segmentation accuracy.

Result: AFDAN achieves high segmentation performance with IoUs of 90.9% on the VITILIGO2025 dataset and 82.6% on the DRIVE benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed AFDAN framework effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances segmentation accuracy by leveraging frequency domain alignment in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Haodi He,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reconstruct human facial geometry and texture from a small set of uncalibrated images using Gaussian Splatting, enabling high-quality integration with standard graphics pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified and consistent representation of human faces from uncalibrated images using fewer inputs while being adaptable to standard graphics pipelines.

Method: The approach leverages Gaussian Splatting with segmentation alignment and triangulated surfaces to reconstruct a neutral pose from 11 images. It introduces texture-space transformations enabling high visual fidelity and compatibility with graphics pipelines, despite disparate image sources and varying lighting.

Result: Achieves accurate geometric and texture representations of faces that can be directly used in rendering pipelines without modifying assets or environments. Enables text-driven asset creation by effectively visualizing complex scenes.

Conclusion: The study bridges computer vision and graphics rendering, achieving efficient and visually accurate facial reconstruction, while providing flexibility with disparate inputs and existing pipelines.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

*Liyuan Deng,Hao Guo,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Huaxi Huang,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrepLLM, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and reason over 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models using a hierarchical encoder, contrastive learning, and progressive training methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current token-sequence-based LLMs cannot process complex geometric and topological data inherent in 3D Boundary Representation models, and this research aims to bridge the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language.

Method: BrepLLM uses a two-stage pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training converts Breps into graphs and aligns tokens with text embeddings via contrastive learning; and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning with semantic mapping, LLM fine-tuning, and Mixture-of-Query Experts for enhanced modeling.

Result: BrepLLM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D object classification and captioning tasks using the newly constructed dataset, Brep2Text, with 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs.

Conclusion: The study presents BrepLLM as a novel framework allowing LLMs to process raw Breps, making significant strides in connecting 3D geometry with natural language and improving task performance.

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountZES, a training-free framework for zero-shot object counting, which improves exemplar selection across various datasets and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object counting methods struggle with accurately isolating single-object exemplars from complex scenes, especially with unseen categories, relying on either multi-instance detectors or inefficient patch sampling.

Method: The method, CountZES, consists of three stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE) for refining detections, Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE) for density-driven exemplar identification, and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE) for clustering based on feature coherence.

Result: CountZES outperforms other zero-shot object counting methods on diverse datasets, showcasing better generalization across natural, aerial, and medical domains.

Conclusion: CountZES provides a robust, training-free approach to zero-shot object counting by effectively isolating complementary exemplars, balancing textual grounding, consistency, and representativeness.

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free method to address subject inconsistency and semantic entanglement in text-to-image diffusion models for storytelling, achieving better subject consistency and text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, especially in visual storytelling. Existing methods are computationally intensive and inefficient, motivating the need for a training-free and effective solution.

Method: The authors refine text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics from a geometric perspective, avoiding the semantic leakage and entanglement issues faced by existing approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed method outperforms baselines in maintaining subject consistency and achieving better text alignment.

Conclusion: The training-free approach offers a simple yet effective solution to semantic entanglement, improving the practicality of text-to-image models in visual storytelling scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses human motion generation by developing a text-conditioned diffusion-based model. It concentrates on realistic gaze-primed motion sequences for approaching an object/location and demonstrates promising evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the complex task of generating realistic human motions, focusing particularly on gaze-primed behavior, which reflects natural human actions during object or location interaction.

Method: The authors curate 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences from five datasets and leverage a text-conditioned diffusion-based model, fine-tuned for goal pose and location generation.

Result: The model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success in mimicking natural human gaze-primed motions, particularly on the HD-EPIC dataset.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates notable improvement in generating realistic motion sequences, with reliable evaluation metrics suggesting successful replication of gaze-primed human behaviors.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR is a novel framework for accelerating Visual Autoregressive image generation models by focusing on stages' relevance, achieving significant speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Autoregressive models enable high-quality image generation but suffer from increased computational complexity and time, particularly at large-scale steps.

Method: StageVAR systematically analyzes the importance of different stages during image generation, preserving early steps critical for semantics, while pruning or approximating late steps leveraging semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties without extra training.

Result: StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with minimal decreases in quality metrics like GenEval (0.01 drop) and DPG (0.26 decrease), outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

Conclusion: Stage-aware designs efficiently accelerate the image generation process while maintaining high quality, presenting a promising principle for VAR model optimization.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on advancing Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) by incorporating human-like perception and self-consistent reasoning using reinforcement learning and human annotation-based rewards, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to replicate and integrate human-like perception and reasoning processes into BIQA systems for better quality predictions and explainability.

Method: The authors collected human evaluation data reflecting perception and reasoning, applied reinforcement learning using human annotations as rewards, and introduced a self-consistency reasoning enhancement mechanism using self-generated descriptions.

Result: The proposed method achieved competitive image quality prediction performance, with Pearson and Spearman correlations comparable to state-of-the-art methods, and a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512, showing improved alignment with human perception chains.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a step forward in BIQA by aligning models with human-like reasoning, improving both quality prediction accuracy and interpretability through self-consistent reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

*Kejun Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Lin Wei,Chang Tang,Yibing Zhan,Zijing Chen,Zhe Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset and a Transformer model (EMERT) to bridge the gap between facial expression recognition (FER) and emotion recognition (ER) by incorporating eye behavior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expressions often serve as social tools rather than conveying genuine inner emotions. The study aims to address the gap between FER and ER by integrating additional emotional cues like eye behaviors.

Method: The researchers collected multimodal data, including eye movement and fixation patterns along with facial expressions, under spontaneous emotion induction paradigms. They developed EMERT, a Transformer-based model, utilizing modality-adversarial decoupling and multitask mechanisms to enhance emotion recognition.

Result: EMERT demonstrated superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art multimodal methods, affirming the significance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER.

Conclusion: This work highlights the critical role of eye behaviors in ER, bridging FER and ER gaps, and advancing the domain of emotion recognition systematically. The publicly shared dataset and trained models aim to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

*Huma Hafeez,Matthew Garratt,Jo Plested,Sankaran Iyer,Arcot Sowmya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO11-4K, a real-time detection framework optimized for 4K panoramic images, achieving high efficiency and precision in object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of object detection in 360-degree images, which suffer from distortions, high resolutions, and computational constraints faced by traditional methods like YOLO.

Method: The architecture uses a multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer for small object sensitivity and a GhostConv backbone to reduce computational complexity. The work also includes manual annotation of the CVIP360 dataset for benchmarking.

Result: YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with a reduced latency of 28.3 milliseconds, showing significant improvement over YOLO11 in accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: YOLO11-4K effectively addresses the challenges of detecting objects in expansive 360-degree environments, making it well-suited for high-resolution applications like autonomous navigation and surveillance.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

### [150] [PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Network for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16494)
*Mengyuan Liu,Jiajie Liu,Jinyan Zhang,Wenhao Li,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents PoseMoE, a novel monocular 3D human pose estimation method using a Mixture-of-Experts network to refine 2D pose features and depth, addressing limitations of existing lifting-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the entanglement of 2D pose and depth features, which limits accuracy in monocular 3D pose estimation methods, and improve depth refinement during estimation.

Method: The proposed PoseMoE network uses specialized expert modules for separate refinement of 2D pose and depth features and employs a cross-expert knowledge aggregation module for bidirectional enhancement of feature interaction.

Result: PoseMoE demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional methods on datasets Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: Disentangling 2D pose and depth encoding improves the accuracy of monocular 3D human pose estimation, with PoseMoE proving beneficial by refining depth features and leveraging spatial-temporal interactions.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VenusBench-GD, a bilingual, comprehensive benchmark for GUI grounding tasks across multiple platforms, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing GUI grounding benchmarks, such as insufficient data, narrow domain coverage, and single-platform focus, and to provide a resource suitable for evaluating real-world applications.

Method: The researchers created VenusBench-GD, a large-scale cross-platform benchmark with rich annotations and proposed a hierarchical taxonomy for GUI grounding tasks. They also set up a high-quality data pipeline for accurate annotations.

Result: Experiments showed general-purpose multimodal models performing well on basic tasks, while advanced tasks favored GUI-specialized models that exhibited overfitting and low robustness.

Conclusion: VenusBench-GD highlights the need for comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks to advance GUI grounding research.

Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

*Qiushuo Cheng,Jingjing Liu,Catherine Morgan,Alan Whone,Majid Mirmehdi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new self-supervised pretraining method tailored for skeleton-based temporal action localization, incorporating snippet discrimination and a U-shaped feature fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing success of self-supervised learning for skeleton-based action recognition doesn't translate well to action localization due to the need for temporally sensitive features.

Method: The method involves a snippet discrimination task for pretraining to identify differences in non-overlapping skeleton sequence segments and utilizes a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution.

Result: The proposed method improves skeleton-based contrastive learning performance on BABEL and achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on PKUMMD when pretrained with NTU RGB+D and BABEL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenges in skeleton-based temporal action localization by introducing a new pretraining task and effective feature fusion, achieving improved performance across datasets.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a weakly supervised AI approach using Grad-CAM for pneumonia diagnosis from chest X-rays without requiring pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-level annotations for pneumonia localization in X-ray images are costly and time-consuming to procure, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: The study utilizes a weakly supervised deep learning framework using Grad-CAM and image-level labels to produce heatmaps highlighting pneumonia-affected regions. It compares performance across seven pre-trained models using focal loss and patient-wise splits.

Result: The models achieved high classification accuracy (96–98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 displaying top overall performance. Grad-CAM generated clinically relevant heatmaps.

Conclusion: Weakly supervised and explainable AI models potentially improve clinical trust and transparency in pneumonia detection, offering an efficient alternative to detailed annotations.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGINet introduces multi-scale attention for intrinsic decomposition of face images, achieving state-of-the-art results for diffuse albedo estimation and rendering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate approach for intrinsic decomposition of face images for applications like photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and AR effects under unconstrained lighting conditions.

Method: MAGINet utilizes hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention, adaptive multi-scale feature fusion, and a refinement step, coupled with Pix2PixHD-based translation for rendering passes. Loss functions include masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS.

Result: MAGINet achieves sharper boundaries, strong lighting invariance, and improved fidelity in intrinsic decomposition, outperforming prior methods in albedo estimation and rendering passes.

Conclusion: MAGINet's robust intrinsic decomposition model advances the capabilities in face relighting and material editing, setting a new benchmark for rendering quality.

Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

### [155] [TTP: Test-Time Padding for Adversarial Detection and Robust Adaptation on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16523)
*Zhiwei Li,Yitian Pang,Weining Wang,Zhenan Sun,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-Time Padding (TTP), a defense framework for Vision-Language Models that detects adversarial inputs and improves their robustness without retraining or requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models like CLIP struggle with adversarial perturbations, risking applications in safety-critical contexts. Current solutions fail to balance adversarial robustness and clean accuracy effectively.

Method: Test-Time Padding identifies adversarial inputs via cosine similarity shifts in embeddings before and after spatial padding and applies adaptive trainable padding and ensemble techniques for adversarial cases.

Result: Experiments on various CLIP architectures demonstrate that TTP achieves superior adversarial robustness without compromising on clean input accuracy compared to state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: TTP presents an efficient, reliable solution to improve the adversarial robustness of Vision-Language Models, making them more suitable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

*Yuxin Wang,Lei Ke,Boqiang Zhang,Tianyuan Qu,Hanxun Yu,Zhenpeng Huang,Meng Yu,Dan Xu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces N3D-VLM, a novel framework integrating 3D object perception and reasoning, for improved spatial understanding in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models currently lack intrinsic 3D perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes.

Method: The paper proposes a framework with native 3D object perception, enabling precise localization and 3D reasoning, supported by a scalable pipeline for lifting 2D annotations to 3D space and generating diverse datasets.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D grounding tasks and outperforms existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D object perception and reasoning enhances spatial understanding in multimodal models, advancing both object localization and spatial reasoning.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for dynamically reconstructing complete scenes from monocular RGB video, including previously visible parts, using 3D primitives and motion extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to enable high-quality dynamic reconstructions of scenes, including spatial and temporal awareness, from casual video input for applications such as object permanence and multi-object tracking.

Method: The method involves decomposing the scene into rigid 3D primitives and estimating their motion using dense 2D correspondences and an optimization pipeline. Motion extrapolation techniques are used for invisible objects.

Result: The system achieves 4D spatio-temporal scene reconstruction, significantly outperforming existing methods on object scanning and multi-object datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: This approach enhances reconstruction capabilities by allowing the replay of dynamically moving scenes in 4D, promoting applications like articulated object tracking and better scene understanding.

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [158] [Causal-Tune: Mining Causal Factors from Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16567)
*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fine-tuning strategy called Causal-Tune to improve the generalization of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) by identifying and disentangling causal and non-causal components in features using frequency spectrum analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFMs exhibit artifacts caused by non-causal factors which hinder their performance in cross-domain tasks. The motivation is to address these issues for better domain generalization in semantic segmentation.

Method: The authors introduce Causal-Tune, which uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to extract the frequency spectrum of features. Causal and non-causal components are separated using a Gaussian band-pass filter. Learnable tokens further refine causal components, and the features are then reconstructed and passed to subsequent layers.

Result: Causal-Tune significantly improves performance on diverse cross-domain tasks, particularly under adverse weather conditions, achieving a +4.8% mIoU improvement in snow conditions compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Causal-Tune helps VFMs focus on causal features while suppressing non-causal artifacts, resulting in more robust domain generalization in semantic segmentation tasks, especially in challenging environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

TL;DR: CRONOS is a framework for forecasting 3D medical scans evolution over time, allowing voxel-level prediction under irregular sampling and continuous timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are limited in forecasting 3D medical scans due to reliance on single prior scans, fixed grid times, or target global labels.

Method: CRONOS operates by learning a spatio-temporal velocity field to predict contextualized volumes at arbitrary times directly in 3D voxel space, supporting discrete and continuous timestamps.

Result: CRONOS demonstrated superior performance over baselines across three datasets (Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, longitudinal MRI) while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CRONOS showcases effective continuous-time, multi-context forecasting, enabling reproducible benchmarking with its open-source code and protocols.

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

*Jintao Tong,Jiaqi Gu,Yujing Lou,Lubin Fan,Yixiong Zou,Yue Wu,Jieping Ye,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for multimodal reasoning that combines visual and textual imagination during reasoning by inserting latent visual tokens into an MLLM's unified reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the shortcomings of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in tasks that demand visual imagination, unlike humans, who can flexibly integrate visual and textual thinking in a unified cognitive space.

Method: The researchers propose SkiLa, a mechanism that enables MLLMs to switch dynamically between textual and visual thinking modes by generating visual embeddings called latent sketch tokens. A visual semantics reconstruction mechanism ensures these visual tokens are semantically grounded.

Result: Experiments show that SkiLa excels at vision-focused tasks and generalizes well to various multimodal benchmarks, highlighting its superior performance and versatility.

Conclusion: The proposed SkiLa framework significantly enhances MLLM capabilities by offering a unified and flexible approach to multimodal reasoning, reinforcing its potential for advancing AI's understanding of vision-centric tasks alongside other modalities.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Yuan-TecSwin, a diffusion model replacing CNN with Swin-transformer blocks for better long-range semantic understanding in image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in modeling long-range semantic information in diffusion models for image synthesis.

Method: The method involves substituting CNN blocks with Swin-transformer blocks in the diffusion model's architecture, improving text-image alignment with a refined text encoder, and optimizing inference using an adapted time step strategy.

Result: Yuan-TecSwin achieved state-of-the-art results with an FID score of 1.37 on the ImageNet benchmark. Its generated images were difficult for humans to distinguish from real ones.

Conclusion: Replacing CNN blocks with Swin-transformer and optimizing the text conditioning and inference strategies lead to significant improvements in image synthesis quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

### [163] [Trainable Log-linear Sparse Attention for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16615)
*Yifan Zhou,Zeqi Xiao,Tianyi Wei,Shuai Yang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a mechanism that reduces attention costs in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) from quadratic to log-linear, enabling efficient processing of long token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of self-attention in Diffusion Transformers limits their scalability to longer token sequences, and previous sparse attention attempts are inefficient for hierarchical global structure representation.

Method: LLSA employs a hierarchical Top-K sparse attention mechanism, with a Hierarchical KV Enrichment feature, to reduce computation complexity while preserving global context during attention computation.

Result: LLSA achieves a 28.27x speed-up in attention inference and a 6.09x faster DiT training on 256x256 token sequences, while maintaining image generation quality.

Conclusion: LLSA is an efficient and scalable solution for training long-sequence Diffusion Transformers, significantly improving computational performance in high-resolution visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

*Kanwal Aftab,Graham Adams,Mark Scanlon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a three-stage deep learning pipeline to geolocate indoor settings using electric plug socket types, achieving high accuracy despite challenges like lighting variability and visual ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in indoor multimedia geolocation research, aiming to aid law enforcement in tackling crimes like human trafficking through innovative digital forensic tools.

Method: The pipeline uses deep learning to detect electric sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classify plug types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and map them to regions (accuracy = 0.96). It relies on a newly created, augmented dataset for training and testing under realistic conditions.

Result: The method achieved high detection and classification accuracy while being tested on realistic conditions, offering a practical way forward for forensic applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that electric plug sockets can serve as reliable geolocation markers in indoor environments, and the pipeline has high potential for use in digital forensic investigations.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

### [165] [DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16625)
*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeContext, a defense method to protect images from unauthorized editing by targeting cross-attention pathways during in-context editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the privacy risks posed by in-context diffusion models, which can easily manipulate personal images without consent.

Method: The method, called DeContext, uses targeted perturbations in multimodal attention layers to disrupt the propagation of contextual information from input to output.

Result: DeContext effectively blocks unauthorized edits while preserving visual quality, as demonstrated on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that attention-based perturbations are an efficient and robust way to defend against unauthorized image manipulation.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder, for improving SAR imagery analysis by addressing data scarcity and speckle noise issues through large-scale data, noise-aware techniques, and feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in SAR imagery analysis, such as scarce data and speckle noise, which limit fine-grained semantic representation learning.

Method: Proposes SARMAE, which includes (1) SAR-1M, a large SAR dataset with paired optical images for pre-training; (2) Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE) for tackling noise; and (3) Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) for aligning semantic features using optical priors.

Result: SARMAE surpasses state-of-the-art performance in tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation across multiple SAR datasets.

Conclusion: SARMAE effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges with noise-aware and semantically consistent representation learning, showcasing its potential for diverse SAR applications.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

### [167] [REGLUE Your Latents with Global and Local Semantics for Entangled Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16636)
*Giorgos Petsangourakis,Christos Sgouropoulos,Bill Psomas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Giorgos Sfikas,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes REGLUE, a new method improving latent diffusion models by utilizing comprehensive semantics from Vision Foundation Models to enhance image synthesis quality and address limitations in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models lack direct semantic supervision, slowing training and limiting output quality. There’s potential in enriching semantic integration by leveraging Vision Foundation Models comprehensively.

Method: REGLUE combines latent image representations with both local patch-level and global image-level semantics using a unified approach, involving a convolutional semantic compressor and alignment losses to incorporate multi-layered VFMs effectively.

Result: REGLUE enhances image synthesis on ImageNet, showing improvements in FID scores, accelerated convergence, and surpassing baseline models and competing strategies.

Conclusion: Spatial semantics and non-linear feature compression are critical for advancing diffusion models, with REGLUE demonstrating effective joint modeling of global-local-latent representations for better synthesis performance.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

### [168] [FrameDiffuser: G-Buffer-Conditioned Diffusion for Neural Forward Frame Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16670)
*Ole Beisswenger,Jan-Niklas Dihlmann,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameDiffuser is introduced to address challenges in interactive neural rendering by ensuring temporally consistent, photorealistic image generation using a G-buffer conditioned approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive neural rendering lacks methods that maintain temporal consistency and computational efficiency for real-time, user-dependent inputs.

Method: FrameDiffuser utilizes an autoregressive neural rendering approach with dual-conditioning architecture, combining ControlNet and ControlLoRA for structural and temporal coherence.

Result: FrameDiffuser achieves stable, photorealistic frame generation for extended sequences, surpassing generalized models in lighting, shadows, reflections, and inference speed within environment-specific training.

Conclusion: FrameDiffuser offers a practical solution for real-time, interactive neural rendering by improving temporal stability, efficiency, and visual quality through environment-specific, autoregressive techniques.

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates data leakage in open-source datasets and introduces subject fingerprinting for re-identification of subjects across datasets, achieving high performance using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source datasets may overlap, causing data leakage and artificially inflated model performance, creating a need for effective methods to identify subjects across datasets.

Method: The study implements subject fingerprinting using latent space mapping with a ResNet-50 model trained on triplet margin loss for similarity matching and evaluates its robustness in few-shot scenarios.

Result: The model shows strong re-identification performance with high Mean-Recall-@-K scores across both 3D MRI and 2D X-ray datasets in standard and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Subject fingerprinting proves effective for mitigating data leakage in open datasets, enabling robust subject identification in high-dimensional medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of deepfake detectors on detecting localized inpainting image manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the generalization ability of deepfake detection models on localized inpainting edits, given the growing cybersecurity threats posed by such manipulations.

Method: The research uses systematic evaluation on diverse datasets with varying image generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques.

Result: Detection models trained on a wide range of generators exhibit partial transferability to localized inpainting edits and perform effectively for medium-, large-area manipulations, or regeneration-style inpainting.

Conclusion: Deepfake detection models can partially adapt to inpainting manipulation detection, surpassing existing ad hoc approaches for significant image edits.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

*Antonella Rech,Nicola Conci,Nicola Garau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDFoam, a hybrid approach combining Voronoi Diagrams and Signed Distance Fields to improve mesh reconstruction in neural radiance field systems without compromising visual quality or training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF systems and their derivatives face challenges in precise mesh reconstruction despite their advancements in view synthesis and rendering techniques.

Method: The proposed method combines an explicit Voronoi Diagram with an implicit Signed Distance Field, optimized through ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective, to align Voronoi cell faces with metric-consistent surfaces.

Result: SDFoam achieves crisper, view-consistent surfaces with improved topology and fewer floaters, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining comparable training speed to RadiantFoam.

Conclusion: SDFoam effectively enhances mesh reconstruction accuracy while retaining efficiency and visual consistency, marking significant progress in NeRF-related rendering systems.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive, open dataset for fetal ultrasound biometry, including multi-centre, multi-device images with annotated landmarks, to promote the development of reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in fetal growth assessment caused by variability in manual measurements, operator dependency, and lack of diverse multi-source datasets—hindering reproducibility and accuracy of automated approaches.

Method: They created a multi-centre, multi-device dataset of 4,513 de-identified fetal ultrasound images from 1,904 subjects. The dataset includes expert annotations, standardised train/test splits, evaluation tools, and baseline models.

Result: The authors demonstrate domain shift challenges, showing that multi-centre training/testing prevents overestimation of performance observed in single-centre studies. They provide results as a benchmark for future work.

Conclusion: Their work sets a foundational benchmark for domain adaptation and generalisation in AI-assisted fetal biometry. By making all data and tools publicly accessible, they aim to improve fetal growth assessment across diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenges of limited public datasets and specialized algorithms for micro gesture recognition, where subtle motion patterns make skeleton data collection and detailed annotations difficult.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-view self-supervised pipeline for generating skeleton data, semi-automatic annotations, and uses hierarchical memory banks and learnable position-aware queries in the HMATr framework to detect and classify gestures effectively.

Result: They construct OMG-Bench with 40 gesture classes, 13,948 instances, and demonstrate that their HMATr model outperforms the previous state of the art by 7.6% in detection rate.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset, OMG-Bench, and the HMATr framework collectively establish a strong foundation and baseline for advancing online micro gesture recognition research.

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of controlling semantic masks and reducing sampling uncertainty in synthetic data generation, which limit its utility in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Method: The authors propose TODSynth, a task-oriented data synthesis framework using a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy based on task feedback.

Result: Experiments show that TODSynth outperforms existing controllable generation methods by providing more stable and task-specific synthetic data for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed TODSynth improves the effectiveness and stability of synthetic data for remote sensing tasks, bridging the gap between data generation and practical segmentation applications.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: Make-It-Poseable introduces a latent-space transformation framework for robust 3D character posing, overcoming limitations in traditional methods like poor pose conformance and topological imperfections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with inaccuracies in skinning weight prediction, topological issues, and poor pose conformance, limiting robustness and generalizability.

Method: The approach reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem, using a latent posing transformer for shape manipulation guided by skeletal motion and a dense pose representation.

Result: Make-It-Poseable achieves superior posing quality, allowing for high-fidelity geometry and adaptability to topological changes.

Conclusion: The framework improves 3D character posing and extends to applications like part replacement and refinement, enhancing robustness and generalizability in computer graphics tasks.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

*Enis Baty,C. P. Bridges,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet introduces a novel object detection framework utilizing Conditional Flow Matching, offering improved performance over diffusion-based systems with generalization to generative transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Build on DiffusionDet while addressing its inefficiencies; construct a more optimal pathway for object detection using generative techniques.

Method: Proposes Conditional Flow Matching for object detection, resulting in straighter transport paths and scalable performance during detection.

Result: FlowDet exceeds DiffusionDet's performance, achieving +3.6% AP on COCO and +4.2% AP_rare on LVIS, showcasing its effectiveness in precision and recall settings.

Conclusion: FlowDet generalizes generative transport models, providing faster and more accurate detection results compared to older diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create an integrated system that unifies video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning in a holistic framework, avoiding disjointed methods.

Method: Utilized an end-to-end structure, multimodal representation, large-scale pre-training strategies, and infrastructure optimizations.

Result: Showed robust performance in video generation, reasoning-driven editing, and multimodal instruction comprehension.

Conclusion: Kling-Omni is a significant step toward advanced multimodal simulators capable of generating dynamic, complex world interactions.

Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

*Simone Teglia,Claudia Melis Tonti,Francesco Pro,Leonardo Russo,Andrea Alfarano,Leonardo Pentassuglia,Irene Amerini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces R3ST, a synthetic dataset integrating real-world vehicle trajectories to improve trajectory forecasting in traffic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real datasets lack precise ground-truth annotations, while synthetic datasets fail to replicate realistic vehicle motion. This paper aims to combine the strengths of both types of datasets.

Method: The authors developed R3ST by creating a synthetic 3D environment that incorporates real-world vehicle trajectories from the SinD dataset, recorded via drone footage.

Result: R3ST achieves a blend of realistic vehicle motion and accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations for use in trajectory forecasting research.

Conclusion: R3ST bridges the gap between synthetic datasets and realistic traffic scenarios, enhancing road safety research and analysis.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

### [180] [KineST: A Kinematics-guided Spatiotemporal State Space Model for Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16791)
*Shuting Zhao,Zeyu Xiao,Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineST addresses the challenge of reconstructing full-body poses from sparse signals in AR/VR applications by introducing a kinematics-guided state space model that balances accuracy, temporal coherence, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accurate, smooth, and computationally efficient full-body motion tracking from sparse signals in AR/VR scenarios, which existing methods struggle to achieve.

Method: The paper proposes KineST, which uses a kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning strategy and a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach. It integrates local and global pose perception while introducing a geometric angular velocity loss for motion stability.

Result: KineST demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and temporal consistency compared to existing methods, within a lightweight computational framework.

Conclusion: KineST effectively balances accuracy, efficiency, and smooth motion tracking, making it suitable for AR/VR applications by addressing pose reconstruction challenges.

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

### [181] [DenseBEV: Transforming BEV Grid Cells into 3D Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16818)
*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DenseBEV, a method that uses BEV feature cells as anchors in multi-camera 3D object detection to improve detection efficiency and accuracy, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes and Waymo datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches in BEV-based transformers for multi-camera 3D object detection rely on random queries or auxiliary detections which lack efficiency and direct application.

Method: The paper proposes using BEV feature cells directly as object anchors with a two-stage anchor generation method, incorporating BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression and hybrid temporal modeling.

Result: DenseBEV achieves significant improvements in NDS and mAP metrics, notably enhancing small object detection with positive results on nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Conclusion: DenseBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets by leveraging dense BEV queries and introducing efficient modeling techniques, particularly excelling in small object detection.

Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures.

*Emmanuel D. Muñiz-De-León,Jorge A. Rosales-de-Golferichs,Ana S. Muñoz-Rodríguez,Alejandro I. Trejo-Castro,Eduardo de Avila-Armenta,Antonio Martínez-Torteya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a compact architecture using DINOv3 ViT encoder and GPT-2 decoder with anatomical attention to generate chest X-ray reports. It improves pathology classification and structural coherence significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a less resource-intensive and more accessible method for automatic radiology report generation, addressing limitations in current SOTA systems, which rely heavily on multimodal large-scale training and clinical metadata.

Method: The paper uses a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer encoder with a GPT-2 decoder enhanced by anatomical attention integration via lung and heart segmentation masks, enabling focused spatial attention without additional trainable parameters.

Result: The model achieves large performance improvements in pathology detection metrics, including increased Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 scores across key observations and enhanced structural coherence measured by RadGraph F1.

Conclusion: The model illustrates that anatomical-guided attention improves spatial grounding and report coherence, offering an accessible, image-only solution for chest X-ray findings generation.

Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

### [184] [GenEval 2: Addressing Benchmark Drift in Text-to-Image Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16853)
*Amita Kamath,Kai-Wei Chang,Ranjay Krishna,Luke Zettlemoyer,Yushi Hu,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the issues of benchmark drift in Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation, particularly in GenEval, and introduces a new benchmark, GenEval 2, along with a method called Soft-TIFA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of benchmark drift in evaluating the performance of T2I models and develop a more robust benchmarking framework that aligns with human judgment over time.

Method: The authors analyze GenEval's drift through human study and propose GenEval 2, a new benchmark with better primitive visual coverage and compositionality. Soft-TIFA is introduced as an evaluation method blending visual primitive judgments.

Result: GenEval 2 is shown to be more challenging for current T2I models, with Soft-TIFA aligning better with human judgments and being less prone to drift compared to holistic evaluations like VQAScore.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the importance of continuous auditing and improvement of T2I evaluation benchmarks and propose GenEval 2 as a more reliable alternative, though they acknowledge that avoiding benchmark drift entirely is an ongoing challenge.

Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RePlan introduces a framework for instruction-based image editing called Region-aligned Planning. It improves editing precision under complex instructions and visuals through step-by-step reasoning and multi-region edits without iterative processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in instruction-based image editing, particularly under scenarios with complex instructions and cluttered or ambiguous images, where existing models often fail.

Method: RePlan couples a vision-language planner using reasoning with a diffusion-based image editor. The planner breaks down instructions into explicit steps grounded in image regions, and the editor applies precise, parallel edits using attention-region injection. Reinforcement learning was employed to enhance reasoning and reliability.

Result: RePlan achieves better performance in complex image editing scenarios, showing improved precision and fidelity in regional edits. It outperforms models trained on larger datasets and introduces a new benchmark, IV-Edit, for evaluating instruction-visual complexity.

Conclusion: The RePlan framework proves effective in managing IV-Complex scenarios, advancing natural-language driven image editing by enhancing reasoning, precision, and reliability.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel Seal introduces advancements in image and video watermarking, achieving state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility by addressing key issues in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods struggle with robustness, imperceptibility, optimization instability, and scalability to high-resolution digital content.

Method: Pixel Seal employs adversarial-only training, a three-stage decoupled training strategy, and high-resolution adaptation using JND-based attenuation and inference simulation.

Result: Pixel Seal outperforms existing watermarking methods on both robustness and imperceptibility metrics across images and videos, showing scalability to real-world resolutions and transformations.

Conclusion: Pixel Seal represents a scalable and reliable approach for digital content provenance, improving robustness and imperceptibility compared to current techniques.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

TL;DR: ReMeDI-SAM3 is a training-free memory-enhanced framework for surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos, achieving improved performance over SAM3 by addressing occlusion and memory limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of surgical instruments in endoscopic videos is critical for computer-assisted interventions but faces challenges such as occlusions, motion, and artefacts.

Method: Proposes ReMeDI-SAM3, a memory-enhanced version of SAM3, with occlusion-aware memory, expanded memory capacity through interpolation, and a re-identification module to recover identities after occlusions.

Result: ReMeDI-SAM3 achieves 7% and 16% mcIoU improvements on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 datasets, respectively, under zero-shot settings, surpassing even training-based methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively alleviates error accumulation and improves post-occlusion recovery, demonstrating significant advancements in video object segmentation for surgical applications.

Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

*Norika Wada,Kohei Yamashita,Ryo Kawahara,Ko Nishino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-PhyGs, a method to estimate the multi-material properties of complex natural objects like flowers from videos, overcoming assumptions of homogeneity in prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of estimating physical material properties of real-world objects, which are often complex in material composition and geometry, unlike the assumptions in existing methods of homogeneity or pre-learned dynamics.

Method: The method, M-PhyGs, jointly segments an object into similar materials and estimates their mechanical parameters using cascaded 3D and 2D losses and temporal mini-batching, based on video data. Gravity is also accounted for in the estimations.

Result: The proposed M-PhyGs method demonstrates accurate and effective material parameter estimation, as shown by experiments conducted on the newly introduced Phlowers dataset.

Conclusion: M-PhyGs provides a novel and efficient approach for estimating physical parameters in complex, multi-material objects from videos, with validated performance on a new dataset featuring interactions with flowers.

Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

*Haichao Zhang,Yao Lu,Lichen Wang,Yunzhe Li,Daiwei Chen,Yunpeng Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LinkedOut, a novel approach for video recommendation using Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) while overcoming challenges like latency, multi-video input support, and loss of visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations of VLLMs for downstream tasks like video recommendation, such as high latency, lack of support for multi-video input, and loss of fine-grained visual details when outputs are constrained to language.

Method: LinkedOut is introduced as a representation extracting VLLM world knowledge from raw video frames using promptable queries and auxiliary modalities. It includes a cross-layer knowledge fusion mechanism to select abstraction levels from VLLM features.

Result: LinkedOut achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks for video recommendation, offering interpretability and low-latency inference while handling raw frame inputs without handcrafted labels.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the feasibility of using VLLM world knowledge and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks, providing a practical and interpretable path forward.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

Result: The proposed method achieves 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control and comparable animation quality to state-of-the-art methods, surpassing alternatives in speed-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: This method provides an expressive, fast, and 3D-consistent approach to facial animation, suitable for real-world applications like digital twins or telepresence.

Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

*Shuyuan Tu,Yueming Pan,Yinming Huang,Xintong Han,Zhen Xing,Qi Dai,Kai Qiu,Chong Luo,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashPortrait introduces an end-to-end video diffusion transformer for long-portrait animations, delivering ID-preserving videos with up to 6x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in ensuring identity consistency in long-portrait animations with current diffusion-based methods, while also improving synthesis efficiency.

Method: FlashPortrait extracts identity-agnostic facial features, aligns them with diffusion latents using a Normalized Facial Expression Block, and employs dynamic sliding-windows with weighted blending for smooth transitions. It predicts future latents using higher-order latent derivatives, skipping denoising steps for acceleration.

Result: FlashPortrait achieves identity-preserved animations with smooth transitions and accelerates inference by up to 6x, validated through qualitative and quantitative benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach improves ID consistency and efficiency in long-portrait animations, setting a new standard for diffusion-based animation methods.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [192] [Alchemist: Unlocking Efficiency in Text-to-Image Model Training via Meta-Gradient Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16905)
*Kaixin Ding,Yang Zhou,Xi Chen,Miao Yang,Jiarong Ou,Rui Chen,Xin Tao,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Alchemist, a meta-gradient-based framework for selecting high-quality subsets of text-to-image datasets, improving T2I model training efficiency and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancements in text-to-image generation models are hindered by low-quality or redundant training data, which degrades visual fidelity and efficiency, necessitating better data selection methods.

Method: Alchemist employs a two-stage framework: 1) Data rating through a lightweight rater to estimate sample quality using gradient-based multi-granularity perception, and 2) Data pruning using a Shift-Gsampling strategy to choose effective subsets.

Result: Alchemist boosts T2I model performance by enabling training on subsets (50%) without compromising quality, effectively outperforming training on full datasets.

Conclusion: Alchemist is a pioneering, scalable framework for text-to-image data selection using automatic meta-gradients, proving valuable in both synthetic and real-world dataset scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

*Xiaoyan Cong,Haotian Yang,Angtian Wang,Yizhi Wang,Yiding Yang,Canyu Zhang,Chongyang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIVA is a novel framework for instruction-based video editing that uses a VLM-guided encoding system and reward optimization to improve generalization and editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for instruction-based video editing struggle to handle diverse and complex real-world instructions due to limitations in paired data training.

Method: VIVA uses a VLM-based instructor for visually-grounded instruction representations and employs Edit-GRPO, a reward optimization approach, to enhance video editing performance.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal VIVA's superiority in both instruction following and video editing quality compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VIVA provides a scalable and effective solution for diverse real-world video editing instructions, advancing the capabilities of diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

TL;DR: This paper addresses multiview object change detection using a novel benchmark (SceneDiff Benchmark) and a training-free method (SceneDiff) that achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of detecting object changes (additions, removals, or movements) in a scene across different captures, essential for applications such as robotic operations and construction monitoring, while addressing challenges posed by viewpoint variations.

Method: The authors introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, a multiview change detection dataset, and propose the SceneDiff method, which aligns captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and uses pretrained models to compare spatial and semantic features for detecting changes.

Result: Their method outperforms existing techniques with substantial accuracy improvements: 94% and 37.4% relative AP increases on multi-view and two-view benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: SceneDiff Benchmark and method provide a robust framework for multiview object change detection, setting a new standard for this task with high accuracy. The resources will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements). The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

*Qihang Rao,Borui Zhang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'SFTok,' a discrete visual tokenizer that achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction with improved results at high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete tokenizers often underperform compared to continuous ones in multimodal systems due to training-inference inconsistencies and challenges in precise image reconstruction.

Method: The authors introduce SFTok, a discrete tokenizer that employs a multi-step iterative reconstruction process, self-forcing guided visual reconstruction, and a debias-and-fitting training strategy.

Result: SFTok achieves top-tier image reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) at a high compression rate and exceptional performance in class-to-image generation (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: SFTok effectively addresses the limitations of discrete tokenizers, making them a viable and high-performing option for multimodal tasks in high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a panoramic depth foundation model with superior generalization across diverse scenes, supported by a novel data collection and curation paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate depth estimation that seamlessly adapts across diverse indoor/outdoor real-world scenes motivated this research.

Method: A panoramic depth prediction model leveraging DINOv3-Large backbone with novel range mask head and optimization strategies. It employs a pseudo-labeling pipeline to curate synthetic and real image data.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance and robust zero-shot generalization on multiple benchmarks for metric depth predictions.

Conclusion: This panoramic depth foundation model achieves reliable and robust predictions, advancing generalization capabilities in real-world contexts.

Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

TL;DR: The paper presents StereoPilot, a model for efficient Monocular-to-Stereo video conversion, overcoming issues in depth-based approaches and demonstrating superior visual fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of producing 3D video content and the limitations of traditional Monocular-to-Stereo conversion methods, which suffer from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and stereo configuration inconsistencies.

Method: The method involves introducing UniStereo, a unified dataset for stereo video conversion, and proposing StereoPilot, a feed-forward model equipped with a learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss to directly synthesize stereo views without explicit depth mapping.

Result: StereoPilot's performance surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher visual fidelity and computational efficiency in stereo video conversion.

Conclusion: StereoPilot, supported by the UniStereo dataset, provides a breakthrough solution for automated, high-quality Monocular-to-Stereo video conversion, overcoming traditional pipeline limitations and adapting to different stereo formats.

Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AdaTooler-V, a multimodal large language model, improves visual reasoning by adaptively using tools only when necessary. It outperforms existing methods and achieves notable benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often show unnecessary tool usage in visual reasoning tasks, leading to higher computational overhead and reduced performance. This paper aims to address this problem.

Method: The paper introduces AdaTooler-V, which uses AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to adaptively determine the necessity of tool usage based on a Tool Benefit Score. Additionally, two datasets, AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k and AdaTooler-V-300k, were constructed for training.

Result: AdaTooler-V was evaluated across twelve benchmarks and demonstrated superior visual reasoning capabilities. It achieved remarkable performance, such as 89.8% accuracy on the high-resolution V* benchmark, outperforming commercial proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Conclusion: AdaTooler-V addresses the challenge of blind tool use in multimodal models by adaptively invoking vision tools only when required. Its effectiveness and improved performance make it a notable advancement in visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video editing is less explored compared to image editing, requiring advancements in consistency, control, and generalization mechanisms.

Method: The framework builds diverse video pairs using existing techniques, employs efficient architecture with light LoRA fine-tuning, and offers spatiotemporal control using a mask mechanism. It uses flexible inputs such as video+text, video+mask+text, and others.

Result: EasyV2V achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

Conclusion: EasyV2V demonstrates effective, simple instruction-based video editing, providing diverse input flexibility and superior performance compared to existing frameworks.

Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

*Qihao Liu,Chengzhi Mao,Yaojie Liu,Alan Yuille,Wen-Sheng Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AuditDM, a framework to audit and improve multimodal LLMs using interpretable error analysis with generated counterexamples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs fail to adequately identify capability gaps and provide interpretable insights.

Method: AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM via reinforcement learning to create adversarial questions and images, enabling discovery of model weaknesses for improvement.

Result: AuditDM identifies over 20 failure types in state-of-the-art models like Gemma-3, enhancing their performance across 16 benchmarks after rectifications.

Conclusion: Targeted auditing, rather than sheer data scaling, is an effective approach for diagnosing and improving large multimodal language models.

Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA) as a new self-supervised learning paradigm for visual tasks, using a Transformer trained to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were inspired by the success of generative pretraining in NLP and sought to explore if similar principles could lead to strong self-supervised methods for vision tasks.

Method: The method involves training a Transformer with next embedding prediction as its sole objective. Using causal masking and stop-gradient techniques, the model predicts future patch embeddings without relying on pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, or contrastive learning.

Result: The proposed NEPA method achieves 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K when fine-tuned with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones, respectively. It also demonstrates effective transfer learning performance on semantic segmentation tasks (ADE20K).

Conclusion: The study concludes that generative pretraining using embeddings offers a simple, scalable, and potentially generalizable approach to self-supervised visual learning.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Generative Refocusing technique for single-image refocusing that combines sharp image recovery and realistic bokeh generation with semi-supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in single-image refocusing, which include difficulty in recovering sharp content and realistic bokeh without all-in-focus input and reliance on synthetic data.

Method: The method employs a two-step process: DeblurNet recovers sharp images, and BokehNet generates controllable bokeh, using semi-supervised training with a mix of synthetic and unpaired real data.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks, surpassing existing approaches.

Conclusion: Generative Refocusing offers a novel and effective solution for single-image refocusing with added flexibility, including text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

Conclusion: WorldCanvas enhances world modeling by shifting from passive predictors to interactive simulators, providing users with a powerful tool to generate complex and controllable simulations and events.

Abstract: We present WorldCanvas, a framework for promptable world events that enables rich, user-directed simulation by combining text, trajectories, and reference images. Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

### [204] [LOG.io: Unified Rollback Recovery and Data Lineage Capture for Distributed Data Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16038)
*Eric Simon,Renato B. Hoffmann,Lucas Alf,Dalvan Griebler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LOG.io is a solution for rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage in distributed serverless architectures. It performs competitively during normal processing and excels during recovery under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed data pipelines lack efficient mechanisms for rollback recovery and detailed data lineage tracking in serverless settings.

Method: LOG.io employs a log-based rollback recovery protocol designed for scalability and adaptability. It supports non-deterministic operations, external integrations, and dynamic scaling, and allows independent operator recovery.

Result: Experiments show LOG.io is competitive with ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery in specific scenarios. Data lineage capture adds less than 1.5% overhead.

Conclusion: LOG.io is effective for distributed data pipeline management, particularly excelling in recovery scenarios, and introduces minimal overhead for data lineage capture.

Abstract: This paper introduces LOG.io, a comprehensive solution designed for correct rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage capture in distributed data pipelines. It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses PCIe bandwidth limitations causing performance bottlenecks in large language models (LLMs), proposing Multipath Memory Access (MMA) to enable efficient GPU-host memory transfers and achieve significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the critical bottlenecks caused by limited PCIe bandwidth during operations like prefix cache fetching and model switching in LLMs.

Method: The authors introduced MMA, a scheme that ensures efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory using dynamic library injection, requiring no modification in existing code.

Result: MMA achieves a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s (4.62x improvement) and significantly reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) and model-switching latency by up to 2.48x.

Conclusion: MMA improves intra-server bandwidth utilization and reduces latency in LLM applications, making GPU-host memory interactions more efficient.

Abstract: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

*Yifei Qiu,Tianle Liao,Xin Jin,Shaohua Wu,Dusit Niyato,Qinyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Goal-Oriented Semantic Twin (GOST), a new paradigm for digital twinning within the 6G-integrated networks, focusing on utility over physical fidelity to overcome limitations of traditional digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from the need for real-time situational awareness in SAGSIN while traditional digital twins face constraints such as high computational overhead and delayed synchronization.

Method: The proposed GOST framework employs lightweight, task-specific representations centered on semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles, organized into three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles.

Result: The GOST framework demonstrates superior timeliness in perceptual data and collaborative tracking tasks in a case study involving remote satellite-UAV networks, outperforming conventional digital twins.

Conclusion: GOST revolutionizes the approach to digital twinning for SAGSIN, prioritizing task-specific utility, and offers transformative potential for future 6G systems development.

Abstract: A space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) has emerged as a cornerstone of 6G systems, establishing a unified global architecture by integrating multi-domain network resources. Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking. Finally, we outline research directions, establishing GOST as a transformative twinning paradigm to guide the development of SAGSIN.

*Syed Salauddin Mohammad Tariq,Foyzul Hassan,Amiangshu Bosu,Probir Roy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses cold-start latency in serverless systems as a design issue rather than a black-box optimization. It introduces SCABENCH and INITSCOPE for systematic diagnostics and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start latency hinders serverless system performance, and the goal is to address it as a developer-visible problem by identifying and resolving design and diagnostic challenges.

Method: The study analyzed issue reports from open-source serverless systems to derive patterns and strategies. SCABENCH benchmark and INITSCOPE framework were developed to improve diagnostics and localization.

Result: Using SCABENCH and INITSCOPE, localization accuracy was enhanced by 40%, diagnostic effort decreased by 64%, and developers benefited from higher task accuracy and faster resolution.

Conclusion: The work promotes performance-aware practices for mitigating cold-start latency in serverless systems design effectively. Research outputs are publicly accessible for advancement.

Abstract: Serverless computing simplifies deployment and scaling, yet cold-start latency remains a major performance bottleneck. Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design. Availability: The research artifact is publicly accessible for future studies and improvements.

### [208] [An Online Fragmentation-Aware Scheduler for Managing GPU-Sharing Workloads on Multi-Instance GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16099)
*Hsu-Tzu Ting,Jerry Chou,Ming-Hung Chen,I-Hsin Chung*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in efficiently sharing GPU resources using NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology and proposes an online scheduling framework to improve system efficiency, achieving a 35% improvement in makespan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPU workloads often underutilize GPU resources, necessitating efficient resource-sharing mechanisms that also tackle issues like resource contention and GPU fragmentation arising from NVIDIA's MIG technology.

Method: The authors designed an online scheduling framework combining conditional load balancing, dynamic GPU partitioning, and job migration to address resource contention and fragmentation.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improved system efficiency, reducing the makespan by up to 35%.

Conclusion: By dynamically adapting job placement, the approach mitigates contention and fragmentation challenges in MIG systems, leading to a more efficient use of GPU resources.

Abstract: Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS) to address scheduling inefficiencies in distributed LLM architecture, significantly improving Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve scheduling inefficiencies in distributed LLM architectures, particularly addressing high internal synchronization costs and performance degradation in DP+EP setups.

Method: The proposed method, SBS, buffers requests to create execution batches and eliminates internal queuing bubbles. Additionally, Load-Aware Global Allocation balances computational load across DP units.

Result: SBS implementation reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and throughput improves by 15%-20% when deployed on a production H800 cluster.

Conclusion: Staggered Batch Scheduling effectively addresses scheduling challenges in large-scale distributed LLMs, offering significant performance gains without sacrificing throughput.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) serving towards complex, distributed architectures--specifically the P/D-separated, large-scale DP+EP paradigm--introduces distinct scheduling challenges. Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.

*Zhisheng Hu,Pengfei Zuo,Junliang Hu,Yizou Chen,Yingjia Wang,Ming-Chang Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lotus, a distributed transaction system for disaggregated memory that separates locks from data and implements them on compute nodes to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed transaction systems for disaggregated memory experience performance bottlenecks due to high volumes of one-sided atomic operations for locks, limiting scalability.

Method: Lotus disaggregates locks from data, shifting lock management from memory nodes to compute nodes. It employs an OLTP-aware lock management approach, a lock-first transaction protocol, and an efficient lock-recovery mechanism.

Result: Experimental evaluations show Lotus achieves up to 2.1× higher transaction throughput and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: Lotus successfully addresses the limitations of existing DM transaction systems by improving scalability, throughput, and latency through innovative lock disaggregation and management techniques.

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.
  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexKV is a memory-disaggregated key-value store system addressing performance limitations by introducing index proxying and other optimizations, achieving significant improvements in throughput and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaggregated memory architectures have potential advantages, but existing key-value stores suffer from performance bottlenecks related to index operations and compute-side caching.

Method: The paper proposes FlexKV, which dynamically offloads index processing to compute nodes, incorporates rank-aware load balancing, memory optimization schemes, and an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism.

Result: FlexKV achieves up to 2.94× higher throughput and reduces latency by up to 85.2% compared to other memory-disaggregated KV stores.

Conclusion: FlexKV effectively resolves performance bottlenecks for memory-disaggregated KV stores by leveraging index proxying and efficient resource management techniques.

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs), particularly Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, on consumer-grade hardware due to their high memory and computational requirements.

Method: A novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework with GPU-based expert caching to reduce data transfers and CPU offloading for efficient cache miss handling with multithreading.

Result: The framework achieves performance improvement in inference speed and hardware utilization for single-request scenarios on consumer-grade systems.

Conclusion: CPU-GPU collaboration can significantly enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE models on consumer-level hardware, optimizing performance and addressing memory constraints. The implementation is open-sourced for broader application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes M-ESU, a method for upgrading multi-access edge computing systems over multiple stages while optimizing task satisfaction under given constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of upgrading MEC systems over time to meet growing task demands and stricter performance requirements.

Method: The paper introduces two methods: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for small networks and a heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H) for handling larger networks effectively.

Result: The M-ESU/H heuristic performs within 1.25% of the optimal solution in small networks and outperforms other heuristics by up to 21.57% in large networks under identical conditions.

Conclusion: M-ESU/H is a scalable and practical solution for long-term planning in MEC systems, balancing cost and operational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.

TL;DR: AIE4ML is a framework converting AI models into firmware optimized for AMD's newer AIE-ML architectures, achieving high efficiency and GPU-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is difficult due to resource and design constraints that hinder full-fledged neural network execution.

Method: AIE4ML provides automatic conversion of AI models into firmware, emphasizing single-kernel performance, scalable parallelization, and compact graph placement tailored to AIE-ML architecture.

Result: The framework achieves 98.6% efficiency relative to single-kernel performance, utilizes 97.4% of AIE tiles, and delivers high throughput with microsecond latency for real-world models.

Conclusion: AIE4ML is effective for AI inference on AIE-ML architecture, delivering GPU-class efficiency for high-speed, low-latency applications.

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

Motivation: Traditional methods rely on fixed-parameter convex expressions and often face difficulties in post-hoc convexity verification, posing challenges for generating accurate and flexible models for control and optimization.

Method: A data-driven framework, DiscoverDCP, integrates symbolic regression with DCP rules to ensure all discovered model expressions are globally convex by enforcing DCP composition rules.

Result: The framework enables the discovery of convex surrogate models with more flexible and accurate functional forms, surpassing traditional convex expressions.

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP provides interpretable, globally convex, and verification-friendly models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance financial market prediction accuracy amidst challenges of noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency.

Method: A hybrid ensemble combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, diverse models, and strategic filtering of predictors.

Result: Achieved 60.14% directional accuracy on S&P 500 predictions, with statistical significance ($p<0.05$) and improved Sharpe ratio in backtesting.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates improved prediction accuracy, surpassing traditional approaches, and showcases practical trading potential through backtesting metrics.

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

TL;DR: KANs face memory challenges due to high parameter demands; SHARe-KAN employs efficient compression and hardware optimization to decrease memory usage drastically while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs exhibit a holographic topology, leading to inefficiency in memory-constrained environments due to the failure of traditional methods like pruning.

Method: Proposes SHARe-KAN, combining Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization and LUTHAM compiler for efficient memory use and hardware compatibility.

Result: Achieves $88\times$ memory usage reduction and maintains model performance, with $>$90% L2 cache efficiency in NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

Conclusion: SHARe-KAN enables practical deployment of KANs by resolving memory bottlenecks without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

*Feng Liu,Hao Cang,Huanhuan Yuan,Jiaqing Fan,Yongjing Hao,Fuzhen Zhuang,Guanfeng Liu,Pengpeng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation tasks, proving their equivalence and introducing tools to enhance recommendation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the unclear role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in influencing recommendation tasks and improving the capability of GNNs.

Method: The paper introduces a frequency signal scaler to adjust graph signal smoothing and a space flip method to enhance graph embedding expressiveness.

Result: The findings prove the equivalence of low- and high-frequency signals in recommendations, and demonstrate that either signal type suffices for performance. Extensive experiments on four datasets validate the methods.

Conclusion: Low- and high-frequency graph signals behave equivalently for recommendations, and the newly proposed methods enhance GNN-based recommendation effectiveness.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLaDA2.0, a novel approach to creating discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) by systematically converting pre-trained auto-regressive models without training them from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to establish a more efficient and practical method to achieve frontier-scale language models by reusing pre-trained auto-regressive (AR) models, avoiding high costs and complexities of training a model from scratch.

Method: It introduces a 3-phase block-level training scheme: increasing block-size diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable), and compact-size block diffusion (decay). After this, the models undergo post-training alignment using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Distributional Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: The result includes two scalable, instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models—LLaDA2.0-mini (16B parameters) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B parameters)—optimized for practical deployment, with improved efficiency and parallel decoding capabilities.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 demonstrates a novel and practical pathway for scaling large language models while preserving performance and efficiency. By open-sourcing the models, the paper contributes to the broader AI community and its deployment challenges.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

### [222] [A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15746)
*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Janus,' a unified generative-predictive framework for the inverse design of heterogeneous materials, achieving efficient and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inverse design of material microstructures is computationally challenging due to high-dimensional design spaces, multimodal input properties, and nonlinear physics. Existing methods struggle to provide fast and physics-informed deterministic solutions.

Method: The paper presents Janus, a framework combining a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive separable KHRONOS head. Janus optimizes a latent manifold that allows generative inversion linked with physical prediction, achieving disentangled latent representations.

Result: Janus achieves impressive results: MNIST dataset validation shows accurate classification and generation; for microstructures, $R^2=0.98$ prediction accuracy, <5% reconstruction error, and <1% inverse design property error. Smooth property traversal and low-dimensional latent emergences were confirmed.

Conclusion: Janus unifies prediction and generation within a single latent space, enabling real-time and physics-informed inverse design with reduced computational costs compared to traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

### [223] [Explicit and Non-asymptotic Query Complexities of Rank-Based Zeroth-order Algorithms on Smooth Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16200)
*Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes rank-based zeroth-order optimization and provides explicit, non-asymptotic query complexities for certain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current theoretical understanding of rank-based zeroth-order optimization methods is limited and lacks explicit convergence rates.

Method: The paper analyzes a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishes non-asymptotic query complexities for $μ$-strongly convex and smooth non-convex problems.

Result: For $d$-dimensional problems with $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex functions, a suboptimal solution is found with complexity $	ilde{O}(\frac{dL}{μ}\log\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. For smooth non-convex functions, complexity is $O(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. These hold with high probability.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into why rank-based heuristics are efficient, avoiding traditional techniques, and establishing new non-asymptotic guarantees for ZO optimization.

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

*Mélissa Tamine,Otmane Sakhi,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the computational challenges of data valuation for training large language models and simplifies these challenges using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient data valuation is essential to determine the best strategies for curating data and to enable collaborations between data owners for LLM training, overcoming resource constraints.

Method: The paper leverages cooperative game theory, specifically the Shapley value, and introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a computationally efficient method for data valuation in LLM training.

Result: Demonstrated that Shapley values, traditionally computationally expensive for data valuation, can be efficiently computed using DPO when applied to training large language models.

Conclusion: Direct Preference Optimization unlocks scalable data valuation, enhancing the collaboration and data selection processes for training superior LLMs and enabling various applications in this intersection.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

### [225] [D3G: Diverse Demographic Data Generation Increases Zero-Shot Image Classification Accuracy within Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15747)
*Javon Hickmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses demographic bias in zero-shot image classification and proposes a novel method, Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), for improving accuracy in multimodal models using diverse inference-time data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification remains difficult due to challenges such as underfitting in low-capacity models and demographic bias stemming from unbalanced datasets, which can lead to harmful biases.

Method: The authors propose D3G, a zero-shot, training-free method that enhances multimodal models by employing diverse demographic data during inference. CLIP is utilized for semantic understanding, while Stable Diffusion XL generates rich cross-modal data.

Result: Integrating diverse demographic data at inference time improves classification accuracy and reduces harmful bias in pre-trained multimodal models like CLIP.

Conclusion: Diverse demographic data generation is an effective and computationally practical approach for reducing bias and boosting the accuracy of multimodal models in zero-shot image classification tasks.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

*Roman Akramov,Artem Khamatullin,Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares four methods for choosing the number of topics in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), showing that learned amortized methods outperform evolutionary strategies in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the selection of the number of topics in LDA, which critically impacts the performance and interpretability of topic models, using efficient and accurate methods.

Method: The authors treat topic selection as a discrete black-box optimization problem, comparing two hand-designed evolutionary algorithms (GA, ES) against two learned amortized approaches (PABBO, SABBO) under a fixed evaluation budget.

Result: SABBO and PABBO outperform GA and ES in sample- and time-efficiency while reaching similar perplexity levels, with SABBO achieving near-optimal results after only one evaluation.

Conclusion: Learned amortized optimization methods (e.g., SABBO, PABBO) are more effective than traditional evolutionary strategies for optimal topic selection in LDA, achieving similar or better results with less computational cost.

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

*Xinjie He,Chenggong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) method to enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions efficiently in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are promising for solving PDEs in complex systems, but they face challenges with accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. This study aims to improve PINNs' performance, particularly with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Method: The study integrates the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework with numerical time-stepping schemes, such as Euler and Heun methods, and incorporates boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function to handle Dirichlet constraints.

Result: Experimental results on the heat equation show that the Heun method achieves higher accuracy due to second-order corrections, while the Euler method is more computationally efficient for simpler problems.

Conclusion: This work showcases a novel framework for improving PINNs in handling Dirichlet boundary conditions, with potential for extension to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader PDE applications.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

### [228] [Surely Large Multimodal Models (Don't) Excel in Visual Species Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15748)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of Visual Species Recognition (VSR) under limited labeled data conditions, demonstrating that Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) underperform in this task but can effectively correct predictions made by expert models. It introduces Post-hoc Correction (POC), improving VSR accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the difficulty of building accurate Visual Species Recognition (VSR) models when domain expertise limits the quantity of labeled data, driving the need for effective few-shot learning approaches.

Method: The study compares Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) against few-shot learning (FSL) expert models and introduces a Post-hoc Correction (POC) method. POC uses enriched prompts (including softmax confidence and few-shot examples) for LMMs to refine the predictions of FSL models.

Result: POC achieves superior performance across five VSR benchmarks, improving accuracy by +6.4% over previous FSL methods, with no additional training or manual intervention required.

Conclusion: POC effectively enhances VSR accuracy and generalizes well across pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a scalable plug-and-play enhancement for existing methods.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

### [229] [A Special Case of Quadratic Extrapolation Under the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15749)
*Abiel Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores quadratic extrapolation of ReLU MLP under NTK near the origin, contrasting with prior work emphasizing linearity for out-of-distribution points far from the origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the special case of extrapolation of ReLU MLP close to the origin under the NTK regime, as it has been underexplored compared to far-from-origin out-of-distribution evaluations.

Method: The paper identifies the translational and rotational invariance properties of the induced NTK feature map and contrasts extrapolation near versus far from the origin.

Result: The research uncovers that quadratic extrapolation occurs for evaluations close to the origin, differing from linear extrapolation for evaluations far away from the origin.

Conclusion: Close-to-origin extrapolation under NTK for ReLU MLP does not adhere strictly to linearity, revealing critical differences from far-from-origin behavior.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

*Wei Guan,Jian Cao,Jinyu Cai,Qiqi Cai,Jianqi Gao,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLOW, a framework that combines GNNs and LLMs to improve AW performance prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability of automating Agentic Workflows is hindered by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation and the inability of current methods to capture complex dependencies and semantic logic.

Method: GLOW integrates graph-oriented large language models (LLMs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) and utilizes a contrastive alignment strategy for refined performance prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on the FLORA-Bench dataset demonstrate that GLOW achieves superior prediction accuracy and ranking utility compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GLOW presents a powerful unified framework that enhances AW performance prediction by leveraging graph-structure modeling and semantic reasoning, making it a promising advancement in the field.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

### [231] [TAO-Net: Two-stage Adaptive OOD Classification Network for Fine-grained Encrypted Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15753)
*Zihao Wang,Wei Peng,Junming Zhang,Jian Li,Wenxin Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) to enhance encrypted traffic classification, particularly for emerging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to classify new or unknown traffic types effectively. Existing solutions lack fine-grained classification for OOD traffic.

Method: TAO-Net employs a two-stage approach: 1) a hybrid OOD detection mechanism using transformer-based smoothness and feature analysis to classify ID and OOD traffic; 2) large language models and semantic-enhanced prompts to convert OOD classification into a generation task, allowing detailed classification without predefined labels.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of TAO-Net, with macro-precision ranging from 96.81-97.70% and macro-F1 from 96.77-97.68%, outperforming existing approaches which achieve only 44.73-86.30%.

Conclusion: TAO-Net offers a highly effective method for both ID and fine-grained OOD traffic classification, enabling improved handling of emerging network applications.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

### [232] [Provably Extracting the Features from a General Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15987)
*Allen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops an efficient query algorithm to recover feature directions and functions from noisy oracle access in superpositions, overcoming challenges in the overcomplete regime using a new Fourier space search approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the encoding of features in superposition by machine learning models can improve interpretability and function reconstruction, especially in the challenging overcomplete regime where the number of features exceeds the dimension.

Method: The paper proposes a novel algorithm that iteratively refines the search in Fourier space to locate feature directions, ensuring it works with arbitrary superpositions and general response functions under mild constraints.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies feature directions and reconstructs the function in noisy oracle settings, generalizing previous results to handle arbitrary features and responses.

Conclusion: The study broadens application contexts for feature recovery in superpositions, providing an effective tool for understanding machine learning processes and enabling function reconstruction in challenging settings.

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$.

*Luis A. De la Fuente,Hernan A. Moreno,Laura V. Alvarez,Hoshin V. Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents two new tools, PKAN and MKAN, for interpreting complex datasets using a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), offering better insights compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting complex datasets with high dimensionality and variable collinearity, and to improve upon traditional correlation analyses.

Method: Introducing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with PKAN and MKAN matrices for analyzing nonlinear associations and feature contributions in models.

Result: Experiments show that PKAN and MKAN offer more robust and informative insights than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information.

Conclusion: PKAN and MKAN enhance interpretability by capturing hidden relationships and promoting the development of domain-informed models.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

### [234] [CauSTream: Causal Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Streamflow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16046)
*Shu Wan,Reepal Shah,John Sabo,Huan Liu,K. Selçuk Candan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CauStream is a framework designed for streamflow forecasting that integrates causal graphs and routing graphs to enhance performance, interpretability, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for streamflow forecasting overlook physical processes, reducing their interpretability and adaptability. Addressing this, causal learning approaches integrate domain knowledge but rely on rigid causal graphs that do not adapt to new data.

Method: CauStream simultaneously learns a runoff causal graph for meteorological forcings and a routing graph for dynamic dependencies across stations, establishing identifiability conditions under a nonparametric setting.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across forecasting horizons in major U.S. river basins, with its performance improving particularly for longer forecast windows. Additionally, it infers interpretable causal graphs that align with domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CauStream improves streamflow forecasting by offering interpretable, adaptive modeling of causal and dynamic relationships. Its foundation extends potential applications to broader scientific and environmental domains.

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

*Yoonpyo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReactorFold presents a generative framework utilizing language modeling to innovate nuclear reactor core design by transcending fixed human-defined configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nuclear reactor core design methods are limited by pre-defined configuration spaces, preventing the discovery of novel design topologies.

Method: The ReactorFold framework models fuel-assembly design as a sequence problem for language models, using Monte Carlo simulations, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: ReactorFold expands design space by autonomously adjusting gadolinium rod inventory and discovering asymmetric configurations, surpassing traditional heuristics and design methods.

Conclusion: Language models like ReactorFold can understand physical relationships to uncover innovative design configurations beyond human-imposed constraints.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

*Takuya Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a tree-based nonparametric regression model for multivariate predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model for multivariate targets that quantifies predictive uncertainty in a nonparametric, efficient, and trustworthy manner for real-world AI scenarios.

Method: TQF estimates conditional quantiles of projections, aggregates them across directions, and reconstructs multivariate distributions using sliced Wasserstein distance in an efficient manner.

Result: TQF effectively models uncertainty without convexity restrictions or separate models for directions, proving its efficacy on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: TQF represents an advance in multivariate uncertainty modeling, offering scalable and reliable predictions without conventional limitations.

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM) that enhances computational efficiency and generalization in multi-view learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the challenges of capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using kernel tricks and to enhance robustness against view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets.

Method: The authors propose TMvRKM, which integrates kernel machines with multi-view frameworks. It employs a regularized least squares approach instead of solving large QPPs, includes a coupling term to balance errors across views, and incorporates both early and late fusion strategies.

Result: TMvRKM showed exceptional generalization performance across UCI, KEEL, and AwA datasets, consistently outperforming baseline models based on experimental and statistical analyses.

Conclusion: TMvRKM provides an effective and computationally efficient method for multi-view learning, solving key challenges and improving classification performance across various datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

### [239] [Kascade: A Practical Sparse Attention Method for Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16391)
*Dhruv Deshmukh,Saurabh Goyal,Nipun Kwatra,Ramachandran Ramjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that increases the efficiency of long-context LLM inference by reusing Top-k indices across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms are the primary bottleneck of latency in long-context LLMs, which are crucial in reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Improving efficiency in attention computation can significantly enhance performance.

Method: Kascade computes and reuses Top-k indices from anchor layers to intermediate layers, leveraging cross-layer similarity. Anchor layers are selected dynamically using a development set. The implementation is optimized to handle operations efficiently in both prefill and decode attention.

Result: Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x in prefill attention compared to FlashAttention-3 baseline while maintaining similar accuracy on long-context benchmarks like LongBench and AIME-24.

Conclusion: Kascade demonstrates that sparse, reusable attention indices can significantly optimize both the speed and accuracy of long-context LLMs, reducing computational costs in practical workloads.

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

*Barna Pásztor,Thomas Kleine Buening,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF) for preference optimization, which uses a sequential game theory approach to achieve better alignment compared to RLHF and NLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) in preference optimization, which struggle with capturing complex and rich preference structures effectively.

Method: The authors introduce SLHF, which frames alignment as a sequential game between a Leader (commits actions) and a Follower (refines actions). This framework allows for iterative improvements, leveraging the asymmetry of sequential play while also enabling inference-time refinement through iterative sampling.

Result: SLHF demonstrates strong alignment capabilities across diverse preference datasets, scales effectively to models ranging from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and provides refinements transferrable to different model families without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SLHF offers a robust, consistent, and data-sensitive approach to preference optimization, outperforming RLHF and NLHF in capturing complex preference structures while enabling scalable and transferable model refinements.

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

TL;DR: This paper presents Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a method that enhances federated learning by integrating semantic and domain constraints into distributed optimization to improve convergence and privacy under non-IID data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow convergence and privacy-utility trade-offs in federated learning under non-IID data by leveraging domain knowledge constraints.

Method: The authors propose SCFA, a framework that incorporates domain knowledge constraints into federated optimization, with convergence guarantees. They validate it theoretically and empirically using manufacturing data and domain-specific knowledge graphs.

Result: SCFA achieved faster convergence (22% improvement), reduced model divergence by 41.3%, and improved privacy-utility trade-offs with significant performance advantages over standard federated learning approaches.

Conclusion: SCFA effectively integrates constraints to reduce heterogeneity, improve utility, and accelerate convergence in federated learning, with demonstrated theoretical and empirical robustness.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

*Zhengtao Jake Gan,Xiaoyu Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents dimensionless learning, a method that uses machine learning to discover physical laws and dimensionless numbers from experimental data, combining classical dimensional analysis with neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and extract interpretable physical laws from complex experimental data using dimensionless analysis and machine learning.

Method: The method starts by identifying dimensionless groups from experimental data, employs neural networks to find optimal combinations, and uses a regularization technique to ensure interpretable coefficients. It systematically assesses the method's performance under noise and sampling variations.

Result: The method effectively identifies single or multiple dimensionless numbers, remains robust against noise, and captures equivalent representations of underlying physics in data.

Conclusion: While the approach shows promise, challenges such as computational cost, data dependency, automated variable selection, and practical tool development need addressing for broader adoption.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework, trained on CFD data, to predict thrombosis risks in rotary blood pumps efficiently and transparently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational models struggle with predicting thrombosis risks due to complex flow conditions and incomplete understanding of flow features' roles.

Method: The study employs a logistic regression model with a feature-selection pipeline, trained on CFD-derived flow data, to predict thrombosis risks in spatial patterns.

Result: The model accurately predicts thrombosis risk regions, is trained in one scenario, and generalizes well to another device (centrifugal pump).

Conclusion: This framework links flow features to thrombosis risks efficiently, complements physics-based models, and enables affordable thrombosis risk assessment and device design.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study applies Federated Learning to improve the diagnosis of collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), achieving an F1-score of 0.82 compared to 0.57-0.75 for single-organization models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare disease diagnosis, like COL6-RD, suffers from data scarcity and privacy-related obstacles, necessitating new methods to enable collaborative model training.

Method: The study employed a global Federated Learning initiative via the Sherpa.ai platform using decentralized microscopy image datasets from two international organizations.

Result: The approach produced a model capable of classifying pathogenic groups of COL6-RD, outperforming traditional single-institution models with an F1-score improvement.

Conclusion: Federated Learning is shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, generalizability, and interpretation while preserving data privacy, with potential applications in variant analysis and sequencing prioritization.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CSA-TTA, a framework for improving intraoperative hypotension prediction through cross-sample training and patient-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately predicting intraoperative hypotension (IOH), a condition with significant surgical risks, particularly due to its patient-specific nature and rarity.

Method: CSA-TTA builds a Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework by creating a cross-sample bank of historical hypotensive and non-hypotensive data. It uses K-Shape clustering for coarse-to-fine retrieval of training samples, paired with self-supervised learning techniques to adapt the model to intraoperative dynamics.

Result: CSA-TTA was validated on the VitalDB and an in-hospital dataset, embedded into advanced forecasting models like TimesFM and UniTS, achieving notable gains in recall and F1 scores—showcasing improved robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances predictions of IOH by leveraging cross-sample training data, demonstrating its potential for clinical integration and real-world benefit in surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

*Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta,Manisha Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGradSelect is a method for efficient fine-tuning of Small Language Models (SLMs), reducing resource usage while maintaining high performance by selectively updating transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly, particularly for memory and resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) solutions like LoRA reduce costs but limit training efficiency, especially for Small Language Models (SLMs) where efficiency is critical.

Method: AdaGradSelect selectively updates transformer blocks based on gradient norms. It employs Dirichlet-based sampling for block selection based on past updates and an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration, balancing exploration and exploitation across training epochs.

Result: AdaGradSelect is 12% faster, uses 35% less GPU memory, and achieves performance close to full fine-tuning. It outperforms LoRA by about 3% on GSM8K and delivers comparable accuracy on MATH datasets.

Conclusion: AdaGradSelect is a more resource-efficient and effective fine-tuning method compared to traditional approaches, particularly for Small Language Models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Graph Neural Networks can effectively complement physics-based models by enriching simulations, reducing data dependency, and enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

*Ye Li,Jiahe Feng,Yuan Meng,Kangye Ji,Chen Tang,Xinwan Wen,Shutao Xia,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-DP, a speculative decoding framework for Diffusion Policy (DP), achieving faster inference and temporal adaptivity in embodied control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of high inference latency and computational cost in Diffusion Policy, particularly for time-varying difficulty tasks in embodied control.

Method: They propose a framework, TS-DP, which includes a Transformer-based drafter to replace costly denoising calls and an RL-based scheduler to adaptively adjust speculative parameters based on task difficulty.

Result: TS-DP achieves up to 4.17x faster inference rates with over 94% of drafts accepted, reaching real-time inference capabilities at 25 Hz without performance loss.

Conclusion: Temporal-aware speculative decoding can significantly improve the efficiency of diffusion-based control in dynamic embodied tasks while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

### [250] [Boosting t-SNE Efficiency for Sequencing Data: Insights from Kernel Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15900)
*Avais Jan,Prakash Chourasia,Sarwan Ali,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates nine kernel functions for t-SNE on biological sequence data and identifies cosine similarity as the most effective for visualization and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for t-SNE rely on Gaussian kernels, which are less effective for biological sequences due to lack of data-dependence and computational inefficiency. This paper aims to find a better kernel for analyzing categorical biological data.

Method: The study tests nine kernels with three embedding approaches: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Evaluation includes visualization metrics and classification/clustering on six biological datasets.

Result: Cosine similarity kernel outperformed others, showing better runtime efficiency, neighborhood preservation, and robustness in downstream tasks across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Kernel selection significantly affects the effectiveness of t-SNE for biological data. The cosine similarity kernel is optimal for improving visualization, runtime efficiency, and analysis quality across various scenarios.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

*Nuria Alina Chandra,Yucen Lily Li,Alan N. Amin,Alex Ali,Joshua Rollins,Sebastian W. Ober,Aniruddh Raghu,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies three discrete diffusion methods (discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial) through a single underlying Wright-Fisher genetic model, unlocking practical applications and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face challenges in choosing between discrete space diffusion, Gaussian diffusion, and simplicial diffusion due to their distinct trade-offs and limitations. A unified framework is lacking to connect these methods and enable cross-utilization.

Method: The authors develop a theory demonstrating that discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion are all parameterizations of the Wright-Fisher model, deriving formal connections between their likelihoods and hyperparameters. They further stabilize simplicial diffusion through insights from genetics literature.

Result: The theory allows for modeling discrete diffusion in a unified way and enables training a single model that operates across all three domains. They report improved stability and performance in DNA generation using Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion.

Conclusion: The work successfully unifies three major diffusion methods and reduces trade-offs for practitioners, providing a flexible and effective modeling approach across multiple discrete-sequence domains.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

*Lucas Monteiro Paes,Nivedha Sivakumar,Yinong Oliver Wang,Masha Fedzechkina Donaldson,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method, Direct Steering Optimization (DSO), for reducing bias in generative models while maintaining performance and allowing inference-time control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in generative models like vision-language models and provide users control over balancing bias mitigation with model performance.

Method: Reinforcement learning is used to optimize linear transformations for activation steering, achieving a balance between fairness and model performance.

Result: DSO outperforms existing methods in achieving a trade-off between fairness and performance, demonstrating its effectiveness on both VLMs and LLMs.

Conclusion: Designing steering strategies directly optimized for bias mitigation results in more effective control of model behavior than heuristic methods.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification, designed for accuracy in an underexplored and challenging domain. It outperforms existing methods using a novel pretraining and fine-tuning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate DNA barcode-based taxonomic classification in fungi, a domain where traditional supervised methods underperform due to sparse labeling and long-tailed taxonomic distributions.

Method: The method leverages a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm using a state-space model architecture, with enhancements like hierarchical label smoothing, weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer.

Result: BarcodeMamba+ demonstrates improved performance in fungal classification benchmarks, outperforming traditional and existing methods, across varying taxonomic levels and data distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The work introduces an advanced classification tool for fungal taxonomy, offering scalability and effectiveness for genomic biodiversity research. It establishes a robust training framework in a sparse data domain.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Transformers can effectively exploit unlabeled contextual demonstrations for learning under sparse or absent labeled data conditions.

Method: The authors introduce and analyze IC-SSL, where Transformers process a small set of labeled examples alongside many unlabeled examples to develop context-dependent representations.

Result: Transformers can utilize unlabeled contexts to achieve robust and improved predictions, especially in settings with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational understanding of how Transformers use unlabeled data within in-context learning to enhance representation and performance in semi-supervised setups.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SALVE, a framework to interpret and control deep neural networks through feature discovery, validation, and model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks deliver high performance but lack interpretability and control. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: SALVE uses an $ll_1$-regularized autoencoder to discover sparse features, validates them using Grad-FAM saliency mapping, and modifies model behaviors through weight-space interventions.

Result: The approach demonstrated effective interpretability and control on ResNet-18 and ViT-B/16 models.

Conclusion: SALVE advances transparent and controllable AI by transforming feature discovery into actionable model edits.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

*Andrew Wagenmaker,Perry Dong,Raymond Tsao,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how policy pretraining affects RL finetuning and introduces a novel method called posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) to ensure effective initialization for RL finetuning, achieving better results in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the factors affecting the effectiveness of a pretrained policy as an initialization for RL finetuning, and addressing shortcomings of traditional behavioral cloning.

Method: The authors propose PostBC, a technique that models the posterior distribution of demonstrator behavior instead of matching observed actions, leveraging modern generative models for implementation.

Result: PostBC ensures action coverage, improves RL finetuning performance compared to behavioral cloning, and shows success in robotic tasks and manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: PostBC enhances RL finetuning initialization without compromising pretrained performance, offering a practical and superior approach for domains requiring effective policy pretraining.

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of regulated data categories in decision-tree studies, highlighting implications for privacy laws and suggesting privacy-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the use of regulated data categories in decision-tree studies and understand their implications under European Union and United States privacy laws.

Method: The authors compile a corpus of decision-tree studies, classify predictors into regulated data categories, and link them to privacy law excerpts.

Result: The study found that many predictors in decision-tree studies fall into regulated categories, especially in healthcare, with industry-specific differences and temporal patterns.

Conclusion: The evidence promotes the need for privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, offering insights for broader machine learning practices.

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable and cost-effective method using commodity RFID for tracking assets in forested environments during wildfires, overcoming traditional constraints of tag localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of localizing RFID tags in forest settings where signal attenuation and environmental variability impede current methods, especially when known locations cannot be tagged beforehand.

Method: The authors utilize Gaussian Process modeling of RF signal responses paired with a novel weighted log-likelihood approach to match unknown RF signals to a dictionary of previously modeled environments.

Result: The approach achieves tag localization accuracies comparable to GPS, using passive RFID systems without the need for tagging known locations in advance.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for wildfire asset tracking that operates on passive RFID with localization accuracy comparable to GPS at significantly lower costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR-RL, a framework for dynamically optimizing the rank in Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) of LLMs using reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static rank assumptions in traditional low-rank approximations are inflexible in handling diverse input data in MHSA. There is a need for adaptable methods that manage computational efficiency while maintaining model performance.

Method: The DR-RL framework uses reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize rank selection, guided by sequence dynamics and hardware constraints. It incorporates a Transformer-based policy network, online matrix perturbation bounds, and batched SVD to adjust ranks in real-time without full decomposition.

Result: DR-RL achieves computational efficiency by reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) while maintaining downstream accuracy equivalent to full-rank attention, especially for long input sequences (L > 4096).

Conclusion: DR-RL effectively balances computational efficiency and attention fidelity in MHSA, providing a mathematically grounded alternative to static and heuristic rank reduction methods in large-scale deep learning applications.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving PDEs is computationally expensive, and existing ROMs face limitations in predictive accuracy over long time periods.

Method: The authors propose a high-order finite-difference scheme alongside a Rollout loss function to train ROMs for improved accuracy.

Result: The approach is applied to the 2D Burgers equation, showcasing better long-term prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: The work enhances the ability of ROMs to provide accurate, computationally efficient solutions for families of PDEs over extensive time horizons.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: SNAC-Pack demonstrates potential for hardware-aware architecture searches and offers tools for efficient FPGA implementations, advancing deployments in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search is a powerful approach for automating model design, but existing methods struggle to accurately optimize for real hardware performance, often relying on proxy metrics such as bit operations. We present Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack), an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks focusing on FPGA deployment. SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware neural architecture search for resource-constrained deployments and provides an open-source framework for automating the design of efficient FPGA-accelerated models.

TL;DR: FTBSC-KGML introduces a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based machine learning framework for accurate agroecosystem carbon emission estimates, emphasizing spatial variability and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods inadequately quantify agroecosystem carbon cycles at granular, decision-relevant scales due to challenges in spatial variability exploitation and transfer learning.

Method: The paper introduces FTBSC-KGML, a machine learning framework that integrates pretraining, fine-tuning, and site-specific parameters to leverage spatial heterogeneity and transfer learning using remote-sensing data.

Result: FTBSC-KGML improves local accuracy in estimating carbon emissions under limited data conditions, showing lower error rates and better explanatory consistency compared to global models.

Conclusion: FTBSC-KGML successfully enhances the spatial and interpretative precision of agroecosystem carbon cycle assessments, addressing variability comprehensively.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price,Luis Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a design optimization framework using reinforcement learning to reduce costs for heat-pipe microreactors, achieving over 57% cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe variants, are ideal for remote areas relying heavily on costly fossil fuels but face financial and scaling challenges.

Method: Random samples train surrogate models like Gaussian processes and multi-layer perceptrons. These surrogates are combined with reinforcement learning frameworks to optimize reactor designs for cost and performance.

Result: The framework identified key cost contributors and effectively reduced the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by over 57% while maintaining constraints on reactor performance.

Conclusion: Integrating physics and economic analyses in early design stages significantly enhances the viability of cost-effective microreactor systems. Future work focuses on deeper multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

### [265] [In-Context Multi-Operator Learning with DeepOSets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16074)
*Shao-Ting Chiu,Aditya Nambiar,Ali Syed,Jonathan W. Siegel,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies DeepOSets' capacity for in-context learning. It demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to unseen PDE solution operators using examples in prompts, without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and expand the applicability of in-context learning beyond autoregressive transformer architectures and show that DeepOSets can recover solution operators of unseen PDEs.

Method: DeepOSets architecture was appropriately modified to act as a multi-operator in-context learner and experimentally tested on Poisson and reaction-diffusion PDE problems.

Result: DeepOSets demonstrated in-context learning for unseen PDE problems and proved to be a universal uniform approximator of continuous operators.

Conclusion: DeepOSets provides a novel, non-attention-based avenue for in-context learning and holds promise for extending scientific machine learning capabilities.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

### [266] [Privacy Blur: Quantifying Privacy and Utility for Image Data Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16086)
*Saeed Mahloujifar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Chuan Guo,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the privacy-utility tradeoff of image obfuscation techniques like Gaussian blur, pixelization, DP-Pix, and cropping, concluding that Gaussian blur offers the least privacy, while pixelization and DP-Pix can achieve better privacy and utility at appropriate settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to ensure privacy in image data released for model training without compromising utility, addressing the limitations of widely used methods like Gaussian blurring.

Method: The study assesses privacy via reversal and discrimination attacks and utility through model performance on obfuscated datasets. It benchmarks Gaussian blur against pixelization, DP-Pix, and cropping.

Result: Gaussian blur is found to be the least private due to susceptibility to reversal attacks, whereas pixelization and DP-Pix demonstrate a better balance of privacy and utility across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Pixelization and DP-Pix provide better privacy-preserving obfuscation than Gaussian blurring, making them more suitable for responsible data release, and are made available in the Privacy Blur software package.

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIMM, an AI-driven system that detects market manipulation by analyzing Reddit activity, coordination patterns, and market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market manipulation increasingly stems from coordinated social media campaigns, highlighting the need for tools that link online narratives to trading behavior.

Method: AIMM integrates data from Reddit (synthetically calibrated features), bot indicators, and historical market data (OHLCV) to generate daily Manipulation Risk Scores for stocks.

Result: AIMM flagged GameStop manipulation 22 days before its peak in January 2021. Despite a small labeled dataset, it shows potential for early detection of social media-driven market manipulation events.

Conclusion: The AIMM framework and its accompanying dataset, evaluation methods, and dashboard aim to advance research in detecting social media-driven financial manipulation.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

*Hamed Ajorlou,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Geert Leus,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BUILD, a deterministic algorithm for recovering DAGs using the ensemble precision matrix under linear Gaussian SEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods to recover directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data under linear Gaussian SEM, which is crucial for causal discovery and machine learning.

Method: The BUILD algorithm identifies leaf nodes and their parents using the structure of the ensemble precision matrix, pruning leaves iteratively and periodically re-estimating the precision matrix to mitigate errors.

Result: On synthetic benchmarks, BUILD demonstrates favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, balancing runtime and robustness.

Conclusion: BUILD provides a structured and explicit approach to DAG recovery, offering advantages in performance and control of computational complexity.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning, which removes training data from trained models, introduces privacy risks to retained data under dual-view settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore unexamined privacy risks to retained data introduced by machine unlearning, especially considering adversaries querying both original and unlearned models.

Method: The paper introduces "privacy knowledge gain" theoretically and proposes DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which uses lightweight likelihood ratio inference for efficient black-box membership inference attack.

Result: DVIA effectively extracts membership information on retained data and experiments validate its efficiency across datasets and models.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning introduces amplified privacy risks, particularly in dual-view settings, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal framework for Alzheimer's disease detection using graph-based analysis of hand-drawn cube sketches, combining these with demographic and neuropsychological test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the clinical challenge of early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease by leveraging the visuospatial assessment from cube-copying tasks.

Method: Cube drawings are converted into graph-based representations, encoding spatial, topological, and geometric features. These are analyzed with graph neural networks, and combined with demographic and neuropsychological test data using a late-fusion model.

Result: Graph-based models outperformed pixel-based methods in classification performance and improved robustness to class imbalance. The SHAP analysis identified key graphical features aligning with clinical observations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that graph-based analysis of cube drawings is a promising, interpretable, and scalable method for non-invasive Alzheimer's screening.

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces stMFG, a novel deep learning model to improve spatial domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to effectively combine spatial and gene expression features due to separate processing, limiting interactive analysis.

Method: stMFG introduces layer-wise cross-view attention in a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network, coupled with cross-view contrastive learning and spatial constraints.

Result: On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG demonstrates up to 14% ARI improvement over existing methods on specific slices.

Conclusion: The proposed stMFG approach effectively integrates spatial and gene features for improved spatial domain identification and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

TL;DR: The study proposes a machine learning model for predicting geohazard runout accurately and efficiently across diverse terrains and flow types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of predicting geohazard runout, which is critical for protecting human lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems, while overcoming the limitations of current models regarding their trade-off between realism and computational speed.

Method: The study uses machine learning, training the model on over 100,000 numerical simulations across 10,000 real-world terrain samples to predict flow extent and deposit thickness, incorporating physically realistic behaviors.

Result: The machine learning model predicts geohazard runout 100 to 10,000 times faster than traditional numerical solvers, while maintaining high accuracy and reproducing key flow behaviors like avulsion and deposition patterns across diverse terrains.

Conclusion: Neural emulation offers a viable path for rapid and accurate geohazard runout predictions, enabling better disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting at large spatial and temporal scales, supporting early warning systems.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

TL;DR: DataFlow is an LLM-driven data preparation framework with system-level abstractions, offering modular transformations, reusable operators, and automatic pipeline planning for enhanced scalability, reproducibility, and model-driven results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The burgeoning demand for high-quality LLM data faces barriers like ad-hoc data preparation, lack of modular abstractions, poor reproducibility, and weak support for model-in-the-loop systems.

Method: The approach introduces DataFlow, an LLM data preparation framework providing modular, composable pipelines with nearly 200 operators, an intuitive API, and an automatic translation agent for pipeline creation.

Result: DataFlow outperformed human-curated and synthetic data in benchmark tests, achieving significant accuracy improvements, including +3% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL and 7% gains in code tasks.

Conclusion: DataFlow represents a scalable, reproducible, and high-performance solution for LLM data preparation, establishing a foundational system for future data-centric AI efforts.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

*Xueqi Ma,Xingjun Ma,Sarah Monazam Erfani,Danilo Mandic,James Bailey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework, which enhances graph neural networks' ability to both detect and classify out-of-distribution samples using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in current methods for open-set classification, which treat out-of-distribution samples as a single class, without providing deeper insights or probable labels required in high-stake scenarios like fraud detection and medical diagnosis.

Method: The method involves a three-component framework: a coarse classifier using large language model prompts for initial OOD detection and label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained for enhanced detection/classification, and refined OOD classification via LLM prompts and post-processing. It uses semantic OOD instances rather than synthetic data for improved interpretability.

Result: CFC improves out-of-distribution detection by 10% over existing methods and achieves up to 70% accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CFC framework demonstrates advanced capabilities in both detecting and classifying OOD samples with high accuracy and interpretability, offering practical utility in critical applications.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

TL;DR: AI models trained on historical data like the New York Times Annotated Corpus may carry biases that impact their function in journalism-related apps, highlighting concerns about their effect in modern contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the embedded biases in AI models trained on historical text data, particularly in newsroom and research settings, revealing the challenges of using AI tools responsibly in journalism.

Method: Quantitative and qualitative analysis using explainable AI tools was applied to study the 'blacks' thematic topic label's operation in a multi-label classifier trained on the New York Times Annotated Corpus.

Result: The 'blacks' label acted as a 'racism detector' across minority groups but performed poorly in modern scenarios such as anti-Asian hate reporting during COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter stories.

Conclusion: AI tools can reproduce historical biases in news contexts, posing risks for applications like story discovery and summarization while urging cautious adoption and bias mitigation in newsroom workflows.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy issues in graph neural networks for real-world data by introducing a federated learning algorithm (SEAL) that improves generalization and classification accuracy under data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the privacy concerns and data heterogeneity challenges in centralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) for large-scale real-world graph data.

Method: The authors propose the SEAL algorithm, which minimizes both the loss function and its sharpness while introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix to mitigate dimensional collapse in local graph representations.

Result: SEAL demonstrates enhanced classification accuracy and generalization capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) federated graph learning methods in experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SEAL algorithm effectively addresses challenges in federated graph learning (privacy, heterogeneity, dimensional collapse), proving its utility for large-scale graph classification tasks.

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

### [278] [Sharpness-aware Second-order Latent Factor Model for High-dimensional and Incomplete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16277)
*Jialiang Wang,Xueyan Bao,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model to improve optimization in second-order latent factor models, which are used for HDI data, by leveraging sharpness-aware minimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Second-order Latent Factor models face challenges in optimization due to their bilinear and non-convex structure. The motivation is to utilize sharpness-aware minimization techniques to address these optimization issues and improve performance.

Method: The Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model introduces second-order information acquisition via Hessian-vector products and integrates a sharpness term into the curvature using these products, aimed at improving optimization and generalization.

Result: Experiments on numerous industrial datasets show that the SSLF model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed SSLF model tackles the optimization challenges of Second-order Latent Factor models, yielding consistent improvements and practical superiority on industrial datasets.

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [279] [Exploration v.s. Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912)
*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how spurious rewards and entropy minimization impact reasoning in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models, highlighting their role in improving mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplained dynamics in RLVR, where discouraging both exploitation and exploration simultaneously improves reasoning, and to uncover the mechanisms behind these effects.

Method: The paper investigates the relationship between policy entropy and performance, and the effects of spurious rewards, exploring concepts like clipping bias and reward misalignment to explain reasoning improvements.

Result: Clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, fostering confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone does not yield the same improvement.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into how spurious rewards enhance RLVR reasoning and introduces principles for achieving more effective training in the framework.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

*Jinhao Zhang,Yunquan Zhang,Daning Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel quantization method for large language models that selectively applies the best algorithm based on layer-specific characteristics, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training quantization methods use a uniform strategy across all network layers, ignoring layer-specific characteristics and leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed method is called CKA Guided Modular Quantization, using Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to evaluate and select the optimal quantization strategy for each layer, creating a hybrid quantized model through independent evaluation.

Result: The new method surpasses traditional uniform quantization and state-of-the-art mixed precision methods, achieving lower perplexity and better downstream task performance across models like LLaMA and Qwen.

Conclusion: CKA Guided Modular Quantization is effective for fine-tuning-free, layer-specific optimization, setting a new standard for post-training quantization in large language models.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

*Taozhao Chen,Linghan Huang,Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SRMU, a novel technique designed to address the challenges of unlearning sensitive knowledge in large language models operating in settings with entangled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks like privacy leakage and regulatory non-compliance when using large language models in safety-critical sectors, effective unlearning mechanisms are essential.

Method: The proposed method, SRMU (Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning), selectively suppresses harmful representations by employing structured misdirection vectors and activation importance mapping.

Result: Experiments on the WMDP benchmark show SRMU achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, even in scenarios with 20-30% entangled overlap where conventional methods fail.

Conclusion: SRMU offers a robust approach for ensuring compliance, safety, and controlled knowledge removal in LLM applications, making it valuable for regulated domains.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address data scarcity and heterogeneity in battery cycle life prediction, limiting progress in battery research, manufacturing, and deployment.

Method: The study develops the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), leveraging domain-knowledge-driven mixture-of-expert layers and training on 13 lithium-ion battery datasets. It employs transfer learning to adapt the model to diverse conditions.

Result: PBT outperformed existing models by an average of 19.8% in accuracy and achieved state-of-the-art life prediction performance across 15 datasets with varying operating conditions, protocols, and chemistries.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for universal battery lifetime prediction systems by establishing the first foundation model for battery cycle life prediction.

Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.

*Zhenjiang Zhao,Takahisa Toda,Takashi Kitamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness verification in tree ensembles, introducing a method for efficient quantification that provides refined bounds and diagnoses biased regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fairness verification by quantitatively estimating bias regions and counterexample ratios, addressing limitations of existing methods focused on neural networks.

Method: The authors propose an efficient quantification technique exploiting tree ensemble structures, overcoming prior framework limitations of scalability and bounds estimation.

Result: Experiments on five datasets confirm the method’s improved performance for fairness testing compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: This approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fairness verification for tree ensembles, providing better diagnostic capability and scalability.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

*Ruifeng Xu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method to tackle challenges in optimizing water-nitrogen combinations and resource efficiency in crop growth, achieving improvements in yield and productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in crop yield optimization caused by the complexity of water-nitrogen management and difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals, which impede dynamic resource utilization and sustainability.

Method: The study introduces a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) framework. A parent agent optimizes macroscopic irrigation and fertilization strategies while a child agent dynamically adjusts daily strategies based on stress factors and mixed probability distributions.

Result: The method was validated using DSSAT simulation and field data, leading to a 4.7% yield increase, 5.6% and 5.1% higher water productivity, and 6.3% and 1.0% better nitrogen productivity across two years.

Conclusion: The NDRL method successfully addresses complexities in water-nitrogen management and improves yield and resource efficiency, providing a promising approach for sustainable agricultural practices.

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO) and a grid-invariant network (GLNONet) for learning mappings in function spaces, addressing issues like non-periodicity and irregular geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve limitations in existing neural operator methods for learning in inconsistent input spaces, especially with non-periodic excitations, transient dynamics, and irregular/non-Euclidean domains.

Method: Proposes a generalized operator learning framework using pole-residue decomposition with exponential basis functions, embedded into the Laplace-Beltrami operator's eigen-basis, enabling robust adaptations to Riemannian manifolds.

Result: Achieves robust and state-of-the-art performance in experiments involving PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The GLNO framework and GLNONet architecture effectively generalize operator learning to aperiodic, irregular, and non-uniform geometries, offering a significant advance in computational modeling.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

*Filippo Zacchei,Paolo Conti,Attilio Alberto Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme to efficiently solve inverse uncertainty quantification problems using multi-fidelity neural networks and heterogeneous low- and high-fidelity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse UQ tasks are computationally demanding due to repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers like those used for PDEs. Traditional approaches, e.g., full-order finite element solvers, make sampling methods such as MCMC infeasible.

Method: A Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance framework with neural networks integrates coarse solvers of varying fidelities. High-fidelity evaluations are restricted to offline training. Online evaluations rely on combining coarse solver outputs via trained neural networks.

Result: The method demonstrates improved accuracy, better mixing, and computational efficiencies in posterior inference on benchmark problems of groundwater flow and reaction-diffusion.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces high-fidelity simulation cost while maintaining accuracy, providing flexibility and computational savings in Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates fairness risks in multi-agent predictive systems, particularly in financial applications, revealing emergent bias patterns that arise from collective behaviors rather than individual agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective fairness evaluation in multi-agent systems, which can pose risks in high-stakes domains like consumer finance.

Method: Large-scale simulations are performed in the financial tabular domain with diverse multi-agent setups, analyzing fairness metrics under varying communication and collaboration mechanisms.

Result: The study uncovers emergent biases in multi-agent systems that cannot be linked to individual agents, stressing the need for evaluating these systems holistically.

Conclusion: Fairness evaluation methodologies must assess multi-agent decision systems as entire entities due to collective behaviors' influence on outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using CNN and HOSVD to classify leukemic cells in IoT-based medical setups, achieving 98.88% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient, accurate leukemia detection due to limitations in manual methods prone to human error and time consumption.

Method: A Convolutional Neural Network coupled with Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition was used for classification of leukemic cells in IoMT structure.

Result: The framework was tested on ALL-IDB2 database, reporting an average classification accuracy of 98.88%.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves cancer diagnosis efficiency through IoMT integration and AI, enabling near real-time leukemia detection and communication for clinicians and patients.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to create fully integer-based quantised neural networks (QNNs) without batch normalization (BN), offering competitive accuracy for edge and embedded device inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch normalization layers hinder true integer-only deployment in quantised neural networks, which are critical for energy-efficient inference on resource-constrained devices.

Method: The authors propose a progressive, layer-wise distillation training scheme, starting with a pretrained BN-enabled teacher network to create a BN-free, integer-only student network.

Result: The BN-free QNN achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet with AlexNet under aggressive low-bit quantization, enabling integer-only inference.

Conclusion: The approach integrates well with standard workflows, making it practical for deploying energy-efficient neural networks in constrained environments.

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

*Daniël Bot,Leland McInnes,Jan Aerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLSCAN is introduced as a novel density-based clustering algorithm that addresses hyperparameter selection challenges, outperforming HDBSCAN* in performance and maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve clustering methods for exploratory data analysis by addressing the challenges of hyperparameter selection in density-based clustering, particularly for algorithms like HDBSCAN*.

Method: PLSCAN utilizes scale-space clustering principles and persistent homology on a novel metric space to identify all minimum cluster sizes for stable clusters efficiently.

Result: PLSCAN outperforms HDBSCAN* in clustering performance (e.g., higher ARI) and is less sensitive to hyperparameter changes. It also demonstrates competitive computational performance compared to other algorithms.

Conclusion: PLSCAN provides a more robust and efficient solution to density-based clustering with fewer dependency on hyperparameters, making it ideal for exploratory data analyses.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of sparsity, stochasticity, class imbalance, and irregular timings in predicting user purchase behavior for real-time bidding in advertising systems.

Method: Propose Abacus, a novel strategy predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events, paired with hybrid objectives merging sequential learning with aggregated statistics.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show Abacus pretraining accelerates task convergence and achieves up to +6.1% improvement in AUC compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines temporal evolution tracking and aggregated statistics, offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy for display advertising systems.

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

### [293] [Exploiting Radio Frequency Fingerprints for Device Identification: Tackling Cross-receiver Challenges in the Source-data-free Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16648)
*Liu Yang,Qiang Li,Luxiong Wen,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-SHOT, a method to improve the practical deployment of Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) systems by adapting models between receivers without source domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the distribution shifts caused by hardware differences when deploying deep learning-based RFFI models across different receivers, which limits their practical effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), which uses momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and global structural constraints to improve model adaptation between receivers.

Result: MS-SHOT demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches in addressing source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

Conclusion: MS-SHOT offers a reliable and scalable solution for cross-receiver device authentication, overcoming key challenges such as label shift and non-uniform class distributions.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

Motivation: To perform a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of different algorithms (machine learning, deep learning, and neuro-symbolic AI) in text classification tasks and assess their performance on different text representations and feature extraction methods.

Method: A comparative analysis involving machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.), deep learning approaches, and NeSy is conducted. Various text representations (TF-IDF, USE, RoBERTa) and feature extraction techniques (Chi-Square, Mutual Information) are employed.

Result: The neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy) approach exhibited performance comparable to robust MLP results, even with a limited dataset.

Conclusion: The study highlights NeSy’s potential as an effective approach for text classification. Future research will explore additional knowledge bases, diverse embeddings, and refined hyperparameters to enhance the effectiveness of NeSy.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

*John M. Statheros,Hairong Wang,Richard Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLARiTy, a vision transformer-based model for multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies using chest X-rays. It achieves high performance and precise localization with innovative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in accurately identifying and localizing multiple chest pathologies using X-rays due to limited dense annotations for spatial data. This paper aims to address that limitation.

Method: The authors propose CLARiTy, a vision transformer-based model using multiple class-specific tokens, SegmentCAM with anatomical priors, and distillation from ConvNeXtV2 for joint classification and localization. They conducted tests using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset.

Result: CLARiTy-S-16-512 delivers competitive classification over 14 pathologies and achieves state-of-the-art localization performance for 8 pathologies, with an improvement of 50.7% over previous approaches, especially for small pathologies.

Conclusion: CLARiTy demonstrates advanced classification and localization capabilities for chest X-ray pathologies, leveraging ViT attention and convolutional techniques. It offers potential use in both high-performance and low-resource settings.

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

Motivation: Existing Predictive Process Mining techniques often face issues of reproducibility, transparency, usability, and benchmarking, making comparisons difficult.

Method: The authors designed SPICE, a Python framework in PyTorch, which reimplements three popular PPM methods and provides rigorous configurability for robust comparison.

Result: SPICE was rigorously compared to original metrics and fair metrics across 11 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SPICE offers a reproducible and transparent solution to improve PPM methodologies and facilitates better comparison of models for business process forecasting.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble-based approach demonstrates superior performance in phishing detection, ensuring high effectiveness with low false positive rates, and successfully adapts to contemporary phishing tactics.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs.

Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enhances a previously proposed machine learning regression framework by introducing a cascade architecture to address the computational and dimensionality challenges of using polyharmonic splines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The initial regression solution using polyharmonic splines faced limitations such as high computational cost (O(N^3)) and breakdown in high-dimensional input spaces, motivating the need for a scalable solution for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Method: The paper introduces a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines and presents efficient matrix procedures for computation and differentiation.

Result: The proposed approach achieves scalability and theoretical justification for handling problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Conclusion: The cascade architecture successfully addresses the computational and dimensionality issues of the previous framework while retaining theoretical rigor, offering an efficient and scalable solution for machine learning regression problems.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

TL;DR: KOSS is a new model improving sequence modeling via context-aware selection mechanisms derived from estimation theory and Kalman gain, delivering superior accuracy and stability in various benchmarks and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selective state space models like Mamba and Mamba-2 excel in sequence modeling but lack theoretical grounding for context-aware selection. This paper seeks to address this gap.

Method: KOSS employs latent state uncertainty minimization, Kalman gain-driven updates, spectral differentiation, and hardware-efficient scanning techniques to ensure efficient and accurate context-dependent selection.

Result: KOSS achieves remarkable accuracy (79% on selective copying task) and reduces MSE by up to 36.23% across nine forecasting benchmarks. It also demonstrates robustness in real-world SSR tracking.

Conclusion: KOSS offers a theoretically grounded and efficient solution to sequence modeling through its closed-loop, context-aware design, outperforming existing models with improved accuracy, stability, and practical applicability.

Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combat increasing digital fraud in the religious tourism sector, which has resulted in financial losses and privacy risks for pilgrims through counterfeit applications.

Method: The study implements and compares the performance of SVM, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes classifiers using a dataset of official and unofficial application data. It uses a hybrid feature extraction method combining TF-IDF and sensitive permission metadata analysis.

Result: The SVM algorithm outperforms others with a 92.3% accuracy, 91.5% precision, and 92.0% F1-score. Key features like legality-related keywords and high-risk permissions such as 'READ PHONE STATE' are identified as critical indicators.

Conclusion: The authors propose this system as a scalable and effective solution to enhance digital trust for religious tourism, with the potential for national adoption in verifying mobile applications.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine GPT architecture with the Energy-based modeling paradigm for improved inference conceptualization.

Method: Using minimal modifications to GPT, inference is framed as token exploration on an energy landscape, sometimes employing gradient descent under certain conditions.

Result: The model performs well in language tasks (e.g., Shakespeare, OpenWebText) and algebraic tasks, with potential resistance to overfitting during extended training.

Conclusion: The eNeRgy-GPT framework offers an innovative perspective, merging GPT and EBM, showing promising performance across diverse domains but requiring further exploration for practical optimization.

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric framework grounded in vector field theory for analyzing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, validated through simulations on biological and physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling and analyzing high-dimensional, non-linear dynamical systems present in complex systems where traditional methods struggle with vast spatio-temporal data.

Method: A geometric framework using a two-parameter family of metrics, vector field theory, and multidimensional scaling for dimensionality reduction and system characterization.

Result: Proposed metrics and multidimensional scaling effectively analyzed spatio-temporal data, enabling dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterization.

Conclusion: The new methodology offers a robust solution for analyzing and understanding complex dynamical systems, particularly data-rich and traditionally hard-to-model scenarios.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEPIC introduces a system that improves memory efficiency by reusing Key Value caches in large language models, achieving significant storage savings for long prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language model (LLM) applications create significant memory pressure due to the repeated processing of long prompt histories containing shared chunks of documents or code. This demands innovative solutions to sustain high throughput and low latency within limited memory.

Method: MEPIC employs position-independent caching (PIC) with enhancements like chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. It uses techniques such as paged storage alignment, block-level recomputation, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion, and fully shareable KV blocks.

Result: MEPIC reduces memory usage by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art PIC systems for similar latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without requiring any model changes.

Conclusion: The system addresses memory constraints effectively, enabling scalable and efficient LLM applications by removing redundancies in KV storage, achieving practicality in long prompt processing.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture leveraging iterations instead of parameter count for high efficiency in embedded aerospace systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedded aerospace systems require efficient neural controllers under strict power, latency, and memory constraints, which large-scale language models fail to meet.

Method: TRC utilizes a compact neural network (1.5M parameters) iteratively through a hierarchical latent structure, driving control refinement without increasing memory usage per iteration.

Result: TRC delivers near-optimal control in nonlinear problems with minimal latency (millisecond-scale inference), taking up less than 10 MB of memory.

Conclusion: Recursive reasoning can transition from discrete tasks to computationally efficient continuous control synthesis, addressing resource limitations in aerospace systems.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaMer, a Meta-RL framework enabling LLM agents to explore and adapt effectively, showing significant performance improvements over RL baselines in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RL-trained agents' struggles with active exploration and adapting from trial-and-error experiences in multi-turn, long-horizon tasks.

Method: LaMer employs a cross-episode training framework for exploration and long-term reward optimization and an in-context policy adaptation method via reflection to adapt policies without gradient updates.

Result: LaMer outperforms RL baselines with 11%-19% performance gains on tasks like Sokoban, MineSweeper, and Webshop, and shows better generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-RL, as implemented in LaMer, effectively induces exploration in LLM agents, promoting robust adaptation strategies for novel environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

*Jiabin Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method for Online Edge ML called Knowledge Transformation (KT), combining techniques to generate pseudo-labels and effectively train models on unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Edge ML methods are limited as they assume static, centrally trained models, which are inefficient against unseen data. The need to update models continuously on edge devices prompted this research.

Method: The KT method integrates Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning to act as a pseudo-labeling oracle, leveraging a teacher model to train a student model with unseen data.

Result: Simulation experiments showed that when using a stable teacher model, KT enables the student model to achieve its expected peak performance over time.

Conclusion: KT proves to be a viable approach for scenarios with pre-trained teacher models or situations where labels are challenging or costly to acquire, enhancing Online Edge ML capabilities.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable intelligent systems to adapt over time by incrementally learning and retaining knowledge without losing previously acquired skills, addressing the challenge of Catastrophic Forgetting.

Method: The paper explores task sequencing, utilizing zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS), to determine optimal task order.

Result: Intelligent task sequencing significantly reduces CF and enhances performance when combined with traditional continual learning strategies. It also has potential applications in curriculum learning.

Conclusion: Task sequencing is an effective method to address CF in Continual Learning, supporting improved adaptability, robustness, and possible applications beyond this domain.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

### [308] [Improving Low-Latency Learning Performance in Spiking Neural Networks via a Change-Perceptive Dendrite-Soma-Axon Neuron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16259)
*Zeyu Huang,Wei Meng,Quan Liu,Kun Chen,Li Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CP-DSA model to improve spiking neural networks' performance through a biology-inspired mechanism and extensive experiments demonstrate its advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of spiking neurons caused by hard reset mechanisms and overly simplified neuron models.

Method: The paper develops a DSA neuron with a soft reset strategy and introduces a CP mechanism to enhance performance, featuring multiple learnable parameters.

Result: The CP-DSA model achieves competitive efficiency in shorter time steps and demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art methods in various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CP-DSA neuron enhances the biological realism, learning potential, and efficiency of spiking networks, validated through theoretical and experimental performance.

Abstract: Spiking neurons, the fundamental information processing units of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), have the all-or-zero information output form that allows SNNs to be more energy-efficient compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the hard reset mechanism employed in spiking neurons leads to information degradation due to its uniform handling of diverse membrane potentials. Furthermore, the utilization of overly simplified neuron models that disregard the intricate biological structures inherently impedes the network's capacity to accurately simulate the actual potential transmission process. To address these issues, we propose a dendrite-soma-axon (DSA) neuron employing the soft reset strategy, in conjunction with a potential change-based perception mechanism, culminating in the change-perceptive dendrite-soma-axon (CP-DSA) neuron. Our model contains multiple learnable parameters that expand the representation space of neurons. The change-perceptive (CP) mechanism enables our model to achieve competitive performance in short time steps utilizing the difference information of adjacent time steps. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the CP-DSA model and the functional characteristics of its internal parameters. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on various datasets substantiate the significant advantages of the CP-DSA model over state-of-the-art approaches.

*Joachim Winther Pedersen,Erwan Plantec,Eleni Nisioti,Marcello Barylli,Milton Montero,Kathrin Korte,Sebastian Risi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs) capable of evolving themselves without external optimizers, demonstrating adaptation and population dynamics similar to natural evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create neural systems that can evolve autonomously, mirroring biological evolution and avoid relying on external optimizers.

Method: The approach unites hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, enabling GHNs to mutate, self-evaluate, and adjust mutation rates based on reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Result: GHNs demonstrate reliable adaptation to environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), emergent population dynamics, and coherent gaits in locomotion benchmarks (Ant-v5), showcasing fine-tuning capabilities.

Conclusion: Self-Referential GHNs establish a step towards synthetic systems that emulate biological evolution, with potential applications in autonomous learning agents and open-ended systems.

Abstract: How can neural networks evolve themselves without relying on external optimizers? We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network. By uniting hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, Self-Referential GHNs mutate and evaluate themselves while adapting mutation rates as selectable traits. Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study examines spiking neural networks (SNNs) as efficient sequence-to-sequence spike processors, establishes their universal representation ability, and shows their strength in handling functions with low complexity or composite structures, emphasizing applications like spike train classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities and computational efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) and classical computing.

Method: The paper analyzes SNNs' representational power by treating them as spike sequence processors, establishes their universal representation property, and quantitatively evaluates their resource efficiency in terms of weights and neurons.

Result: SNNs are shown to effectively represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. Deep SNNs are highlighted for their modular design efficiency in representing composite functions. The work also applies these insights to spike train classification.

Conclusion: This study provides a rigorous theoretical foundation on the representational power of SNNs and reinforces their potential as efficient tools in neuromorphic computing, especially for applications involving spike-based data processing.

Abstract: Inspired by biology, spiking neural networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes over time, offering an energy-efficient alternative to the classical computing paradigm and classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we analyze the representational power of SNNs by viewing them as sequence-to-sequence processors of spikes, i.e., systems that transform a stream of input spikes into a stream of output spikes. We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design. As an application of our results, we discuss spike train classification. Overall, these results contribute to a rigorous foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of spike-based neuromorphic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of scheduling languages being tied to specific compiler ecosystems, hindering comparison, reuse, and evaluation.

### [312] [An Upper Bound on the M/M/k Queue With Deterministic Setup Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16854)
*Jalani Williams,Weina Wang,Mor Harchol-Balter*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of deterministic setup times on multiserver systems' queueing, providing first closed-form waiting time bounds and introducing a novel analysis method (MIST).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern server systems often need to start up after idle periods, incurring setup times which affect queue performance. Understanding their impact on queues is critical for designing cost-efficient systems.

Method: The paper analyzes deterministic setup times in multiserver systems using a new method called the Method of Intervening Stopping Times (MIST), deriving bounds and approximations for average waiting times.

Result: Upper and lower bounds on average waiting times are presented, which are within a constant multiplicative factor of each other. This provides the first comprehensive characterization of finite-server systems with deterministic setup times.

Conclusion: The research significantly advances understanding of multiserver setup systems with realistic setup time assumptions, offering practical equations for system design and introducing a generalizable analysis technique (MIST).

Abstract: In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These "setup times" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.
  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.
  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.

### [313] [LOOPRAG: Enhancing Loop Transformation Optimization with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15766)
*Yijie Zhi,Yayu Cao,Jianhua Dai,Xiaoyang Han,Jingwen Pu,Qingran Wu,Sheng Cheng,Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOOPRAG, a framework aimed at enhancing LLM-based loop optimization with retrieval-augmented guidance and feedback mechanisms, achieving significant speedups over existing compilers and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing effective loop transformation optimizations, which are vital for code performance but remain challenging due to complexities in cost modeling and error-prone LLM outputs.

Method: The LOOPRAG framework employs a parameter-driven approach for loop property utilization, a loop-aware demonstration retrieval mechanism promoting balance in similarity and diversity, and a feedback-driven iterative system to refine LLM outputs through compilation and testing feedback.

Result: LOOPRAG achieves average speedups of up to 11.20×, 14.34×, and 9.29× on the PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE benchmarks, respectively, compared to compilers. It also outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and DeepSeek with speedups of up to 11.97×, 5.61×, and 11.59×.

Conclusion: LOOPRAG significantly improves LLM performance in loop transformation optimization by bridging the gap between LLM shortcomings and the demands of effective optimization, proving its efficacy through substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Loop transformations are semantics-preserving optimization techniques, widely used to maximize objectives such as parallelism. Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\times$, 14.34$\times$, and 9.29$\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\times$, 5.61$\times$, and 11.59$\times$.

*Anastasia Mavridou,Marie Farrell,Gricel Vázquez,Tom Pressburger,Timothy E. Wang,Radu Calinescu,Michael Fisher*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension to NASA's FRET tool for specifying probabilistic requirements through structured natural language, facilitating automated translations into probabilistic temporal logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers struggle to specify requirements for autonomous systems in environments of uncertainty, especially in safety-critical systems. Probabilistic constructs are needed but are too complex for manual specification.

Method: The authors extend NASA's FRET tool to include structured natural language support for probabilistic requirements, automating their translation to probabilistic temporal logic with validation mechanisms in place.

Result: The tool allows developers to accurately specify probabilistic requirements in natural language and translates them into verified logical formulas, enhancing formal analysis in system design.

Conclusion: By automating and simplifying the specification process, this work advances formal analysis for uncertain systems, making it practical and reducing errors in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Integrating autonomous and adaptive behavior into software-intensive systems presents significant challenges for software development, as uncertainties in the environment or decision-making processes must be explicitly captured. These challenges are amplified in safety- and mission-critical systems, which must undergo rigorous scrutiny during design and development. Key among these challenges is the difficulty of specifying requirements that use probabilistic constructs to capture the uncertainty affecting these systems. To enable formal analysis, such requirements must be expressed in precise mathematical notations such as probabilistic logics. However, expecting developers to write requirements directly in complex formalisms is unrealistic and highly error-prone. We extend the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with support for the specification of unambiguous and correct probabilistic requirements, and develop an automated approach for translating these requirements into logical formulas. We propose and develop a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic. To increase trust in our formalizations, we provide assurance that the generated formulas are well-formed and conform to the intended semantics through an automated validation framework and a formal proof. The extended FRET tool enables developers to specify probabilistic requirements in structured natural language, and to automatically translate them into probabilistic temporal logic, making the formal analysis of autonomous and adaptive systems more practical and less error-prone.

### [315] [A Neurosymbolic Approach to Loop Invariant Generation via Weakest Precondition Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15816)
*Daragh King,Vasileios Koutavas,Laura Kovacs*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes NeuroInv, a neurosymbolic method for loop invariant generation, combining neural reasoning and symbolic verification, achieving near-perfect success rates outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the critical bottleneck in automated program verification—loop invariant generation. Current methods lack structured methodologies and alignment with program verification theory.

Method: NeuroInv uses two primary components: (1) a neural module using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Hoare logic for candidate invariant refinement via weakest precondition reasoning, and (2) a symbolic module that repairs invariants iteratively through counterexamples facilitated by OpenJML.

Result: NeuroInv achieves a 99.5% success rate on a benchmark of 150 Java programs and demonstrates scalability in solving more complex verification problems with multiple loops.

Conclusion: NeuroInv proves to be a reliable and scalable solution, dramatically outperforming current techniques, and shows the feasibility of integrating neurosymbolic approaches for enhanced automated program verification.

Abstract: Loop invariant generation remains a critical bottleneck in automated program verification. Recent work has begun to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area, yet these approaches tend to lack a reliable and structured methodology, with little reference to existing program verification theory. This paper presents NeuroInv, a neurosymbolic approach to loop invariant generation. NeuroInv comprises two key modules: (1) a neural reasoning module that leverages LLMs and Hoare logic to derive and refine candidate invariants via backward-chaining weakest precondition reasoning, and (2) a verification-guided symbolic module that iteratively repairs invariants using counterexamples from OpenJML. We evaluate NeuroInv on a comprehensive benchmark of 150 Java programs, encompassing single and multiple (sequential) loops, multiple arrays, random branching, and noisy code segments. NeuroInv achieves a $99.5\%$ success rate, substantially outperforming the other evaluated approaches. Additionally, we introduce a hard benchmark of $10$ larger multi-loop programs (with an average of $7$ loops each); NeuroInv's performance in this setting demonstrates that it can scale to more complex verification scenarios.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to optimize the performance of language models (LMs) when using external tools, through speculative tool calls and other techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of language models on external tools for tasks like web searches and code execution creates performance bottlenecks in the inference process, which this paper seeks to address.

Method: The authors propose novel system optimizations, such as speculative tool calls and keeping sequences resident in the inference engine, as well as suggesting a new tool cache API endpoint for better efficiency.

Result: The paper achieves significant throughput improvements, leading to several hundred additional tokens per second during inference for LM agents.

Conclusion: These optimizations address critical performance challenges associated with tool usage, providing theoretical insights and practical recommendations for better LM inference performance.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for general-purpose robots capable of decision-making across diverse tasks and environments by leveraging video pretraining as the primary modality.

Method: The authors curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, train an open video model for generative robotics planning, and post-process video plans into executable robot actions.

Result: The model demonstrates zero-shot task generalization to novel scenes and tasks, with successful real-world physical execution in wild environments.

Conclusion: This approach proves effective for building robust, generalizable, video-based robot learning systems, encouraging collaborative and reproducible foundation model development.

Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a simulator capable of overcoming the challenges of modeling soft robots, such as nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, while maintaining scalability and high fidelity.

Method: SORS is built on a finite element, energy-based framework that allows modular customization. It utilizes constrained nonlinear optimization via sequential quadratic programming to handle contact scenarios stably and accurately.

Result: Validation experiments, including cantilever deflections, pressure-actuated arms, and contact simulations, demonstrate the simulator's capability to replicate physical behaviors and actuation dynamics with high fidelity.

Conclusion: SORS successfully bridges the gap between simulation and real-world deployment for soft robots, offering extensible, accurate, and usable tools for prototyping and controlling next-gen soft robots.

Abstract: The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $\partial$LITE, a differentiable simulation pipeline for improving image quality in visual inspection trajectories for spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in planning inspection trajectories for satellites in Low Earth Orbit, where lighting conditions, reflections, and relative motions affect the quality of collected data.

Method: They develop $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline using a combination of differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to optimize orbital parameters for better visual sensor data.

Result: $\partial$LITE enables automated design of optimized inspection trajectories, improving data quality and exposing non-obvious strategies in planning satellite inspections.

Conclusion: The approach represents a novel computational solution for spacecraft mission planning, emphasizing the potential of combining simulation and optimization for improved operations.

Abstract: Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

*Qiping Zhang,Nathan Tsoi,Mofeed Nagib,Hao-Tien Lewis Chiang,Marynel Vázquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting human perceptions of robot performance with fewer labeled data during social navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of data-driven machine learning methods in predicting human evaluations of a robot’s behavior which require a substantial amount of labeled data, limiting scalability in human-robot interactions.

Method: Utilized few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs on an augmented dataset of human-robot navigation episodes. Evaluated predictions using spatio-temporal cues in robot and human motions with varying in-context examples and performed ablation studies and personalization experiments.

Result: LLMs matched or outperformed supervised learning models while using fewer labeled examples, with improved prediction performance as more in-context examples and personalized examples were included.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable way to predict human evaluations in human-robot interactions, paving the way for improving socially aware robot behavior using user-centered feedback.

Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi robot payload transport system to carry payloads through an environment of unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining the desired orientation of the payload. For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.

### [322] [SWIFT-Nav: Stability-Aware Waypoint-Level TD3 with Fuzzy Arbitration for UAV Navigation in Cluttered Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16027)
*Shuaidong Ji,Mahdi Bamdad,Francisco Cruz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWIFT-Nav, a TD3-based framework for UAV navigation in cluttered environments, combining fuzzy logic, efficient learning strategies, and obstacle-aware methods for robust and smooth navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and reliable UAV navigation in challenging, cluttered, and dynamic environments has driven the development of new frameworks capable of handling obstacles while providing stable and responsive movement.

Method: SWIFT-Nav integrates a sensor-driven perception module and a TD3 policy. LiDAR is used for safety and goal mapping, and the TD3 policy employs Prioritised Experience Replay and an epsilon-greedy schedule for optimal training. A fuzzy-logic layer ensures safety by moderating actions and switching modes based on environmental conditions.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superiority over baseline navigation methods in trajectory smoothness, generalization to new environments, and maintaining real-time responsiveness.

Conclusion: Combining TD3 with structured exploration, replay prioritisation, and safety-focused fuzzy logic results in an effective and deployable UAV navigation system suitable for complex scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging. We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness. These results show that combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

### [323] [A Task-Driven, Planner-in-the-Loop Computational Design Framework for Modular Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16069)
*Maolin Lei,Edoardo Romiti,Arturo Laurenzi,Rui Dai,Matteo Dalle Vedove,Jiatao Ding,Daniele Fontanelli,Nikos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational framework for modular manipulators, integrating trajectory planning with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. It introduces bi-branch morphologies to address torque constraints and enhances workspace capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular manipulators face challenges in optimizing motion, morphology, and pose while adhering to constraints. Single-branch designs often struggle with torque limits, especially when increasing reach by extending link lengths.

Method: A unified task-driven framework is developed, featuring hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) for motion planning and CMA-ES for design optimization. Virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies.

Result: Simulations and experiments on tasks like polishing and drilling validated the framework. It generates designs satisfying constraints, allows flexible objectives, and achieves larger workspaces without requiring high-capacity modules.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses kinematic, dynamic, and physical challenges, offering adaptable designs for modular manipulators with enhanced capabilities and workspace extension through innovative bi-branch configurations.

Abstract: Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.

Method: The study presents a new simulation platform calibration method featuring vehicle-to-vehicle interaction calibration, accuracy assurance, enhanced efficiency, and pipeline capability. This method fully automates the calibration process.

Result: The proposed method improved interaction replication accuracy by 83.53%, calibration efficiency by 76.75%, and maintained overall accuracy across vehicle and traffic flow levels with a 51.9% improvement compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The new method provides a robust and automated solution for simulating AV and traffic interactions, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art calibration methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method. Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.

### [325] [ManiLong-Shot: Interaction-Aware One-Shot Imitation Learning for Long-Horizon Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16302)
*Zixuan Chen,Chongkai Gao,Lin Shao,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ManiLong-Shot, a new framework for one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) handling long-horizon tasks in robotics through event-driven primitive sequencing, demonstrating superior generalization and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing OSIL methods, which are primarily designed for short-horizon tasks, rendering them inadequate for complex and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Method: The proposed ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events and uses interaction-aware primitives driven by vision-language models (VLM) or rule-based heuristics. It predicts invariant regions, establishes correspondences, and computes end-effector poses for execution.

Result: Experiments showed that ManiLong-Shot achieved a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA in simulation and successfully generalized to unseen long-horizon tasks. Real-robot tests validated its robustness in practical applications.

Conclusion: ManiLong-Shot effectively extends OSIL to long-horizon robotics tasks, significantly improving generalization and practical applicability through event-driven, primitive-based learning.

Abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) offers a promising way to teach robots new skills without large-scale data collection. However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.

### [326] [A2VISR: An Active and Adaptive Ground-Aerial Localization System Using Visual Inertial and Single-Range Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16367)
*Sijia Chen,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ground-aerial collaborative system for robust localization of flying robots in challenging environments, using a combination of active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flying robots often face localization challenges in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Existing approaches rely on fixed cameras observing markers, which have limitations in operational distance and are prone to capture failure.

Method: The system integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. Active vision dynamically detects and tracks markers using a rotatable camera, single-ranging extends operational distance, and measurements are fused using a dimension-reduced estimator with adaptive sliding confidence evaluation.

Result: Experiments under adverse conditions like smoke, illumination changes, and occlusion show the system achieves robust localization with an average error of approximately 0.09 m, demonstrating resilience to sensor failures and loss of capture.

Conclusion: This system improves localization robustness for flying robots under challenging conditions, offering better recognition, coverage, and error minimization while addressing capture loss and sensor failures.

Abstract: It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted) combines vision-language models and terrain sensor analysis to automate reward design for humanoid locomotion. It significantly improves performance, succeeding where manual methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current VLM-based methods, which lack environmental perception and hinder their effectiveness in complex terrains for humanoid locomotion.

Method: E-SDS integrates vision-language models with real-time terrain sensor analysis to create environment-aware reward functions, guided by example videos, for training humanoid locomotion policies.

Result: E-SDS demonstrated superior performance, enabling tasks like stair descent that manual or other automated baselines could not complete. It significantly reduced velocity tracking error and minimized the time required for reward design.

Conclusion: The framework effectively automates reward design for humanoid locomotion, achieving more robust policies and saving significant time and effort compared to manual methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.

*Abhishek Kashyap,Yuxuan Yang,Henrik Andreasson,Todor Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses limited visibility in vision-based robot manipulation by using diffusion models for 3D shape completion from single-view depth observations, improving grasp planning under cluttered conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single camera views in robot manipulation often face occlusion and incomplete geometry, especially in cluttered scenes, causing grasp estimation to perform poorly.

Method: The authors employ diffusion models to achieve category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations, reconstructing full object geometries to enhance grasp planning.

Result: The proposed method improves grasp success rates by 23% compared to a naive baseline and 19% over a recent state-of-the-art shape completion approach in cluttered scenarios.

Conclusion: Using diffusion models for 3D shape completion significantly improves robot grasping performance in cluttered environments.

Abstract: In vision-based robot manipulation, a single camera view can only capture one side of objects of interest, with additional occlusions in cluttered scenes further restricting visibility. As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

Method: The framework combines a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for device mobility forecasting, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism to allocate tasks in real-time.

Result: MPBS showed significant improvements in task completion efficiency and resource utilization in experiments using the real-world GeoLife dataset.

Conclusion: MPBS demonstrates a scalable and adaptive task allocation method tailored to unmanned systems, enhancing their collaboration and performance.

Abstract: As unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) become increasingly important to applications like urban sensing and emergency response, efficiently recruiting these autonomous devices to perform time-sensitive tasks has become a critical challenge. This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues of data redundancy, low-quality images, and heterogeneity caused by overlapping acquisition perspectives and diverse user behaviors in mobile visual crowdsensing.

Method: The method involves a three-stage framework: 1) filtering irrelevant samples based on metadata, 2) using spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize images, and 3) selecting high-quality representative images via visual features and maximum independent set search.

Result: Experiments on real-world and public datasets show that Tri-Select enhances dataset quality and selection efficiency, demonstrating its usefulness for large-scale crowdsensing applications.

Conclusion: Tri-Select offers a robust solution for scalable crowdsensing by effectively reducing redundancy and improving image quality, making it practical for environmental monitoring and similar applications.

Abstract: Mobile visual crowdsensing enables large-scale, fine-grained environmental monitoring through the collection of images from distributed mobile devices. However, the resulting data is often redundant and heterogeneous due to overlapping acquisition perspectives, varying resolutions, and diverse user behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Tri-Select, a multi-stage visual data selection framework that efficiently filters redundant and low-quality images. Tri-Select operates in three stages: (1) metadata-based filtering to discard irrelevant samples; (2) spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize candidate images; and (3) a visual-feature-guided selection based on maximum independent set search to retain high-quality, representative images. Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to replicate animated characters with non-physical proportions and unrealistic movements in the physical world, thereby innovating in mechanical design and stylized robotics control.

Method: Reinforcement learning guided by animation references is used for motion control. Mechanical design innovations include the use of asymmetric legs under a foam skirt, spherical and planar linkages, and temperature-based inputs for actuator safety.

Result: The study validates the effectiveness of the design both in simulations and on physical hardware, achieving a high level of believability for the costumed robotic character.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how innovative mechanical design and reinforcement learning can bring animated characters to life, achieving both stylistic and functional realism in robotics.

Abstract: Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.

Conclusion: VERM demonstrates effective redundancy mitigation and task-relevant feature extraction for efficient robotic manipulation tasks, validated through both simulation and real-world experiments.

Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks for autonomous driving, highlighting two paradigms and their subclasses, as well as challenges for future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modular pipelines for autonomous driving face challenges in dealing with complex scenarios, error propagation, and instruction-following limitations. Advances in multimodal and language-based frameworks motivate exploring Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for more flexible and interpretable driving policies.

Method: The authors categorize VLA methods into two paradigms: End-to-End VLA and Dual-System VLA. They analyze these paradigms based on action generation and guidance mechanisms and summarize relevant datasets and benchmarks for evaluations.

Result: A comprehensive characterization of VLA frameworks has been provided, detailing their structure, distinctions, and challenges while pointing out the evolution from Vision-Action models.

Conclusion: VLA frameworks, unifying visual, linguistic, and actionable reasoning, hold promise for building interpretable, adaptable, and human-aligned autonomous driving solutions. Challenges like robustness and instruction fidelity remain open for future research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to transform human egocentric video data into structured supervision for improving robotic generalization, creating a dataset called E2E-3M, and developing PhysBrain for improved robot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing ways to bridge the gap between human egocentric perception and robot generalization, addressing limitations in robot data collection and creating efficient methods for viewpoint-matched training.

Method: Introduce an Egocentric2Embodiment pipeline that translates egocentric videos into structured supervision for training robots, formulating and using the E2E-3M dataset.

Result: PhysBrain, trained using the E2E-3M dataset, has improved performance in tasks requiring egocentric understanding, demonstrating better planning and sample efficiency in robotic control.

Conclusion: The study shows human egocentric videos can be leveraged to significantly enhance robotic understanding and generalization, enabling practical advancements in embodied AI.

Abstract: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolaRiS, a framework to improve the correlation between simulated and real-world robot policy evaluations, enabling scalable and reliable testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of benchmarking robotic policies due to stochasticity, reproducibility issues, and the time-intensive nature of real-world testing, along with improving the reliability of simulated environments for evaluation.

Method: The authors propose PolaRiS, using neural reconstruction methods to turn video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments, alongside a co-training approach to enhance zero-shot evaluations in simulated environments.

Result: PolaRiS achieves strong correlations between simulation and real-world policy performances and allows rapid, diverse environment creation for better robotic evaluations.

Conclusion: PolaRiS is a step towards scalable, reliable, and democratized evaluation methods for generalist robotic foundational models, addressing key gaps in simulation reliability and diversity.

Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper presents Sceniris, a tool for efficient 3D scene generation, which is 234x faster than the previous method, Scene Synthesizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and efficient 3D scene generation for Physical AI and generative models, which existing methods fail to achieve.

Method: The authors developed Sceniris using batch sampling and faster collision checks, leveraging cuRobo, and provided additional scene relationship options.

Result: Sceniris demonstrated a 234x speed improvement compared to Scene Synthesizer and generated diverse, collision-free 3D scene variations.

Conclusion: Sceniris significantly accelerates 3D synthetic scene generation while providing enhanced functionality, making it suitable for various applications in AI and robotics.

Abstract: Synthetic 3D scenes are essential for developing Physical AI and generative models. Existing procedural generation methods often have low output throughput, creating a significant bottleneck in scaling up dataset creation. In this work, we introduce Sceniris, a highly efficient procedural scene generation framework for rapidly generating large-scale, collision-free scene variations. Sceniris also provides an optional robot reachability check, providing manipulation-feasible scenes for robot tasks. Sceniris is designed for maximum efficiency by addressing the primary performance limitations of the prior method, Scene Synthesizer. Leveraging batch sampling and faster collision checking in cuRobo, Sceniris achieves at least 234x speed-up over Scene Synthesizer. Sceniris also expands the object-wise spatial relationships available in prior work to support diverse scene requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/rai-inst/sceniris

*Balreet Grewal,James Graham,Jeff Muizelaar,Jan Honza Odvarko,Suhaib Mujahid,Marco Castelluccio,Cor-Paul Bezemer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a tool called XBIDetective that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to detect cross-browser inconsistencies in rendering and DOM-based elements by analyzing screenshots from Firefox and Chrome. Evaluation shows strong accuracy in identifying such inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting browser rendering bugs, which are hard to identify due to their dependence on specific conditions. Cross-browser inconsistencies serve as indicators to uncover such hidden bugs.

Method: The authors designed XBIDetective, a tool that uses Vision Language Models. It captures website screenshots on Firefox and Chrome and analyzes them with VLMs to identify inconsistencies.

Result: XBIDetective demonstrates 79% accuracy in identifying cross-browser discrepancies and over 84% accuracy in detecting dynamic elements and advertisements when using a fine-tuned VLM.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that XBIDetective is effective for addressing cross-browser inconsistencies. Its use cases include automated regression testing, large-scale website monitoring, and efficient bug report triaging.

Abstract: Browser rendering bugs can be challenging to detect for browser developers, as they may be triggered by very specific conditions that are exhibited on only a very small subset of websites. Cross-browser inconsistencies (XBIs), variations in how a website is interpreted and displayed on different browsers, can be helpful guides to detect such rendering bugs. Although visual and Document Object Model (DOM)-based analysis techniques exist for detecting XBIs, they often struggle with dynamic and interactive elements. In this study, we discuss our industry experience with using vision language models (VLMs) to identify XBIs. We present the XBIDetective tool which automatically captures screenshots of a website in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and analyzes them with a VLM for XBIs. We evaluate XBIDetective's performance with an off-the-shelf and a fine-tuned VLM on 1,052 websites. We show that XBIDetective can identify cross-browser discrepancies with 79% accuracy and detect dynamic elements and advertisements with 84% and 85% accuracy, respectively, when using the fine-tuned VLM. We discuss important lessons learned, and we present several potential practical use cases for XBIDetective, including automated regression testing, large-scale monitoring of websites, and rapid triaging of XBI bug reports.

*Nishant Gaurav,Adit Akarsh,Tejas Ravishankar,Manoj Bajaj*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Tool-using AI agents face action space, context inefficiency, and probabilistic instability issues that hinder their reliability in handling repetitive tasks. CodeMem addresses these challenges by implementing procedural memory through code for deterministic agentic workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents face challenges like limited action space, inefficiency in maintaining context, and probabilistic instability, especially when compared to platforms like n8n or Zapier that handle repetitive tasks reliably. There is a need for consistency and reliability in AI behavior.

Method: CodeMem proposes integrating procedural memory via code to enable deterministic and reusable workflows that overcome the limitations posed by earlier models, emphasizing stability and reliability.

Result: CodeMem extends the utility of tool-using AI agents by solving the probabilistic stability issue and building deterministic workflows.

Conclusion: By incorporating procedural memory, CodeMem makes AI agents more suitable for reliable repetitive task execution, pushing them closer in functionality to workflow platforms like Zapier and n8n.

Abstract: Current tool-using AI agents suffer from limited action space, context inefficiency, and probabilistic instability that makes them unsuitable for handling repetitive tasks which are otherwise reliably and efficiently tackled by agentic workflows built on platforms like n8n and Zapier. Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability. This paper proposes CodeMem, an architecture to implement procedural memory via code which can be used to build and run reusable agentic workflows with deterministic reliability.

TL;DR: This paper highlights the need for reliable and reproducible LLM-based annotation in empirical software engineering by proposing the Operationalization for LLM-based Annotation Framework (OLAF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues of reliability, reproducibility, and the lack of standardized measures in LLM-based annotation within empirical software engineering.

Method: The paper presents the OLAF framework, focusing on key constructs like reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation, and transparency.

Result: The result is a conceptual framework aimed at guiding methodological considerations and improving transparency in LLM-based annotations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that treating LLM-based annotation as a measurement process can enhance its reliability and reproducibility, encouraging methodological discussions and future research in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in empirical software engineering (ESE) to automate or assist annotation tasks such as labeling commits, issues, and qualitative artifacts. Yet the reliability and reproducibility of such annotations remain underexplored. Existing studies often lack standardized measures for reliability, calibration, and drift, and frequently omit essential configuration details. We argue that LLM-based annotation should be treated as a measurement process rather than a purely automated activity. In this position paper, we outline the \textbf{Operationalization for LLM-based Annotation Framework (OLAF)}, a conceptual framework that organizes key constructs: \textit{reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation}, and \textit{transparency}. The paper aims to motivate methodological discussion and future empirical work toward more transparent and reproducible LLM-based annotation in software engineering research.

*Yirui He,Yuqi Huai,Xingyu Chen,Joshua Garcia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClassLAR, a lightweight method for recovering Java modules from monolithic systems, outperforming existing techniques in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing large-scale software systems is increasingly difficult, especially due to the inconsistent connection between code-level and architectural abstractions. Modularizing Java projects using JPMS is complex because of ineffective module recovery methods.

Method: ClassLAR uses fully-qualified class names and language models to retrieve semantic information that represents structural and functional intent in Java systems.

Result: ClassLAR demonstrated better performance than existing architecture recovery techniques, achieving up to 10.50 times faster execution and superior architectural-level similarity metrics in tests across 20 Java projects.

Conclusion: ClassLAR offers an efficient and accurate solution for modularizing monolithic Java systems, enhancing architectural consistency with JPMS and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: As an increasing number of software systems reach unprecedented scale, relying solely on code-level abstractions is becoming impractical. While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.

*Xin Wang,Zhenhao Li,Zishuo Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as samplers for multi-objective performance modeling in software systems through the introduction of LLM4Perf. It finds that LLMs outperform traditional approaches and improve baseline performance in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for better sampling strategies to navigate the complex configuration options of software systems, especially addressing the challenges in multi-objective optimization and underutilized semantic information from documentation.

Method: The authors implement a feedback-based framework called LLM4Perf, systematically evaluating LLM-guided sampling in four highly configurable, real-world systems, while analyzing its mechanism through configuration pruning and feedback-driven refinements.

Result: LLM4Perf achieves superior performance in 68.8% of evaluation scenarios, improves baseline methods in 91.5% of cases, and shows the LLM's capability in pruning configuration spaces and adjusting strategies for better results.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that LLMs can be powerful tools in performance engineering, highlighting their ability to outperform traditional methods and providing insights into their success mechanisms.

Abstract: The performance of modern software systems is critically dependent on their complex configuration options. Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.

TL;DR: This study synthesizes insights from 42 studies to identify nine key Apache Kafka design patterns, examining usage trends, domain applications, benchmarking practices, and addressing inconsistencies in reporting and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apache Kafka is widely used for event streaming, but consolidated research on design patterns and benchmarking methodologies remains fragmented.

Method: A structured synthesis of 42 studies (2015-2025) identifies recurring Kafka design patterns and evaluates benchmarking practices, focusing on trends, domain applications, and reproducibility.

Result: Nine recurring Kafka design patterns were identified, co-usage trends and benchmarking practices were analyzed, revealing inconsistencies that limit study comparison and replication.

Conclusion: The research provides a unified taxonomy, benchmark matrix, and heuristics to help architects design reproducible, high-performance, and fault-tolerant Kafka-based systems.

Abstract: Apache Kafka has become a foundational platform for high throughput event streaming, enabling real time analytics, financial transaction processing, industrial telemetry, and large scale data driven systems. Despite its maturity and widespread adoption, consolidated research on reusable architectural design patterns and reproducible benchmarking methodologies remains fragmented across academic and industrial publications. This paper presents a structured synthesis of forty two peer reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, identifying nine recurring Kafka design patterns including log compaction, CQRS bus, exactly once pipelines, change data capture, stream table joins, saga orchestration, tiered storage, multi tenant topics, and event sourcing replay. The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication. By providing a unified taxonomy, pattern benchmark matrix, and actionable decision heuristics, this work offers practical guidance for architects and researchers designing reproducible, high performance, and fault tolerant Kafka based event streaming systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of Large Language Models as judges (LaaJ) in code generation evaluations, focusing on a COBOL use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unreliability of LaaJs, which often miss domain-specific issues, especially in industrial applications like legacy COBOL code modernization.

Method: A taxonomy of LaaJ blind spots is developed, and an analytic checker tool is created to identify domain-specific issues. Analytic hints are dynamically injected into LaaJ prompts to enhance judgment quality.

Result: Experiments reveal that LaaJs alone detect only 45% of errors, but combining LaaJs with the analytic checker's hints boosts detection accuracy to 94%, also improving the explanatory depth.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that hybrid systems combining analytic tools with LaaJs can significantly enhance evaluation accuracy and reliability in industrial code generation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as judges (LaaJ) in code generation pipelines. While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.
  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.
  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts.

*Yibiao Yang,Qingyang Li,Maolin Sun,Jiangchang Wu,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study assesses the Basic (BIC-based) strategy against SBFL techniques for compiler bug localization, revealing Basic's competitive and often superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers rely on identifying bug-inducing commits to debug compilers, but SBFL techniques’ effectiveness compared to such common practices remains unclear.

Method: The Basic strategy pinpoints bug-inducing commits through version history analysis, while SBFL techniques are evaluated on a compiler bug benchmark consisting of 120 cases.

Result: Basic demonstrated comparable or superior performance to SBFL, excelling in Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics for faulty file identification.

Conclusion: Basic is recommended as a benchmarking baseline for future research in compiler fault localization methods.

Abstract: Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios. We recommend that future research adopt Basic as a baseline when developing and evaluating new compiler fault isolation methods.

*Zaheed Ahmed,Philip Makedonski,Jens Grabowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper compares pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in deep learning (DL) to assess realism of artificial faults, finding pre-training mutations more realistic but computationally expensive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore validity of mutation analysis in DL by comparing realism of pre-training vs post-training mutants.

Method: Statistical framework applied to benchmark datasets; analysis of coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults.

Result: Pre-training mutants show higher realism and stronger coupling to real faults than post-training mutants.

Conclusion: Pre-training mutation is more realistic but computationally costly, requiring improved post-training operators for practicality.

Abstract: Mutation analysis is a well-established technique for assessing test quality in the traditional software development paradigm by injecting artificial faults into programs. Its application to deep learning (DL) has expanded beyond classical testing to support tasks such as fault localization, repair, data generation, and model robustness evaluation. The core assumption is that mutants behave similarly to real faults, an assumption well established in traditional software systems but largely unverified for DL.
  This study presents the first empirical comparison of pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in DL with respect to realism. We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches.
  Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism. However, the substantial computational cost of pre-training mutation underscores the need for more effective post-training operators that match or exceed the realism demonstrated by pre-training mutants.

*Aaron Imani,Mohammad Moshirpour,Iftekhar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) use comments in source code for software engineering tasks and analyzes their internal understanding of comment types. The study manipulates comment-related concepts within LLMs to observe significant task-specific and model-specific performance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and influence of source code comments on LLM-driven software engineering tasks, and to examine how comments are represented internally in LLMs.

Method: The study used Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) to analyze LLMs' internal representation of comments, differentiating between comment subtypes. Researchers activated/deactivated these concepts and conducted controlled experiments on ten SE tasks to observe comment-related concept activation.

Result: LLMs internalize comments as distinct concepts and differentiate among comment subtypes (e.g., Javadocs, inline comments). Performance was dependent on task and model, with performance shifts ranging from -90% to +67%. Code summarization tasks activated comment concepts most strongly, while code completion showed the least sensitivity.

Conclusion: LLMs rely significantly on comment concepts in varying degrees depending on the task. This insight calls for the development of SE tools and models that manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on external inputs.

Abstract: While comments are non-functional elements of source code, Large Language Models (LLM) frequently rely on them to perform Software Engineering (SE) tasks. Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input.

TL;DR: Proposes CAFFE, a counterfactual testing framework for fairness in large language models, achieving broader bias detection compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the increasing concern of fairness issues in the growing influence of LLMs.

Method: Introduces CAFFE, a structured fairness testing framework involving test case formalization, automated test data generation, and semantic evaluation.

Result: Experiments on three LLM architectures show CAFFE offers better bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing methods.

Conclusion: CAFFE enhances fairness testing of LLMs by providing a structured, automated, and more reliable approach compared to prior techniques.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational components of modern software systems. As their influence grows, concerns about fairness have become increasingly pressing. Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches.

### [350] [Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891)
*Terrence J. Sejnowski*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of cortical traveling waves and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in supporting long-term working memory and cognitive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how cortical mechanisms, specifically spike timing and traveling waves, contribute to long-term working memory and cognition beyond traditional rate coding.

Method: Analysis and hypothesis linking the temporal precision of cortical traveling waves to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and its potential impact on memory and cognitive processes.

Result: The paper hypothesizes that traveling waves can regulate STDP, strengthening connections over hours, and forming temporary networks to support long-term working memory.

Conclusion: Cortical traveling waves and STDP collectively provide a framework to enhance understanding of cognitive function, suggesting their potential role in complex thought processes.

Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).

Method: A philosophical thought experiment comparing neuronal communication with ideas inspired by historic thought experiments like Molyneux's problem and the Chinese Room.

Result: The conjecture highlights the necessity of bidirectional relationships between the neural network within the brain and the external physical world to process information efficiently.

Conclusion: This thought experiment aims to bridge gaps between ecological psychology and neuroscience frameworks, proposing a broader perspective that includes external interactions for understanding brain efficiency and time processing.

Abstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network of cells, mostly neurons. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest echo to fruitful thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator, or the cogito.

### [352] [Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12767)
*Thiparat Chotibut,Oleg Evnin,Weerawit Horinouchi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper builds an analytic framework to understand trained neuronal network dynamics by analyzing sparse, non-Hermitian Jacobian matrices and their relation to working memory robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify the unexplored link between trained network features and their contribution to favorable dynamical landscapes enabling robust working memory.

Method: The paper investigates Jacobian matrix spectra, proposes a random matrix ensemble based on trained networks, and develops an analytic theory using field theory and supersymmetry techniques.

Result: The spectral properties of trained Jacobian matrices, such as sparsity and weight distribution, are linked to network dynamics critical for robust computation.

Conclusion: The analytic framework connects network parameters (e.g., sparsity, E/I ratio, timescales, gains) to near-critical dynamics essential for improved working memory performance.

Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.

*Sophia Seulkee Kang,François-Xavier Briol,Toni Karvonen,Zonghao Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces BayesSum, a novel estimator for estimating expectations over discrete domains, which is more efficient than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing estimators, such as Monte Carlo, in approximating expectations over discrete domains.

Method: BayesSum leverages Bayesian quadrature concepts and Gaussian processes to incorporate prior information about the integrand for better performance.

Result: BayesSum demonstrates faster convergence theoretically and requires fewer samples empirically for tasks such as parameter estimation in specific models.

Conclusion: BayesSum is a sample-efficient alternative to traditional estimators, suitable for a range of challenging computational problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging computational problem of estimating intractable expectations over discrete domains. Existing approaches, including Monte Carlo and Russian Roulette estimators, are consistent but often require a large number of samples to achieve accurate results. We propose a novel estimator, \emph{BayesSum}, which is an extension of Bayesian quadrature to discrete domains. It is more sample efficient than alternatives due to its ability to make use of prior information about the integrand through a Gaussian process. We show this through theory, deriving a convergence rate significantly faster than Monte Carlo in a broad range of settings. We also demonstrate empirically that our proposed method does indeed require fewer samples on several synthetic settings as well as for parameter estimation for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and Potts models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for network structure learning struggle with zero-inflated count data and runtime efficiency for larger variable sets.

Method: ZICO formulates each network node as a zero-inflated generalized linear model, optimizing a smooth score-based objective while enforcing acyclicity using a differentiable constraint and sparsity regularization.

Result: ZICO demonstrates superior performance and faster runtimes on simulated datasets, while outperforming or matching algorithms in reverse engineering gene regulatory networks. It scales effectively for large variable sets.

Conclusion: ZICO provides a scalable and effective approach for network structure learning across diverse domains, making it a robust tool in handling zero-inflated count data.

Abstract: We address network structure learning from zero-inflated count data by casting each node as a zero-inflated generalized linear model and optimizing a smooth, score-based objective under a directed acyclic graph constraint. Our Zero-Inflated Continuous Optimization (ZICO) approach uses node-wise likelihoods with canonical links and enforces acyclicity through a differentiable surrogate constraint combined with sparsity regularization. ZICO achieves superior performance with faster runtimes on simulated data. It also performs comparably to or better than common algorithms for reverse engineering gene regulatory networks. ZICO is fully vectorized and mini-batched, enabling learning on larger variable sets with practical runtimes in a wide range of domains.

### [355] [Advantages and limitations in the use of transfer learning for individual treatment effects in causal machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16489)
*Seyda Betul Aydin,Holger Brandt*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores improving individual treatment effects (ITE) estimation in small sample sizes using transfer learning (TL-TARNet) added to TARNet models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of generalizing causal knowledge across varying contexts, particularly improving model-based estimators for smaller datasets such as those in behavioral sciences.

Method: The authors propose TL-TARNet, a transfer learning approach, and conduct simulations with different source/target sample sizes, testing both randomized and non-randomized settings. They also apply their model empirically using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II).

Result: TL-TARNet outperforms standard TARNet, reduces ITE error, and improves bias reduction, especially for small target samples when large, unbiased source datasets are available.

Conclusion: Transfer learning can enhance causal model estimations of ITEs, making them more applicable and accurate for small datasets.

Abstract: Generalizing causal knowledge across diverse environments is challenging, especially when estimates from large-scale datasets must be applied to smaller or systematically different contexts, where external validity is critical. Model-based estimators of individual treatment effects (ITE) from machine learning require large sample sizes, limiting their applicability in domains such as behavioral sciences with smaller datasets. We demonstrate how estimation of ITEs with Treatment Agnostic Representation Networks (TARNet; Shalit et al., 2017) can be improved by leveraging knowledge from source datasets and adapting it to new settings via transfer learning (TL-TARNet; Aloui et al., 2023). In simulations that vary source and sample sizes and consider both randomized and non-randomized intervention target settings, the transfer-learning extension TL-TARNet improves upon standard TARNet, reducing ITE error and attenuating bias when a large unbiased source is available and target samples are small. In an empirical application using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), we estimate the effect of mothers' firewood collection time on children's weekly study time; transfer learning pulls the target mean ITEs toward the source ITE estimate, reducing bias in the estimates obtained without transfer. These results suggest that transfer learning for causal models can improve the estimation of ITE in small samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of simulating equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials (amorphous materials) is extremely slow and challenging due to their disordered nature and lack of atomic periodicity.

Method: The proposed approach leverages an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework. It combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching, incorporating periodic boundary conditions and system symmetries using an adapted equivariant graph neural network.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance for amorphous material systems by enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints.

Conclusion: The incorporated geometric and symmetry constraints are critical to enhancing the performance of generative models for sampling amorphous material systems, presenting a promising approach for this longstanding challenge.

Abstract: Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.

TL;DR: The study explores biases in empirical flow matching (FM), showing energetic suboptimality and analyzing sample kinetic energy influenced by source distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding biases and structural implications within FM samplers that affect their alignment with optimal transport.

Method: Study empirical flow matching mechanics, analyze kinetic energy behaviors in generated samples using varying source distributions.

Result: Empirical FM results in non-gradient fields and energetic suboptimality, with kinetic energy behaviors exhibiting exponential or polynomial tails influenced by source distributions.

Conclusion: Empirical FM shows intrinsic biases influenced by source distributions, impacting structural and energetic optimization.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is almost never a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically energetically suboptimal. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of heuristic methods for solving the TSP by leveraging topological divergence analysis.

Method: Developing a canonical decomposition theorem for the tour-MST gap using RTD-Lite barcode and integrating this guidance into 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics.

Result: Experiments show that topological guidance leads to improved performance and faster convergence in TSP optimization across different datasets.

Conclusion: Topological methods can effectively guide heuristic optimizations for TSP, offering potential advancements in computational efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We introduce a topological feedback mechanism for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by analyzing the divergence between a tour and the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our key contribution is a canonical decomposition theorem that expresses the tour-MST gap as edge-wise topology-divergence gaps from the RTD-Lite barcode. Based on this, we develop a topological guidance for 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics that increases their performance. We carry out experiments with fine-optimization of tours obtained from heatmap-based methods, TSPLIB, and random instances. Experiments demonstrate the topology-guided optimization results in better performance and faster convergence in many cases.

### [359] [Hierarchical Neural Surfaces for 3D Mesh Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15985)
*Sai Karthikey Pentapati,Gregoire Phillips,Alan Bovik*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to build compact Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for 3D meshes, focusing on accurately encoding and decoding zero-genus 3D manifolds using spherical parameterization and displacement vector fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to develop neural counterparts for triangle mesh-based geometry representations, which are the most widely used in the industry, while most existing studies focus on other implicit representations of 3D geometries.

Method: The method involves creating a spherical parameterization of a given 3D mesh and constructing an INR to encode the displacement vector field, allowing for regeneration of the original shape with a hierarchical structure for compactness.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between reconstruction quality and compressed representation size. It enables real-time decoding of 3D meshes with arbitrary resolution and connectivity.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates an effective approach to building INRs for triangle mesh-based 3D geometries, providing compact, high-quality reconstructions that are both efficient and versatile for 3D applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art compression of a broad range of modalities such as images, videos, 3D surfaces, and audio. Most studies have focused on building neural counterparts of traditional implicit representations of 3D geometries, such as signed distance functions. However, the triangle mesh-based representation of geometry remains the most widely used representation in the industry, while building INRs capable of generating them has been sparsely studied. In this paper, we present a method for building compact INRs of zero-genus 3D manifolds. Our method relies on creating a spherical parameterization of a given 3D mesh - mapping the surface of a mesh to that of a unit sphere - then constructing an INR that encodes the displacement vector field defined continuously on its surface that regenerates the original shape. The compactness of our representation can be attributed to its hierarchical structure, wherein it first recovers the coarse structure of the encoded surface before adding high-frequency details to it. Once the INR is computed, 3D meshes of arbitrary resolution/connectivity can be decoded from it. The decoding can be performed in real time while achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between reconstruction quality and the size of the compressed representations.

TL;DR: The study introduces IPNet, a neuromorphic architecture with human-like working memory, using Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) for energy-efficient memory and decision-making, outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a neuromorphic architecture mimicking human working memory capabilities while overcoming the energy costs and noise sensitivity of existing artificial networks.

Method: IPNet leverages intrinsic neuronal plasticity and Joule-heating dynamics of MTJs to emulate biological memory volatility. Hardware-in-the-loop validation and various benchmark tests were conducted.

Result: IPNet achieved high accuracy (99.65%) on DVS gesture datasets, reduced steering prediction error in autonomous driving, and demonstrated massive energy efficiency over competing architectures.

Conclusion: IPNet's implementation of human-like working memory improves dynamic vision processing, reduces energy costs, and validates a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm with scalable hardware design.

Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system to detect lead (Pb) contamination in urban soils using signal propagation differences caused by salts in the soil.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a cost-effective, less labor-intensive method for detecting urban soil contamination by lead (Pb) and promoting public health, food safety, and urban greening.

Method: The approach involves studying the behavior of signal propagation differences caused by salts (e.g., NaCl and Pb(NO3)2) in the soil, leveraging radio frequency signals and machine learning models to classify lead contamination levels.

Result: The SoilScanner system classifies soils into low-Pb and high-Pb categories with 72% accuracy, correctly identifying no samples with more than 500 ppm as low-Pb.

Conclusion: SoilScanner demonstrates a promising, feasible, and cost-efficient way to develop portable and affordable devices for lead detection in soils based on wireless technology.

Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dispersed investor beliefs are compressed into asset prices and improve predictions of long-horizon risk premiums using an interpretable framework.

Method: Developed CB-APM, a neural network that captures consensus formation processes to model belief aggregation and predict future returns.

Result: CB-APM improves prediction accuracy, outperforms traditional models, provides interpretable components, and captures belief-driven structures in expected returns.

Conclusion: CB-APM offers a useful and interpretable framework that links belief aggregation to asset pricing, achieving meaningful prediction and explanatory benefits.

Abstract: We introduce the \textit{Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model} (CB-APM), a partially interpretable neural network that replicates the reasoning processes of sell-side analysts by capturing how dispersed investor beliefs are compressed into asset prices through a consensus formation process. By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ev-Trust, a trust mechanism based on evolutionary game theory, to improve agent collaboration and exclude malicious participants in LLM-driven decentralized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation caused by LLM-based multi-agent systems in decentralized interactions.

Method: Ev-Trust combines direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue in a dynamic feedback structure, employing replicator dynamics within a decentralized service framework to guide agents' strategy evolution.

Result: Theoretical derivations confirm equilibrium stability, and experiments demonstrate reduced malicious behavior, enhanced collaboration, and increased collective revenue.

Conclusion: Ev-Trust effectively fosters trustworthiness and collaboration in agent-centric environments, offering a new approach to trust modeling in decentralized systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper identifies an improved statistic for substitution in two-stage stochastic optimization, improving decision-making accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias caused by using the mean of a random distribution, which leads to suboptimal decisions in service system design.

Method: The paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decision-corrected point estimate and develops an algorithm for calculating it. It also explores the relationship under a decomposable network structure with the newsvendor solution.

Result: The decision-corrected point estimate outperforms the traditional fluid approximation in numerical experiments, improving decision effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed decision-focused correction method provides a superior alternative to traditional fluid approximations, enhancing optimization in service systems.

Abstract: Fluid approximation is a widely used approach for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems, with broad applications in service system design such as call centers and healthcare operations. However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation.

Motivation: The paper addresses the pressing 21st-century issues of energy and pollution, emphasizing the need for improvements in the power grid system through smart grids.

Method: The authors adopt a complex system approach combining game-theoretical and classical methods to model smart grids, focusing on achieving global optimization.

Result: The approach offers flexibility and scalability in optimizing smart grids while maintaining general applicability.

Conclusion: Modeling smart grids with the proposed hybrid optimization approach can overcome real-world constraints and provide scalable solutions.

Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.

*Ningwei Bai,Chi Pui Chan,Qichen Yin,Tengyang Gong,Yunda Yan,Zezhi Tang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid control approach combining RL, ESO, and ETM to achieve efficient and disturbance-tolerant performance with minimal computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a control architecture that addresses disturbance rejection and reduces computation loads while retaining strong performance.

Method: Integrates Reinforcement Learning-based control with Extended State Observer (ESO) and Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to optimize disturbance compensation and computational efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates superior control performance and disturbance rejection with reduced sampling and computational effort compared to traditional time-triggered methods.

Conclusion: The proposed control framework is effective in achieving stable, efficient, and disturbance-resilient operation in closed-loop systems.

Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.

*Yin Liu,Qiming Dai,Junyu Zhang,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper enhances theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm, analyzing its behavior under various KL regularizations and providing convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of RLHF and actor-only PPO algorithms, their theoretical properties—especially with regularization via KL-divergence—remain underexplored.

Method: The paper examines PPO-Clip in a deterministic RL setting with softmax policy parameterization and employs mathematical tools like Lipschitz smoothness and Łojasiewicz inequalities.

Result: Non-uniform Lipschitz conditions and a Łojasiewicz inequality are derived, enabling proofs of global linear convergence (forward KL-regularizer) and local convergence (reverse KL-regularizer).

Conclusion: The study provides rigorous convergence guarantees, strengthening the theoretical understanding of PPO-Clip in RLHF settings with robust regularization mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.

### [370] [Muon is Provably Faster with Momentum Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16598)
*Xun Qian,Hussein Rammal,Dmitry Kovalev,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Deep learning optimizers using momentum variance reduction (MVR) are proposed to enhance performance, offering faster convergence rates in specific tasks, especially over existing methods for training large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance and convergence rate of deep learning optimizers, especially those used in large language model training, by building on advancements like Muon and Scion optimizers.

Method: The authors integrate momentum variance reduction (MVR) into the generalized Gluon framework, which encompasses methods like Muon and Scion, and propose three MVR-based non-convex optimization approaches achieving faster rates of convergence.

Result: The proposed MVR-Gluon approaches show an improved convergence rate, moving from ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$. Numerical experiments validate better iteration complexity and effectiveness compared to existing optimizers.

Conclusion: Incorporating MVR improves the performance of Non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizers, demonstrating theoretical and experimental superiority in training large language models.

Abstract: Recent empirical research has demonstrated that deep learning optimizers based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO) over specifically chosen Non-Euclidean norm balls, such as Muon and Scion, outperform Adam-type methods in the training of large language models. In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$. Additionally, we provide improved rates in the star-convex case. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments that verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of iteration complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-generated content videos exhibit high variability, making the application of machine learning algorithms for video encoding optimization challenging.

Method: The proposed Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework consists of (1) adaptive regulation of preprocessing intensity, (2) adaptive quantization levels for codec simulation, and (3) adaptive lambda tradeoff for rate-distortion loss adjustment.

Result: Experimental results on large-scale test sets show that the method achieves exceptional performance.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances encoding optimization for UGC videos, addressing challenges posed by their variability and diverse characteristics.

Abstract: In recent years, user generated content (UGC) has become the dominant force in internet traffic. However, UGC videos exhibit a higher degree of variability and diverse characteristics compared to traditional encoding test videos. This variance challenges the effectiveness of data-driven machine learning algorithms for optimizing encoding in the broader context of UGC scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity. Secondly, an adaptive quantization level is employed to fine-tune the codec simulator. Thirdly, we utilize an adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust the rate-distortion loss function. Experimental results on large-scale test sets demonstrate that our method attains exceptional performance.

### [372] [Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109)
*Zhuoran Li,Zhen Gao,Xinhua Liu,Zheng Wang,Xiaotian Zhou,Lei Liu,Yongpeng Wu,Wei Feng,Yongming Huang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper highlights the role of large AI models in transforming base stations into intelligent agents for 6G, emphasizing their application in safety-critical scenarios and challenges in implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of perception, communication, and computation is key for 6G systems. Large AI models can empower base stations with intelligence to address these complex demands.

Method: The paper discusses the evolution of base station architecture, proposes an intelligent base station agent (IBSA) pipeline, explores use cases like autonomous driving and UAV monitoring, and examines enabling technologies and evaluation frameworks.

Result: The study outlines effective architectures, technologies, and their applications while proposing a holistic evaluation framework for IBSA performance in 6G.

Conclusion: LAM-enabled IBSAs provide a feasible direction for creating 6G systems inherent to perception, communication, and computation, yet several challenges like trust, adaptation, and standardization remain.

Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.

*Matteo Fasulo,Giusy Spacone,Thorir Mar Ingolfsson,Yawei Li,Luca Benini,Andrea Cossettini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces TinyMyo, a lightweight Transformer-based foundation model for surface EMG signals, capable of generalizing to multiple tasks with state-of-the-art performance and deployed on an ultra-low-power microcontroller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread use of surface EMG in various fields, robust generalization across subjects, devices, and protocols remains challenging. Foundation models for EMG are emerging but lack versatility and deployability on embedded platforms.

Method: The authors designed TinyMyo, a Transformer encoder-based model pre-trained using self-supervised learning on public EMG datasets. The model uses a lightweight architecture with 3.6M parameters and supports multiple downstream tasks by adapting task-specific heads.

Result: TinyMyo achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets (NinaPro DB5, UCI-EMG, EPN-612) and is deployable on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9) with an average power consumption of 36.45mW.

Conclusion: TinyMyo offers a robust and efficient EMG foundation model with significant potential for advancing cross-domain applications in EMG processing. Open-sourcing the model encourages broader adoption and further research within the EMG community.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\pm0.16\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\pm0.32\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\pm0.09\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (https://github.com/pulp-bio/BioFoundation), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel criterion, concurrence, for detecting dependence between signals using a classifier to distinguish aligned and misaligned segments, enabling analysis of non-linear interactions without prior knowledge or large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems often exhibit complex, non-linear interactions that current methods fail to capture without extensive data or pre-existing knowledge, limiting scientific discovery.

Method: The authors propose the concept of concurrence, identifying dependence between time-series by constructing classifiers that distinguish temporally aligned from misaligned data segments.

Result: The concurrence approach is theoretically linked to dependence and effective across diverse signals, such as fMRI or behavioral data, without needing large datasets or parameter adjustments.

Conclusion: Concurrence is a versatile and promising method for detecting relationships in a variety of complex systems, potentially improving analysis across scientific disciplines.

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge or large datasets. We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data.

*Chenyu Zhu,Zeyang Li,Ziyi Xie,Jie Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for specific emitter identification (SEI) that achieves 96% accuracy using minimal data and without requiring prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SEI methods rely heavily on large datasets or prior information, which makes them impractical in scenarios with limited labeled data. This study aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce a complex variational mode decomposition algorithm to reconstruct signals for better feature extraction. A temporal convolutional network models sequential characteristics, while a spatial attention mechanism focuses on informative segments. A branch network reduces the need for extensive auxiliary datasets by leveraging pre-trained weights.

Result: The method demonstrated effectiveness through ablation experiments and achieved 96% identification accuracy using only 10 symbols on a public dataset without any prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances SEI performance under limited data conditions and eliminates the dependency on prior information, providing a practical and accurate solution.

Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) utilizes passive hardware characteristics to authenticate transmitters, providing a robust physical-layer security solution. However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model. An accuracy comparison on a public dataset reveals that our method achieves 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without requiring any prior knowledge.

*Sharif Al Mamun,Rakib Hossain,Md. Jobayer Rahman,Malay Kumar Devnath,Farhana Afroz,Lisan Al Amin*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework improves financial risk management via models like DLM for VaR, Bayesian logistic regression for fraud detection, and Beta state-space model for compliance, providing interpretability and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in financial contexts like market volatility, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring is underdeveloped and critical for actionable insights.

Method: The framework employs Bayesian models like discount-factor DLM for VaR, logistic regression for fraud detection, and hierarchical Beta state-space for compliance, emphasizing interpretability and GPU-accelerated computations.

Result: Models were evaluated on S&P 500 data and fraud datasets from 2000-2024, outperforming benchmarks (e.g., GARCH, LSTM) with improved calibration and better recall/AUC-ROC for fraud detection.

Conclusion: The Bayesian analytics framework achieves precise risk insights but faces challenges like sparse fraud data. Future work will refine the approach with extended priors and feature sets.

Abstract: A Bayesian analytics framework that precisely quantifies uncertainty offers a significant advance for financial risk management. We develop an integrated approach that consistently enhances the handling of risk in market volatility forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. Our probabilistic, interpretable models deliver reliable results: We evaluate the performance of one-day-ahead 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts on daily S&P 500 returns, with a training period from 2000 to 2019 and an out-of-sample test period spanning 2020 to 2024. Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup. Remaining challenges include sparse fraud data and proxy compliance labels, but the framework enables actionable risk insights. Future expansion will extend feature sets, explore regime-switching priors, and enhance scalable inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating automatic data product creation and enhance the process of enabling end users to derive insights efficiently.

Result: DP-Bench emerges as the first benchmark tailored to automatic data product creation, demonstrating its potential in serving as a standard evaluation framework.

Conclusion: DP-Bench provides a novel foundation for assessing automatic data product generation, aiding industry adoption and advancement in this domain.

Abstract: A data product is created with the intention of solving a specific problem, addressing a specific business usecase or meeting a particular need, going beyond just serving data as a raw asset. Data products enable end users to gain greater insights about their data. Since it was first introduced over a decade ago, there has been considerable work, especially in industry, to create data products manually or semi-automatically. However, there exists hardly any benchmark to evaluate automatic data product creation. In this work, we present a benchmark, first of its kind, for this task. We call it DP-Bench. We describe how this benchmark was created by taking advantage of existing work in ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) and Text-to-SQL benchmarks. We also propose a number of LLM based approaches that can be considered as baselines for generating data products automatically.

### [381] [Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083)
*Thanh Dat Hoang,Thanh Tam Nguyen,Thanh Trung Huynh,Hongzhi Yin,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in modern Text2SQL systems handling large real-world schemas and introduces a framework, \toolname, for efficient schema filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text2SQL systems struggle with large schemas that exceed the context limits of LLMs, exemplified by real-world datasets like Spider 2.0.

Method: \toolname ranks columns using an LLM encoder, reranks them with a graph transformer, and selects sub-schemas through a Steiner-tree heuristic.

Result: Experiments demonstrate \toolname achieving high recall, precision, fast performance, and scalability to schemas with over 23,000 columns.

Conclusion: \toolname effectively scales Text2SQL systems to handle large schemas, outperforming existing methods in precision and recall while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModelTables, a benchmark for structured data specifically capturing AI model-related tables which are underrepresented in traditional text retrieval systems. It includes 60K+ models and 90K+ tables and explores table search methods with varying retrieval performance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of structured semantics for performance and configuration tables linked to AI models, providing better tools for retrieving and understanding model interrelationships.

Method: Researchers built a standardized corpus by extracting and linking tables from sources like Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, utilizing multi-source ground truth signals (citations, model card links, shared datasets) to evaluate table search techniques.

Result: Their analysis shows the strengths and weaknesses of union, dense retrieval, and hybrid retrieval methods, with the dense retrieval achieving the highest P@1 performance (66.5%), highlighting the opportunity for optimization in semantic table searches.

Conclusion: By releasing ModelTables, the study delivers the first large structured dataset focusing on AI model tables. This work pushes the development of better structured data retrieval, comparison techniques, and organization for AI model-related knowledge.

Abstract: We present ModelTables, a benchmark of tables in Model Lakes that captures the structured semantics of performance and configuration tables often overlooked by text only retrieval. The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods.

*Stefan Dvoretskii,Anwai Archit,Constantin Pape,Josh Moore,Marco Nolden*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BioimageAIpub, a workflow for converting bioimaging data for easier use in machine learning platforms like HuggingFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate researchers' struggle with data wrangling and make bioimaging datasets more accessible for analysis and machine learning.

Method: The paper proposes a workflow that simplifies data conversion, making bioimaging datasets compatible with HuggingFace.

Result: BioimageAIpub enables seamless upload and sharing of bioimaging data on HuggingFace, promoting easier accessibility and usability.

Conclusion: The workflow significantly reduces the effort required for data preparation, helping researchers focus on developing bioimage analysis tools.

Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.

*Lena Giebeler,Deepa Krishnaswamy,David Clunie,Jakob Wasserthal,Lalith Kumar Shiyam Sundar,Andres Diaz-Pinto,Klaus H. Maier-Hein,Murong Xu,Bjoern Menze,Steve Pieper,Ron Kikinis,Andrey Fedorov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to evaluate anatomy segmentation models when ground truth annotations are absent. It includes harmonized representations, interactive visualizations, and a case study on CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for practical tools to evaluate segmentation models on datasets that lack ground truth, as the number of AI-based anatomy segmentation models increases.

Method: The approach involves harmonizing segmentation outputs, consistent terminology-based labeling, and extending 3D Slicer for comparison and interactive results visualization. A case study on six models applied to NLST dataset CT scans is also included.

Result: The framework simplifies model comparisons, enabling automatic loading and structure-wise assessments. It highlights model strengths and weaknesses, showing good model agreement on some structures but issues in others, like invalid rib segmentations.

Conclusion: The resources provided (e.g., harmonization scripts, visualization tools) aid in model evaluation without ground truth, supporting better model selection and usage decisions.

Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from https://imagingdatacommons.github.io/segmentation-comparison/ including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.

*Jin Young Kim,Jeremy Hudson,Jeongchul Kim,Qing Lyu,Christopher T. Whitlow*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study proposes MCR-VQGAN to synthesize tau PET images from MRI scans, addressing challenges in tau PET imaging for Alzheimer's diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of tau PET imaging in Alzheimer’s disease diagnostic workflows, including cost, radiation exposure, availability, and clinical workload.

Method: Developed MCR-VQGAN with multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and CBAM, trained on paired MRI and tau PET scans, and evaluated against other image synthesis models.

Result: MCR-VQGAN achieved superior image synthesis metrics (MSE, PSNR, SSIM) and preserved clinically relevant diagnostic features for Alzheimer's disease classification.

Conclusion: MCR-VQGAN can serve as a scalable alternative to tau PET imaging, enabling improved accessibility for Alzheimer’s research and diagnosis.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.

### [386] [Low-Latency FPGA Control System for Real-Time Neural Network Processing in CCD-Based Trapped-Ion Qubit Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15838)
*Binglei Lou,Gautham Duddi Krishnaswaroop,Filip Wojcicki,Ruilin Wu,Richard Rademacher,Zhiqiang Que,Wayne Luk,Philip H. W. Leong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks deep neural networks (DNNs) for qubit detection latency on FPGAs and GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in speed and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trapped-ion quantum computing requires precise and fast qubit state measurement. Existing methods lack detailed exploration of DNN latency performance on specific hardware.

Method: The authors benchmarked DNNs (MLP and Vision Transformer) for qubit state detection on FPGAs and GPUs, comparing inference latency and fidelity metrics. Hardware configurations were described, with focus on FPGA integration and GPU baselines.

Result: DNNs significantly reduced measurement fidelity error compared to thresholding, with FPGA implementations achieving nanosecond-scale latency and 100x faster single-shot measurement compared to GPUs.

Conclusion: FPGA-based DNNs outperform GPUs in latency and fidelity for qubit detection. Interface optimization, particularly EMCCD transmission, could further improve performance, shaping next-gen qubit detection systems.

Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.

### [387] [Non-Linear Strong Data-Processing for Quantum Hockey-Stick Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16778)
*Theshani Nuradha,Ian George,Christoph Hirche*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses non-linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI) for quantum hockey-stick divergence under certain noise conditions, improving upon linear SDPI and classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear SDPI for quantum divergence are not tight and can often be improved for better results.

Method: The authors establish non-linear SDPI using $F_γ$ curves, generalizing Dobrushin curves to quantum settings, alongside reverse-Pinsker type inequalities and analysis of sequential channel compositions.

Result: Improved non-linear SDPI allow for tighter finite mixing times and stronger privacy guarantees in quantum local differential privacy scenarios.

Conclusion: Non-linear SDPI enhance the effectiveness of quantum state distinguishability metrics and privacy measures beyond the scope of linear approaches.

Abstract: Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_γ$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze multimodal X-ray images of particulate composites, transforming them into graphs to gain physical insights and guide material design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing large-scale, complex multimodal X-ray images in particulate composites, enabling microstructure optimization and physical understanding.

Method: Employment of a machine learning framework to convert experimental X-ray images into topology-aware graphs, leading to the analysis of microstructural features and their roles.

Result: Demonstration of the framework on lithium battery cathodes, validating the importance of triple phase junctions and dual conductive pathways for electrochemical performance.

Conclusion: This graph-based representation bridges experimental imaging and functional understanding, providing a scalable tool for data-driven material design across particulate composites.

Abstract: Particulate composites underpin many solid-state chemical and electrochemical systems, where microstructural features such as multiphase boundaries and inter-particle connections strongly influence system performance. Advances in X-ray microscopy enable capturing large-scale, multimodal images of these complex microstructures with an unprecedentedly high throughput. However, harnessing these datasets to discover new physical insights and guide microstructure optimization remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a machine learning (ML) enabled framework that enables automated transformation of experimental multimodal X-ray images of multiphase particulate composites into scalable, topology-aware graphs for extracting physical insights and establishing local microstructure-property relationships at both the particle and network level. Using the multiphase particulate cathode of solid-state lithium batteries as an example, our ML-enabled graph analysis corroborates the critical role of triple phase junctions and concurrent ion/electron conduction channels in realizing desirable local electrochemical activity. Our work establishes graph-based microstructure representation as a powerful paradigm for bridging multimodal experimental imaging and functional understanding, and facilitating microstructure-aware data-driven materials design in a broad range of particulate composites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synthesis via innovative catalyst design for nanoscale reactions.

Method: A holistic framework combining machine learning with traditional catalyst design is proposed. It includes electronic structure databases, NLP-based embedding models, and physical predictive models.

Result: 54 catalyst candidates were screened; three were identified as promising, with experimental validation showing FeTiO3 achieving a semiconducting selectivity of 98.6%.

Conclusion: The framework advances global catalyst design by integrating ML and scientific insights, achieving precise control in semiconducting CNT synthesis and offering generalizable methodology for nanomaterials synthesis.

Abstract: Catalyst design is crucial for materials synthesis, especially for complex reaction networks. Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.

TL;DR: This paper optimizes Copper nanoparticle synthesis using a small dataset for machine learning predictions, achieving superior accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility and size control in Cu NP synthesis are critical but challenging due to sensitivity to reaction parameters and high experimental optimization costs.

Method: Machine learning is applied using a small dataset of 25 synthesis experiments, leveraging Latin Hypercube Sampling and interpretable ensemble regression models.

Result: By achieving an $R^2$ value of 0.74 with ensemble models, ML predictions significantly outperformed classical statistical methods that yielded an $R^2$ of 0.60.

Conclusion: High-quality, small datasets combined with interpretable ML models can efficiently optimize lab-scale inorganic synthesis, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction. This approach provides a sustainable and experimentally realistic pathway toward data-driven inorganic synthesis design.

*Luuk H. E. Kempen,Raffaele Cheula,Mie Andersen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of 80 machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for tasks typical in heterogeneous catalysis, highlighting strengths and their limitations, such as failures with magnetic materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in MLIP benchmarks, which mainly focus on ordered, crystalline, and bulk materials, and do not sufficiently reflect real-world applications like heterogeneous catalysis.

Method: A systematic zero-shot performance analysis on 80 MLIPs was conducted, using tasks relevant to heterogeneous catalysis across various datasets (e.g., adsorption and reactions on surfaces, and energy evaluations for metal oxides).

Result: The study finds that foundational MLIPs already achieve high accuracy in specific applications (e.g., vacancy formation energies in oxides). However, challenges such as poor performance on magnetic materials and increased error during structure relaxation are noted.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that foundational MLIPs are not universally optimal, emphasizing the need for careful selection and benchmarking of suitable MLIPs for specific applications.

Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.

*Manuel Bentele,Onur Altinordu,Jan Körner,Andreas Podelski,Axel Sikora*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for continuously checking Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) specifications during the iterative development of embedded applications, showcasing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In industrial settings, the unpredictability of software model checking when testing HAL interface specifications hinders its adoption, despite its potential to prevent serious issues like crashes or hardware damage.

Method: The authors propose an iterative development process where HAL interface specifications are checked in every step. By starting with a basic program skeleton and adding functionality incrementally, the specific feature of model checking — its ability to carry over computed abstractions between steps — is exploited.

Result: Preliminary experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed method enables successful HAL specification checks during every development iteration, including the final application.

Conclusion: The novel approach demonstrated potential to reduce the unpredictability of HAL interface specification checks, making it more viable for industrial use and ensuring reliable embedded application development.

Abstract: The correct use of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface in embedded applications is crucial to prevent malfunctions, crashes, or even hardware damage. Software model checking has been successfully applied to check interface specifications in application programs, but its employment in industrial practice is hindered by its unpredictability (whether it succeeds for a given application program or not). In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this problem by checking the HAL interface specification continuously and right from the start of the development. I.e., we develop an embedded application in several iterations without a formal connection between the steps. The steps start from a program skeleton which does nothing but calling HAL functions. Actual functionality is added consecutively. The HAL interface specification is checked in each step of the sequence. The idea of the approach is to exploit a specific feature of software model checking: Its attempt to compute exactly the abstraction that is needed for the check to succeed may carry over from one step to the next, even if there is no formal connection between the steps. The experience from a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach in the development of embedded applications is very promising. Following our approach, the check succeeds in each step and in particular in the final application program.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbols as counterparts to Wigner symbols, enabling structured Cartesian-based architectures for atomistic ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spherical tensor constructions are solely viable for atomistic machine learning and to explore Cartesian tensor-based approaches as alternatives.

Method: Developed Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbols for ICT operations, extended e3nn, released Python package cartnn, and implemented Cartesian versions of existing models for systematic comparisons.

Result: The study facilitates assessment of Cartesian-based architectures by releasing comparison implementations and highlights conceptual validity in Cartesian space for certain models.

Conclusion: Irreducible Cartesian tensor-based architectures show promise in machine learning, motivating further exploration of these approaches to complement spherical tensor dominance.

Abstract: Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework connecting cosmology, physics, biology, cognition, and AI as interlinked dynamical systems through their evolving states in the universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cross-disciplinary narrative that seamlessly connects domains of science through dynamical processes and recurring mathematical motifs.

Method: The authors study how evolutionary dynamics and phase transitions shape universal structures, interpreting phenomena like life, cognition, and machine learning through dynamical systems principles.

Result: The paper outlines recurring patterns across scientific domains, presenting biological and artificial systems as capable of perturbing their evolutionary trajectories.

Conclusion: Instead of introducing new models, this paper provides a broader theoretical perspective on understanding the universe's history and the dynamics shaping its complex evolution.

Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.

Motivation: To address limitations in current UI optimization models that overlook Cross-Responsiveness and reduce interaction efficiency.

Method: Uses FECSM for CR assessment and QNDSOA for optimization, supported by advanced classification models like BiGLMRU.

Result: Achieved an average fitness rate of 98.5632% in optimizing UI designs.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently enhances web UI design, incorporating advanced techniques for impactful user experience improvements.

Abstract: User Interface (UI) optimization is essential in the digital era to enhance user satisfaction in web environments. Nevertheless, the existing UI optimization models had overlooked the Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, affecting the user interaction efficiency. Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.

Result: CoTI achieved comparable or better thematic analysis than junior investigators and baseline NLP models and was implemented into a user-facing application for human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: CoTI demonstrates promise in automating thematic analysis, though junior investigators' reliance on AI may affect their critical thinking.

Abstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.

### [398] [Evaluation of Generative Models for Emotional 3D Animation Generation in VR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16081)
*Kiran Chhatre,Renan Guarese,Andrii Matviienko,Christopher Peters*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates emotional 3D animation generative models within VR, focusing on user-centered metrics like realism, naturalness, and interaction quality to assess emotional animations from speech-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of user-centric evaluations in generative models for nonverbal emotional animation, aiming to improve their alignment with perceived emotions.

Method: Three state-of-the-art speech-driven 3D animation models were evaluated in VR through a user study (N=48) assessing emotions (happiness and neutral). Real expressions were used for comparison.

Result: Explicit emotion modeling resulted in higher recognition accuracy compared to purely speech-driven synchronization. Generative models performed poorly in subtle emotional states and facial expression realism, but were rated diverse.

Conclusion: Current models handle high-arousal emotions better but struggle with subtle expressions and overall interaction quality, emphasizing the need for more advanced, user-driven evaluations to refine their performance.

Abstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.

### [399] [Plausibility as Failure: How LLMs and Humans Co-Construct Epistemic Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16750)
*Claudia Vale Oliveira,Nelson Zagalo,Filipe Silva,Anabela Brandao,Syeda Faryal Hussain Khurrum,Joaquim Santos*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates how the errors of large language models (LLMs) are interpreted by humans, focusing on how plausibility and human judgment contribute to misunderstanding and miscalibration during human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLM errors affect human reasoning and judgment during human-AI interactions, particularly how interpretive failures arise and are shaped by both model and human contributions.

Method: A three-round, multi-LLM evaluation featuring interdisciplinary tasks and assessment frameworks was conducted to study evaluator interpretations of LLM responses across various dimensions, including linguistic, epistemic, and credibility aspects.

Result: Errors in LLMs transitioned from predictive to interpretive, with plausible and coherent outputs masking deeper inaccuracies. Evaluators relied on surface cues such as fluency and coherence, often conflating multiple criteria and allowing erroneous answers to pass as credible.

Conclusion: LLM errors are co-constructed through model behavior and human shortcuts, suggesting the need for evaluation frameworks that address this relational dynamic. This has implications for LLM assessment, fostering digital literacy, and improving human-AI interaction design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.

Conclusion: The presented method showcases significant advancements in experiment design for ML-driven science, optimizing how molecule activity is analyzed.

Abstract: One strategy to scale up ML-driven science is to increase wet lab experiments' information density. We present a method based on a neural extension of compressed sensing to function space. We measure the activity of multiple different molecules simultaneously, rather than individually. Then, we deconvolute the molecule-activity map during model training. Co-design of wet lab experiments and learning algorithms provably leads to orders-of-magnitude gains in information density. We demonstrate on antibodies and cell therapies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Computation in algorithmic trading to adapt to non-stationary market regimes.

Method: Used 500 autonomous agents with LSTM/Transformer-based perception and genetic survival mechanisms in high-frequency cryptocurrency trading.

Result: Training showed high returns (Validation APY > 300%), but in live performance, there was significant capital loss (>70%).

Conclusion: Model overfitted to low-entropy time-series data, suffered from survivor bias, and required unavailable order-flow data, making it fragile and ineffective.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) is frequently hypothesized to be the "Holy Grail" of algorithmic trading, promising systems that adapt autonomously to non-stationary market regimes. This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY $>300\%$) and live performance (Capital Decay $>70\%$). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting of \textit{Aleatoric Uncertainty} in low-entropy time-series, the \textit{Survivor Bias} inherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data. Our findings provide empirical evidence that increasing model complexity in the absence of information asymmetry exacerbates systemic fragility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Mars' magnetic environment and its interaction with solar wind conditions, which play a crucial role in atmospheric ion escape processes.

Method: The researchers employed a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), trained on MAVEN observations and physical laws, to reconstruct Mars' three-dimensional magnetosphere under varying solar wind conditions.

Result: The data-driven model successfully identified dependencies between Mars' magnetic field configurations and solar wind parameters, highlighting hemispheric asymmetries in field strength.

Conclusion: PINN is an effective and computationally efficient tool for reconstructing Mars' magnetism, offering new avenues for exploring solar wind-planet interactions.

Abstract: Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and θ_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.

Motivation: The paper aims to extend universal approximation theorems to rough path analysis and prove their effectiveness in applications involving Brownian motion and stochastic filtrations.

Method: The authors derive global universal approximation results for weighted rough path spaces and apply them to time-extended Brownian paths.

Result: Linear functionals on signatures can approximate any $L^p$ integrable stochastic processes, including solutions to stochastic differential equations.

Conclusion: The work establishes the density of linear functionals on signatures within rough path spaces, with significant implications for stochastic processes and their approximations.

Abstract: We establish $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems for general and non-anticipative functionals on suitable rough path spaces, showing that linear functionals acting on signatures of time-extended rough paths are dense with respect to an $L^p$-distance. To that end, we derive global universal approximation theorems for weighted rough path spaces. We demonstrate that these $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems apply in particular to Brownian motion. As a consequence, linear functionals on the signature of the time-extended Brownian motion can approximate any $p$-integrable stochastic process adapted to the Brownian filtration, including solutions to stochastic differential equations.

TL;DR: Researchers introduced a method that uses week-long intracranial and audio recordings to improve speech decoding from brain activity, achieving better performance by leveraging large datasets and addressing cross-day variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of small datasets and controlled experimental conditions in brain activity-based speech decoding, and to develop scalable methods for both real-life and controlled environments.

Method: A framework was devised using week-long intracranial and audio recordings for pretraining a contrastive learning model, which significantly increased dataset size and improved scalability.

Result: The proposed model outperformed traditional methods, with performance gains scaling log-linearly with the dataset size. It also revealed variability in brain activity patterns over multiple days.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable solution to model brain representations of speech and accommodates variability in neural recordings, paving the way for applications in diverse settings.

Abstract: Decoding speech from brain activity has typically relied on limited neural recordings collected during short and highly controlled experiments. Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.

TL;DR: A cepstrum-based pitch modification method for mel-spectrograms, compatible with mel-based vocoders without requiring training changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable pitch modification for mel-based vocoders, removing the need for additional model alterations or training.

Method: Modifies the cepstrum feature space to shift the harmonic structure by using pseudo-inverse mel transform, DCT, IDCT, and mel-filterbank.

Result: Validated experimentally with metrics on state-of-the-art vocoders and compared against traditional methods.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient approach for pitch modification, compatible with existing systems, without extra training requirements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method that can be applied to any mel-spectrogram representation. As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DACH-TIC, a hierarchical audio transformer model for infant cry classification, addressing robustness in noisy, varied environments. It outperforms existing methods with better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in infant cry classification are susceptible to noise, irrelevant cues, and variations in recording conditions. Addressing these issues is crucial for accurate neonatal distress detection.

Method: DACH-TIC combines causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, adversarial domain generalization, and multi-task supervision. It employs token-level and semantic encoders with causal attention masking and perturbation training.

Result: The proposed model surpasses baselines like HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer by 2.6% in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, with improved generalization across domains.

Conclusion: DACH-TIC provides robust and accurate infant cry classification and distress detection, proving effective in unseen environments. It offers practical applicability for neonatal acoustic systems.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework.
  DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation.
  Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective approximation theory in understanding the capabilities of shallow neural networks, particularly using time-frequency tools to generalize and enhance their performance.

Method: The authors utilize weighted modulation spaces and prove approximation bounds in Sobolev norms for networks equipped with localized time-frequency windows in activation units. They incorporate explicit control over constants in their analysis.

Result: They demonstrate that networks based on modulation achieve Sobolev approximation rates that are independent of dimensionality and superior to standard ReLU networks in both theory and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Modulation-based neural networks provide a powerful and efficient alternative to standard neural networks for approximation tasks in Sobolev spaces, with notable improvements in approximation rates and practical performance.

Abstract: We develop a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks using tools from time-frequency analysis. Working in weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, we prove dimension-independent approximation rates in Sobolev norms $W^{n,r}(Ω)$ for networks whose units combine standard activations with localized time-frequency windows. Our main result shows that for $f \in M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ one can achieve \[ \|f - f_N\|_{W^{n,r}(Ω)} \lesssim N^{-1/2}\,\|f\|_{M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})}, \] on bounded domains, with explicit control of all constants. We further obtain global approximation theorems on $\mathbf{R}^{d}$ using weighted modulation dictionaries, and derive consequences for Feichtinger's algebra, Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, and Barron spaces. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions confirm that modulation-based networks achieve substantially better Sobolev approximation than standard ReLU networks, consistent with the theoretical estimates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving data efficiency and model performance in analyzing dynamical systems using information metrics like Fisher Information and Shannon entropy.

Method: The study employs Fisher Information Matrix within the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework and visualizes information patterns to improve data sampled efficiency and model performance.

Result: Enhanced insights into system dynamics, improved sampling efficiency, and better performance for data-driven approaches demonstrated across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: Information metrics such as Fisher Information can guide principled sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency and reduce data requirements for data-driven model discovery.

Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a polynomial time algorithm to compute confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees and addresses constraints caused by high dimensionalities and ellipsoid condition numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees in high dimensions despite the NP-hard nature of the problem, especially under high condition numbers.

Method: The proposed algorithm leverages the primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality.

Result: The algorithm finds an ellipsoid $E$ with volume approximation guarantees and provides coverage probability near $1 − O(α/γ)$ for any $γ<α$. Additionally, computational hardness results justify the dependence of the approximation factor.

Conclusion: The paper advances robust confidence ellipsoid construction and provides the first polynomial time solution with approximation guarantees for cases like robust subspace recovery problems.

Abstract: We study the problem of finding confidence ellipsoids for an arbitrary distribution in high dimensions. Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\Pr_{D}[E] \ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $β$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $β$?
  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(β^{γd})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $β$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass for any $γ< α$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms in the VIRGO network while maintaining its scalability and real-world hierarchical structure.

Method: The proposal utilizes cryptographic techniques including encrypted join requests, manager-signed delegation certificates, and limited disclosure of public keys within direct manager-member relationships.

Result: PVTNs demonstrate scalability, dynamic management, and robust security capabilities without requiring global public key infrastructures.

Conclusion: By extending the VIRGO overlay with cryptographically enforced privacy and hierarchy replication, PVTNs offer a secure and scalable approach for structuring distributed systems.

Abstract: Hierarchical organization is a fundamental structure in real-world society, where authority and responsibility are delegated from managers to subordinates. The VIRGO network (Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for scalable grid computing) provides a scalable overlay for organizing distributed systems but lacks intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms. This paper proposes Private Virtual Tree Networks (PVTNs), a cryptographically enforced extension that leverages the VIRGO overlay to mirror real organizational hierarchies. In PVTNs, join requests are encrypted with the manager's public key to ensure confidentiality, while membership authorization is enforced through manager-signed delegation certificates. Public keys are treated as organizational secrets and are disclosed only within direct manager-member relationships, resulting in a private, non-enumerable virtual tree. Our work demonstrates, through the system model, protocols, security analysis, and design rationale, that PVTNs achieve scalability, dynamic management, and strong security guarantees without relying on global public key infrastructures.

TL;DR: The Lockchain Protocol enhances efficient transaction discovery and data verification for Bitcoin transactions, without using additional on-chain storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transaction discovery and verification in Bitcoin transactions is desired without adding storage burdens.

Method: The protocol repurposes the nLockTime field in Bitcoin transactions to compactly encode metadata for transaction discovery, utilizing past unused Unix timestamp ranges.

Result: The Lockchain Protocol enables indexers to identify and selectively inspect transactions based on the compact metadata header, improving scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The protocol solves transaction discovery issues using existing Bitcoin fields without introducing new cryptographic or storage methods.

Abstract: We describe the Lockchain Protocol, a lightweight Bitcoin meta-protocol that enables highly efficient transaction discovery at zero marginal block space cost, and data verification without introducing any new on-chain storage mechanism. The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.

*Perry Abdulkadir*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing safety guardrails for large language models (LLMs) using hyperparameter tuning rather than manual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in deploying LLMs behind safety guardrails, which are traditionally hand-tuned, brittle, and hard to reproduce.

Method: The authors employed a grid search and Optuna-based optimization approach to tune safety configurations of LLMs under a frozen model setup.

Result: Optuna effectively rediscovered optimal configurations with fewer resources compared to a grid search baseline, achieving better efficiency in evaluation and latency.

Conclusion: Treating safety guardrail design as a hyperparameter tuning problem can improve the robustness and efficiency of black-box LLM deployments under constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed behind safety guardrails such as system prompts and content filters, especially in settings where product teams cannot modify model weights. In practice these guardrails are typically hand-tuned, brittle, and difficult to reproduce. This paper studies a simple but practical alternative: treat safety guardrail design itself as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a frozen base model. Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency. A 48-point grid search over prompt combinations and filter modes establishes a baseline. I then run a black-box Optuna study over the same space and show that it reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time. The results suggest that viewing safety guardrails as tunable hyperparameters is a feasible way to harden black-box LLM deployments under compute and time constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextLeak, a framework to measure information leakage in In-Context Learning (ICL) when adapting large language models (LLMs) to specialized tasks with sensitive prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive task-specific exemplars in the context of ICL require reliable privacy-preserving mechanisms to prevent unintended leakage.

Method: ContextLeak uses a unique canary insertion method, embedding identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting specific queries to measure privacy leakage.

Result: It reveals leakage detection correlates with privacy budget ($ε$), and highlights poor trade-offs between privacy and utility in existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for improved privacy-preserving techniques in ICL, showcasing ContextLeak as a reliable auditing framework for detecting leakage.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a standard technique for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks by supplying task-specific exemplars within the prompt. However, when these exemplars contain sensitive information, reliable privacy-preserving mechanisms are essential to prevent unintended leakage through model outputs. Many privacy-preserving methods are proposed to protect the information leakage in the context, but there are less efforts on how to audit those methods. We introduce ContextLeak, the first framework to empirically measure the worst-case information leakage in ICL. ContextLeak uses canary insertion, embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. We apply ContextLeak across a range of private ICL techniques, both heuristic such as prompt-based defenses and those with theoretical guarantees such as Embedding Space Aggregation and Report Noisy Max. We find that ContextLeak tightly correlates with the theoretical privacy budget ($ε$) and reliably detects leakage. Our results further reveal that existing methods often strike poor privacy-utility trade-offs, either leaking sensitive information or severely degrading performance.

### [414] [DualGuard: Dual-stream Large Language Model Watermarking Defense against Paraphrase and Spoofing Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16182)
*Hao Li,Yubing Ren,Yanan Cao,Yingjie Li,Fang Fang,Shi Wang,Li Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DualGuard is a watermarking algorithm that addresses both paraphrase and spoofing attacks in large language models to enhance trust and attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in accessibility of large language models has led to risks of abuse, including misuse and intellectual property concerns. Current watermarking methods mainly target paraphrase attacks, neglecting spoofing attacks.

Method: DualGuard uses an adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism where two complementary watermarks are dynamically added based on semantic content to detect and trace spoofing and paraphrase attacks.

Result: Experiments across multiple models and datasets show that DualGuard achieves high performance in detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality.

Conclusion: DualGuard effectively represents a significant advance in watermarking techniques, addressing key vulnerabilities and enhancing trust and reliability in LLM applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud-based services, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly accessible through various web platforms. However, this accessibility has also led to growing risks of model abuse. LLM watermarking has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate such misuse and protect intellectual property. Existing watermarking algorithms, however, primarily focus on defending against paraphrase attacks while overlooking piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject harmful content, compromise watermark reliability, and undermine trust in attribution. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard, the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. DualGuard employs the adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism, in which two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on the semantic content. This design enables DualGuard not only to detect but also to trace spoofing attacks, thereby ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and language models demonstrate that DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing the state of LLM watermarking for real-world applications.

*Yuxuan Qiao,Dongqin Liu,Hongchang Yang,Wei Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies and evaluates privacy risks (TOP-R) inherent in multi-tool architectures driven by large language models. It proposes a solution to mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to address emerging privacy risks in autonomous agents using large language models and multi-tool orchestration.

Method: The authors established a formal framework to analyze the risks, constructed a benchmarking tool called TOP-Bench, introduced a holistic metric (H-Score), and proposed the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method.

Result: The study highlights the severity of privacy risks (RLR of 90.24%), while their method (PEP) effectively reduces the risk (RLR to 46.58%) and improves performance (H-Score: 0.624).

Conclusion: The study uncovers novel privacy risks in autonomous multi-tool agents, identifies deficiencies in current architectures, and offers a practical solution to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Driven by Large Language Models, the single-agent, multi-tool architecture has become a popular paradigm for autonomous agents due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.

*Hao Li,Yubing Ren,Yanan Cao,Yingjie Li,Fang Fang,Xuebin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents SemMark, a semantic-based watermarking method to protect Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) against imitation attacks, addressing deficits in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect EaaS from vulnerabilities like imitation attacks while maintaining semantic integrity, which is often overlooked in previous watermarking techniques.

Method: SemMark uses locality-sensitive hashing to embed semantic-aware watermarks strategically within the embedding space. It employs adaptive watermarking weight mechanisms to maintain semantic distribution.

Result: SemMark demonstrates high efficacy in imperceptibility, diversity, and harmlessness through experiments on diverse NLP datasets.

Conclusion: SemMark significantly enhances EaaS copyright protection by introducing semantic integrity in watermarking, outperforming existing methods in stealthiness and robustness.

Abstract: Benefiting from the superior capabilities of large language models in natural language understanding and generation, Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) has emerged as a successful commercial paradigm on the web platform. However, prior studies have revealed that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks. Existing methods protect the intellectual property of EaaS through watermarking techniques, but they all ignore the most important properties of embedding: semantics, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. To this end, we propose SemMark, a novel semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection. SemMark employs locality-sensitive hashing to partition the semantic space and inject semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, ensuring that the watermark signals remain imperceptible and diverse. In addition, we introduce the adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on the local outlier factor to preserve the original embedding distribution. Furthermore, we propose Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks and construct four scenarios to evaluate the watermarking method. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular NLP datasets, and SemMark achieves superior verifiability, diversity, stealthiness, and harmlessness.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates post-hoc text watermarking using LLMs for protection, traceability, and detection of text usage, aiming for a balance in quality and detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for watermarking existing text, enabling traceability and protection of AI-generated or existing copyrighted content.

Method: Post-hoc watermarking is employed where an LLM rewrites existing text while embedding statistical signals. Various techniques like beam search, multi-candidate generation, and entropy filtering are tested for optimal results.

Result: Efficient strategies with strong detectability and semantic fidelity are achieved for open-ended text, with certain surprising findings such as Gumbel-max outperforming alternatives. Challenges arise in watermarking certain domains, like code.

Conclusion: Post-hoc watermarking shows significant potential and reveals both its advantages and limitations, providing a basis for future applications and research.

Abstract: Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberattack data is limited, creating challenges in developing effective intrusion detection systems.

Method: Uses a progressive training technique and a dual-path VAE-GAN framework for generating realistic synthetic attack data, with domain-specific feature matching for semantic preservation.

Result: Synthetic data generated by PHANTOM allows models to achieve 98% weighted accuracy on real cyberattacks, confirming preserved data authenticity and diversity.

Conclusion: PHANTOM enhances synthetic data generation for privacy-preserving detection systems, though struggles with rare attack types due to imbalances.

Abstract: The scarcity of cyberattack data hinders the development of robust intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces PHANTOM, a novel adversarial variational framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic attack data. Its innovations include progressive training, a dual-path VAE-GAN architecture, and domain-specific feature matching to preserve the semantics of attacks. Evaluated on 100,000 network traffic samples, models trained on PHANTOM data achieve 98% weighted accuracy on real attacks.

*Junchi Lu,Xinke Li,Yuheng Liu,Qi Alfred Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper exposes a security threat in generative data pipelines where diffusion models can carry and propagate hidden backdoors, posing risks to downstream perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the security risks of using generative models for synthetic data augmentation, especially in relation to hidden backdoors.

Method: The study analyzes how diffusion models memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers, investigates their propagation to downstream models, and identifies the Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation phenomenon.

Result: The study finds that diffusion models can secretly store and transmit backdoor triggers in synthetic data pipelines, with triggers being more apparent in early stages of reverse generation.

Conclusion: Generative data pipelines are vulnerable to backdoor threats, and this paper highlights the need for mitigation strategies in synthetic data generation to ensure security.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative models such as diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation has greatly reduced the cost of data collection and labeling in downstream perception tasks. However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation.

*Sahibpreet Singh,Shikha Dhiman*

TL;DR: The paper explores the implications of generative AI on Indian criminal law, forensic integrity, and privacy, particularly in light of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the compatibility of Indian privacy laws with the rise of adversarial AI threats like deepfakes and anti-forensics in forensic investigations.

Method: The study uses a doctrinal legal methodology, combining statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks like IEEE and EU guidelines.

Result: Findings reveal vulnerabilities in AI such as data poisoning and algorithmic bias, along with tensions between data minimization rules and forensic requirements. Existing laws fail to address AI-driven crimes adequately.

Conclusion: Proposes integrating explainable AI (XAI) into a 'human-centric' forensic model and aligning Indian privacy statutes with international standards to combat synthetic media risks.

Abstract: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence into the digital ecosystem necessitates a critical re-evaluation of Indian criminal jurisprudence regarding computational forensics integrity. While algorithmic efficiency enhances evidence extraction, a research gap exists regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023's compatibility with adversarial AI threats, specifically anti-forensics and deepfakes. This study scrutinizes the AI "dual-use" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven "tool crimes" and "target crimes." Consequently, the research proposes a "human-centric" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility. These implications suggest that synchronizing Indian privacy statutes with international forensic standards is imperative to mitigate synthetic media risks, establishing a roadmap for future legislative amendments and technical standardization.

### [421] [VET Your Agent: Towards Host-Independent Autonomy via Verifiable Execution Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15892)
*Artem Grigor,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Simon Birnbach,Ivan Martinovic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VET, a framework for verifiable execution traces, allowing host-independent authentication of AI agent outputs to ensure autonomy in high-stakes domains. They evaluate its practicality with realistic workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of autonomy in agents operating in high-stakes domains due to potential tampering by the host controlling the infrastructure. The goal is to ensure trust in agents handling sensitive tasks.

Method: The authors propose a framework called VET, featuring the Agent Identity Document (AID) that enables host-independent output authentication. VET supports multiple proof systems like trusted hardware and cryptographic proofs.

Result: Upon implementing VET on an API-based LLM agent, they find it feasible, with overhead typically under 3x for current systems. They demonstrate this with a verifiable trading agent using a combination of Web Proofs and TEE Proxy.

Conclusion: VET's implementation demonstrates that achieving host-agnostic authentication is feasible with current technology, paving the way for systems that provide full host-independent autonomy in the future.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new generation of autonomous agents that operate over sustained periods and manage sensitive resources on behalf of users. Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.
  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).
  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.

*Sanjay Das,Swastik Bhattacharya,Shamik Kundu,Arnab Raha,Souvik Kundu,Kanad Basu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: State-Space Models (SSMs), like Mamba, outperform transformers in some contexts but are vulnerable to hardware attacks, such as bit-flip attacks, which cause severe accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs are gaining importance due to their efficiency and scalability as alternatives to transformer-based models. Understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for secure deployment.

Method: Development of RAMBO, a specific bit-flip attack framework targeting Mamba SSMs, followed by experiments on a cloze-style word-prediction task using the Mamba-1.4b model.

Result: Bit-flip attacks decreased the accuracy of the Mamba-1.4b model from 74.64% to 0% and increased perplexity drastically, highlighting extreme fragility.

Conclusion: The study underscores the critical need to address security vulnerabilities in SSMs, especially against hardware-induced adversarial attacks like BFAs.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), exemplified by the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as state-of-the-art sequence-modeling frameworks, offering linear-time scalability together with strong performance in long-context settings. Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6. These results demonstrate the pronounced fragility of SSMs to adversarial perturbations.

TL;DR: This paper explores machine learning methods to enhance network intrusion detection accuracy, using various algorithms and optimization techniques, with SVM achieving the best results on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasingly sophisticated cyber threats by improving the accuracy of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) through advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The study tested multiple machine learning algorithms, optimized them using grid and random search, and validated results via tenfold cross-validation and Recursive Feature Elimination.

Result: Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best performance post-optimization, with an accuracy of 99.12% and a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate, outperforming other classifiers.

Conclusion: Machine learning classifiers, especially optimized SVM, significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of network intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for securing networks by identifying and mitigating unauthorized activities indicative of cyberattacks. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes zero-day vulnerabilities from the Zero Day Initiative dataset, investigating trends, severity patterns, and predictive modeling methods for improved cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-day vulnerabilities pose severe risks due to their exploitability before patches are available, leaving systems defenseless during the exposure window.

Method: The study analyzes 415 vulnerabilities reported between January and April 2024, using data like CVSS scores, publication dates, and descriptions, and applies machine learning and deep learning for severity classification.

Result: The analysis provides insights into trends, identifies factors indicating high severity, and evaluates predictive models for effective severity classification.

Conclusion: Findings aim to help organizations enhance vulnerability management and preparedness, enabling better prioritization of patches and-response to zero-day threats.

Abstract: Zero-day vulnerabilities represent some of the most critical threats in cybersecurity, as they correspond to previously unknown flaws in software or hardware that are actively exploited before vendors can develop and deploy patches. During this exposure window, affected systems remain defenseless, making zero-day attacks particularly damaging and difficult to mitigate. This study analyzes the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability disclosures reported between January and April 2024, Cole [2025] comprising a total of 415 vulnerabilities. The dataset includes vulnerability identifiers, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0 scores, publication dates, and short textual descriptions. The primary objectives of this work are to identify trends in zero-day vulnerability disclosures, examine severity distributions across vendors, and investigate which vulnerability characteristics are most indicative of high severity. In addition, this study explores predictive modeling approaches for severity classification, comparing classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models using both structured metadata and unstructured textual descriptions. The findings aim to support improved patch prioritization strategies, more effective vulnerability management, and enhanced organizational preparedness against emerging zero-day threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to overcome hurdles in real-time AR/VR streaming, specifically high bandwidth and latency requirements, which hinder performance and user experience.

Method: A system is proposed where the origin server downsamples point cloud content and applies partial encryption. At the client end, the content is decrypted and enhanced using a machine learning-based super-resolution model.

Result: The study showcases nearly linear reductions in bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delays with lower downsampling resolutions. The super-resolution model almost perfectly reconstructs the original point clouds, with minimal reconstruction errors and reasonable inference times.

Conclusion: This approach successfully mitigates bandwidth and latency issues in AR/VR streaming while preserving content quality through effective reconstruction at the client side.

Abstract: Immersive formats such as 360° and 6DoF point cloud videos require high bandwidth and low latency, posing challenges for real-time AR/VR streaming. This work focuses on reducing bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delay, two key contributors to overall latency. We design a system that downsamples point cloud content at the origin server and applies partial encryption. At the client, the content is decrypted and upscaled using an ML-based super-resolution model. Our evaluation demonstrates a nearly linear reduction in bandwidth/latency, and encryption/decryption overhead with lower downsampling resolutions, while the super-resolution model effectively reconstructs the original full-resolution point clouds with minimal error and modest inference time.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autoencoder-based denoising method to defend object detection systems from adversarial attacks using Perlin noise, demonstrating partial recovery of performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models, critical for applications like autonomous driving and surveillance, are vulnerable to adversarial examples that degrade performance.

Method: The authors use Perlin noise to attack vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset and apply a convolutional autoencoder to denoise them, followed by evaluation using YOLOv5.

Result: Adversarial attacks reduced bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640 (43.3% degradation). The proposed defense method improved bbox mAP to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement).

Conclusion: Autoencoder-based denoising provides partial defense against adversarial attacks, improving detection performance without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection models play a critical role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose an autoencoder-based denoising defense to recover object detection performance degraded by adversarial perturbations. We conduct adversarial attacks using Perlin noise on vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset, apply a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to remove the perturbations, and evaluate detection performance using YOLOv5. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial attacks reduce bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640, representing a 43.3% performance degradation. After applying the proposed autoencoder defense, bbox mAP improves to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 increases from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement). These results indicate that autoencoder-based denoising can provide partial defense against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.

*Zhexi Lu,Hongliang Chi,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Yuseok Jeon,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICP-MIA, a novel black-box membership inference attack method that uses training dynamics, particularly the Optimization Gap, to assess membership in fine-tuned LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MIA techniques for LLMs struggle with poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratio due to reliance on signals like confidence scores that are intertwined with intrinsic properties of samples, such as rarity or difficulty.

Method: The proposed method, ICP-MIA, uses the theory of training dynamics, specifically the Optimization Gap, as a signal to detect membership. It introduces a training-free approach called In-Context Probing (ICP), which mimics fine-tuning via strategic input contexts. All probing methods rely on either reference data or self-perturbation techniques.

Result: Experiments across tasks and models demonstrate that ICP-MIA achieves superior performance compared to earlier black-box MIAs while maintaining low false positive rates. The study also analyzes how factors such as reference data alignment and model configuration impact the effectiveness of the attack.

Conclusion: ICP-MIA is positioned as an effective and theoretically informed framework for evaluating privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical privacy threat to fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), especially when models are adapted to domain-specific tasks using sensitive data. While prior black-box MIA techniques rely on confidence scores or token likelihoods, these signals are often entangled with a sample's intrinsic properties - such as content difficulty or rarity - leading to poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation). Experiments on three tasks and multiple LLMs show that ICP-MIA significantly outperforms prior black-box MIAs, particularly at low false positive rates. We further analyze how reference data alignment, model type, PEFT configurations, and training schedules affect attack effectiveness. Our findings establish ICP-MIA as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for auditing privacy risks in deployed LLMs.

### [428] [A Systematic Study of Code Obfuscation Against LLM-based Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16538)
*Xiao Li,Yue Li,Hao Wu,Yue Zhang,Yechao Zhang,Fengyuan Xu,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates how code obfuscation techniques affect the performance of large language models (LLMs) in detecting code vulnerabilities, offering a systematic evaluation across multiple programming languages and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the reliability and robustness of LLMs in detecting diverse types of code vulnerabilities, especially when exposed to obfuscation techniques.

Method: The authors categorize code obfuscation techniques into three classes and 11 subcategories, testing them across four programming languages and 15 LLMs from various model families using a consistent methodology.

Result: Code obfuscation has mixed impacts on the performance of LLMs in vulnerability detection, depending on factors like vulnerability traits, code characteristics, and model specifics.

Conclusion: There is a need to enhance LLM robustness in vulnerability detection by tackling open challenges and exploring future directions for better handling of obfuscation techniques.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.

*Gilad Gressel,Rahul Pankajakshan,Shir Rozenfeld,Ling Li,Ivan Franceschini,Krishnahsree Achuthan,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Romance-baiting scams can be fully automated using LLMs, which currently show higher trust and compliance compared to human operators; existing safety measures fail to detect such scams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing integration of LLMs in romance-baiting scams and explore their capabilities, impacts, and defenses in these operations.

Method: The study used interviews with insiders/victims, a blinded long-term comparison of LLM agents vs. human operators, and evaluations of commercial safety filters.

Result: LLMs were found to be widely used in scam operations (87% of conversational labor automatable), and performed better in trust-building and compliance. Popular safety filters failed to detect romance-baiting scams.

Conclusion: Romance scams are becoming increasingly automated using LLMs, posing serious challenges as current defenses are inadequate, necessitating improved safeguards against such operations.

Abstract: Romance-baiting scams have become a major source of financial and emotional harm worldwide. These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.
  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.

*Safwan Shaheer,G. M. Refatul Islam,Mohammad Rafid Hamid,Tahsin Zaman Jilan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the security risks of prompt injection attacks on small open-sourced LLMs by introducing novel defense mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption and potential deployment of small open-source LLMs in edge devices emphasize the need for robust security measures to combat prompt injection attacks.

Method: The authors assess current defenses, introduce a new iterative framework (using Chain of Thoughts) for refining defense prompts, and systematically evaluate their generated defenses against benchmarked attacks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed defenses significantly reduce attack success rates, lower false detection rates, and improve detection of goal-hijacking attacks in small LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the security of small open-source LLMs, supporting their broader and more secure applications in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: In this fast-evolving area of LLMs, our paper discusses the significant security risk presented by prompt injection attacks. It focuses on small open-sourced models, specifically the LLaMA family of models. We introduce novel defense mechanisms capable of generating automatic defenses and systematically evaluate said generated defenses against a comprehensive set of benchmarked attacks. Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our work recognizes the increasing relevance of small open-sourced LLMs and their potential for broad deployments on edge devices, aligning with future trends in LLM applications. We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks. Out strategies significantly reduce the success rates of the attacks and false detection rates while at the same time effectively detecting goal-hijacking capabilities, paving the way for more secure and efficient deployments of small and open-source LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [431] [Protecting Deep Neural Network Intellectual Property with Chaos-Based White-Box Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658)
*Sangeeth B,Serena Nicolazzo,Deepa K.,Vinod P*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new white-box watermarking method for deep neural networks (DNNs) using chaotic sequences to secure IP and validate ownership without affecting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of DNNs raises concerns about IP theft and model misuse. Current methods lack efficient tools to authenticate and protect ownership while refraining from affecting model utility.

Method: The authors propose embedding a chaotic-sequence-based watermark into intermediate DNN layers without altering the architecture or performance. They use logistic maps to create sensitive signature sequences and develop a genetic algorithm to retrieve watermarks for verification.

Result: The method retains accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets while ensuring the watermark's robustness against fine-tuning. Weight density plots and activation-based classifiers further validate ownership identification.

Conclusion: This watermarking approach is effective, efficient, and scalable in protecting DNN IP in real-world white-box scenarios, safeguarding against unauthorized use while preserving performance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.

### [432] [PrivateXR: Defending Privacy Attacks in Extended Reality Through Explainable AI-Guided Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16851)
*Ripan Kumar Kundu,Istiak Ahmed,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and differential privacy (DP) to enhance privacy in AI XR applications while preserving model utility and improving inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI XR systems leverage sensitive data like eye-tracking for innovative applications but face privacy risks, such as membership inference attacks and re-identification, which demand effective mitigation techniques.

Method: The authors propose using XAI to identify influential features in AI XR models, enabling selective application of DP to those features during inference to balance privacy preservation and model utility.

Result: The method reduces privacy attack success rates (MIA by up to 43%, RDA by up to 39%) while maintaining model accuracy (up to 97%) and doubling inference speed relative to traditional DP methods. It was successfully implemented on HTC VIVE Pro with a practical user interface.

Conclusion: The proposed XAI-guided DP framework offers a practical solution to enhance privacy in AI XR systems without compromising accuracy or performance, validated through real-world deployment.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.

*Bahman Abolhassani,Tugba Erpek,Kemal Davaslioglu,Yalin E. Sagduyu,Sastry Kompella*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses reactive jamming in robotic-swarm networks using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework based on QMIX algorithm to strengthen communication resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive jammers disrupt communication in robotic-swarm networks, compromising mission success, and conventional static countermeasures prove ineffective.

Method: The paper employs the QMIX algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to help agents coordinate decisions on transmit frequency and power under reactive jamming conditions.

Result: Simulation results indicate that QMIX rapidly learns cooperative policies, achieving high throughput and effective jamming resistance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The MARL framework leveraging QMIX is effective in improving communication resilience in robotic swarms operating in contested environments.

Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper discusses cooperative perception between vehicles, the privacy concerns associated with sharing raw sensor data, introduces a research framework called SHARP, and outlines open questions for its implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns with cooperative perception systems that rely on sharing raw sensor data and explore solutions to drive its adoption by automakers.

Method: The paper proposes SHARP, a research framework designed to minimize privacy leakage in cooperative perception systems.

Result: SHARP framework is introduced as a promising approach to balance raw data sharing for cooperative perception and privacy concerns.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for addressing privacy concerns in cooperative perception and presents SHARP as a solution while calling for collaboration across various domains to realize its potential.

Abstract: Cooperative perception between vehicles is poised to offer robust and reliable scene understanding. Recently, we are witnessing experimental systems research building testbeds that share raw spatial sensor data for cooperative perception. While there has been a marked improvement in accuracies and is the natural way forward, we take a moment to consider the problems with such an approach for eventual adoption by automakers. In this paper, we first argue that new forms of privacy concerns arise and discourage stakeholders to share raw sensor data. Next, we present SHARP, a research framework to minimize privacy leakage and drive stakeholders towards the ambitious goal of raw data based cooperative perception. Finally, we discuss open questions for networked systems, mobile computing, perception researchers, industry and government in realizing our proposed framework.

*Eduardo de la Cruz Fernández,Marcelo Karanik,Sascha Ossowski*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Lens, a model using Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting human values in text by employing a two-stage process. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to align autonomous computer systems' decision-making with human values by assessing how well their decisions reflect these values.

Method: Value Lens employs LLMs in a two-stage process: first to create a theory of values, and second to detect and critique values in text, ensuring verification and accuracy.

Result: Results show Value Lens is as effective or more effective than other existing models for detecting values.

Conclusion: Value Lens advances the identification of human values in autonomous systems, enhancing value-aligned decision-making through a novel text-based model leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: The autonomous decision-making process, which is increasingly applied to computer systems, requires that the choices made by these systems align with human values. In this context, systems must assess how well their decisions reflect human values. To achieve this, it is essential to identify whether each available action promotes or undermines these values. This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks.

### [436] [Evaluation of AI Ethics Tools in Language Models: A Developers' Perspective Case Stud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15791)
*Jhessica Silva,Diego A. B. Moreira,Gabriel O. dos Santos,Alef Ferreira,Helena Maia,Sandra Avila,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) for language models and evaluates their effectiveness by applying them to Portuguese language models. Findings reveal some ethical guidance but highlight shortcomings addressing unique aspects and identifying linguistic-specific harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the societal impact of language models and the need for effective tools to ensure trust, transparency, and responsible AI use, especially as AI systems grow pervasive.

Method: The authors conducted a literature survey of 213 AIETs, selected four specific tools, and evaluated them through interviews with developers of Portuguese language models, involving 35 hours of feedback collection.

Result: The selected AIETs provided general ethical guidance, but they lacked sufficient consideration for language-specific nuances such as idiomatic expressions and failed to detect potential harms pertinent to the Portuguese language.

Conclusion: The study concluded that while AIETs can provide a foundational framework for ethical considerations, they currently fall short for language-specific requirements and identifying contextual harms in certain languages, such as Portuguese.

Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes biases in large language models across various dimensions, revealing persistent inclinations despite efforts for neutrality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness and neutrality in LLMs amid their widespread adoption for decision-making and information access.

Method: The authors perform diverse experiments addressing political, ideological, alliance, language, and gender biases using tasks like news summarization, UN voting analyses, and multilingual story completions.

Result: Biases in LLMs were observed across several tested dimensions, despite alignment efforts.

Conclusion: LLMs, though designed for neutrality, exhibit inherent biases requiring attention for their safe deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become indispensable tools for acquiring information and supporting human decision-making. However, ensuring that these models uphold fairness across varied contexts is critical to their safe and responsible deployment. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive examination of four widely adopted LLMs, probing their underlying biases and inclinations across the dimensions of politics, ideology, alliance, language, and gender. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we investigate their political neutrality using news summarization, ideological biases through news stance classification, tendencies toward specific geopolitical alliances via United Nations voting patterns, language bias in the context of multilingual story completion, and gender-related affinities as revealed by responses to the World Values Survey. Results indicate that while the LLMs are aligned to be neutral and impartial, they still show biases and affinities of different types.

### [438] [Explainable Ethical Assessment on Human Behaviors by Generating Conflicting Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15793)
*Yuxi Sun,Wei Gao,Hongzhan Lin,Jing Ma,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study introduces ClarityEthic, a method to enhance AI's ability to better predict and explain the ethical valence of human actions by considering conflicting social norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems struggle with explainability and trustworthiness when assessing human actions due to the lack of explicit grounding in social norms.

Method: A novel method, ClarityEthic, applies contrastive learning to generate conflicting social norms that enhance the moral reasoning and valence prediction abilities of language models.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ClarityEthic outperforms existing methods, and human evaluations validate the plausibility of the generated social norm explanations.

Conclusion: Incorporating conflicting social norms in valence prediction reinforces moral reasoning in AI, making assessments more trustworthy and explainable.

Abstract: Human behaviors are often guided or constrained by social norms, which are defined as shared, commonsense rules. For example, underlying an action ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \textit{bravery} against \textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors.

### [439] [Cross-Language Bias Examination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16029)
*Yuxuan Liang,Marwa Mahmoud*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to assess bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages using explicit and implicit evaluation methods. It provides insights into cross-lingual bias differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities, their biases across languages remain underexplored. There is a need to establish fairness and equity in multilingual models to ensure unbiased representation across diverse cultures and languages.

Method: The study combines the BBQ benchmark for explicit bias and a prompt-based Implicit Association Test (IAT) for implicit bias. These methods are applied across five languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, French, Spanish) to evaluate bias types and variations.

Result: Results show significant variation in stereotype bias across languages. For instance, Arabic and Spanish exhibit stronger stereotype biases, while English and Chinese show lower bias levels. Age exhibits low explicit bias but high implicit bias, showcasing complexity in bias evaluation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of cross-lingual bias analysis in LLMs. It sets a foundation for developing fair and effective multilingual LLMs, addressing implicit biases and ensuring equitable representation across languages.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative multilingual bias evaluation framework for assessing bias in Large Language Models, combining explicit bias assessment through the BBQ benchmark with implicit bias measurement using a prompt-based Implicit Association Test. By translating the prompts and word list into five target languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, we directly compare different types of bias across languages. The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks. These findings indicate that LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. This study fills a key research gap by providing a comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis. Ultimately, our work establishes a foundation for the development of equitable multilingual LLMs, ensuring fairness and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures.

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges that artificial intelligence (AI) poses to cultural rights and the right to development, highlighting gaps in governance frameworks and suggesting avenues for policy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and governance frameworks for how AI affects cultural rights and the right to development amidst its increasing global influence.

Method: The paper conceptually analyzes the limitations of AI in terms of cultural and developmental assumptions and explores their impacts on individuals and societies. It also identifies gaps in AI governance frameworks linked to these rights.

Result: The study reveals significant tensions and gaps in how existing AI governance frameworks handle cultural rights and the right to development, emphasizing the risks to marginalized communities.

Conclusion: The paper calls for integrating cultural and developmental considerations into global AI governance and outlines pathways for future academic and policy efforts to protect these rights.

Abstract: Cultural rights and the right to development are essential norms within the wider framework of international human rights law. However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.
  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law. Finally, it outlines avenues for future research and policy development based on existing conversations in global AI governance.

TL;DR: The paper presents the concept of "agentic environments," a sustainable AI framework integrating generative AI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce environmental impact and improve privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the environmental footprint and privacy concerns associated with current cloud-centric AI systems by leveraging generative AI and edge computing.

Method: The research combines secondary data with primary insights from focus groups and semi-structured interviews conducted with professionals from leading technology firms.

Result: Agentic environments show potential to improve sustainability and data privacy by optimizing resource utilization and reducing cloud dependency.

Conclusion: Edge-driven, sustainability-focused AI frameworks such as agentic environments can address environmental and privacy challenges while fostering sustainable ecosystems.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), have made human-computer interactions more frequent, efficient, and accessible across sectors ranging from banking to healthcare. AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy. The study concludes with recommendations for edge-driven deployment models to reduce reliance on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.

*Bingxue An,Tiffany M. Tang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus approach to address inconsistencies in dimension reduction visualizations by combining information from multiple methods and leveraging multi-view learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and conflicts in visualizations produced by different dimension reduction methods and their hyperparameters, aiming for more robust, reliable, and reproducible analysis.

Method: A consensus-based model utilizing multi-view learning to identify stable and shared patterns among different dimension reduction visualizations, creating a unified low-dimensional visualization.

Result: The proposed consensus visualization method is demonstrated to effectively preserve shared data structures, as shown through simulated and real-world data, and is robust against variation in dimension reduction methods and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The consensus approach enhances the trustworthiness and reproducibility of dimension reduction visualizations, providing a unified representation of shared structures across different methods and settings.

Abstract: A plethora of dimension reduction methods have been developed to visualize high-dimensional data in low dimensions. However, different dimension reduction methods often output different and possibly conflicting visualizations of the same data. This problem is further exacerbated by the choice of hyperparameters, which may substantially impact the resulting visualization. To obtain a more robust and trustworthy dimension reduction output, we advocate for a consensus approach, which summarizes multiple visualizations into a single consensus dimension reduction visualization. Here, we leverage ideas from multi-view learning in order to identify the patterns that are most stable or shared across the many different dimension reduction visualizations, or views, and subsequently visualize this shared structure in a single low-dimensional plot. We demonstrate that this consensus visualization effectively identifies and preserves the shared low-dimensional data structure through both simulated and real-world case studies. We further highlight our method's robustness to the choice of dimension reduction method and hyperparameters -- a highly-desirable property when working towards trustworthy and reproducible data science.

*Nora M. Villanueva,Marta Sestelo,Luis Meira-Machado*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a k-means and log-rank test-based method for clustering survival curves, offering an efficient alternative to computationally intense bootstrap methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bootstrap-based clustering methods for survival curves are computationally demanding, challenging scalability for large datasets.

Method: A novel clustering approach using k-means and the log-rank test to identify survival curve clusters without the need for resampling.

Result: Simulation studies show the proposed method achieves comparable results to existing methods, with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The log-rank-based clustering process is practical, scalable, and time-efficient, suitable for large-scale survival data analysis in medical and epidemiological research.

Abstract: Survival analysis encompasses a broad range of methods for analyzing time-to-event data, with one key objective being the comparison of survival curves across groups. Traditional approaches for identifying clusters of survival curves often rely on computationally intensive bootstrap techniques to approximate the null hypothesis distribution. While effective, these methods impose significant computational burdens. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the k-means and log-rank test to efficiently identify and cluster survival curves. Our method eliminates the need for computationally expensive resampling, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining statistical reliability. By systematically evaluating survival curves and determining optimal clusters, the proposed method ensures a practical and scalable alternative for large-scale survival data analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves results comparable to existing bootstrap-based clustering methods while dramatically improving computational efficiency. These findings suggest that the log-rank-based clustering procedure offers a viable and time-efficient solution for researchers working with multiple survival curves in medical and epidemiological studies.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Transformer architectures handle incomplete experimental data by evaluating performance across different benchmark fluid dynamics problems. Transformers outperform traditional models in scenarios with missing data but underperform when full state variables are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in modeling dynamical systems when certain variables are missing or difficult to measure experimentally.

Method: The authors evaluated Transformer architectures on three benchmark fluid dynamics problems and compared their performance to a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network (metriplectic bias).

Result: Transformers demonstrated better performance in handling systems with missing state variables, outperforming the metriplectic neural network in such scenarios. However, the metriplectic model performed better when full state variables were available.

Conclusion: Transformer models can effectively deal with lack of experimental data, offering lower errors in complex systems with missing variables, though they may not surpass other models in fully known variable scenarios.

Abstract: It is well known that the lack of information about certain variables necessary for the description of a dynamical system leads to the introduction of historical dependence (lack of Markovian character of the model) and noise. Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine machine learning's predictive capabilities with statistical methods for deeper structural parameter inference in high-dimensional econometric models.

Result: The `xtdml` package successfully implements these methods, demonstrating their utility through examples using simulated and real longitudinal data.

Conclusion: `xtdml` is an effective tool for applying DML methods in panel regression models, enhancing econometric research through improved predictive and statistical inference capabilities.

Abstract: The double machine learning (DML) method combines the predictive power of machine learning with statistical estimation to conduct inference about the structural parameter of interest. This paper presents the R package `xtdml`, which implements DML methods for partially linear panel regression models with low-dimensional fixed effects, high-dimensional confounding variables, proposed by Clarke and Polselli (2025). The package provides functionalities to: (a) learn nuisance functions with machine learning algorithms from the `mlr3` ecosystem, (b) handle unobserved individual heterogeneity choosing among first-difference transformation, within-group transformation, and correlated random effects, (c) transform the covariates with min-max normalization and polynomial expansion to improve learning performance. We showcase the use of `xtdml` with both simulated and real longitudinal data.

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) show potential in biomedical imaging but face challenges in clinical evaluation and deployment, needing advancements in causal reasoning, trustworthiness, and validation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models aim to advance AI by moving beyond narrow pattern recognition to emulate clinical reasoning, spatial understanding, and multimodal data integration in biomedical imaging.

Method: Critically assess FMs in biomedical imaging by analyzing their capabilities, limitations, taxonomy of reasoning, causal inference needs, and deployment challenges.

Result: The analysis reveals that FMs are limited in achieving genuine cognition and face biases and safety issues while holding promise for beneficial clinical tools.

Conclusion: Emerging FMs won't replace human expertise but could augment clinical practice by focusing on hybrid, causally aware, and safe systems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are driving a prominent shift in artificial intelligence across different domains, including biomedical imaging. These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.

TL;DR: StructBioReasoner is a multi-agent system to design biologics targeting IDPs. It utilizes a tournament-based framework and advanced computational tools to explore vast design spaces efficiently, achieving significant results in binding energy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of designing biologics for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack stable structures and are considered "undruggable." IDPs are critical therapeutic targets, especially in cancer-related diseases.

Method: The authors developed StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system with a tournament-based reasoning framework. Agents utilize literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, simulations, and stability analysis, enabling coordinated execution on HPC infrastructure.

Result: When tested on proteins Der f 21 and NMNAT-2, StructBioReasoner produced biologics with improved binding performance, with over 50% outperforming human-designed reference binders for Der f 21 and identifying key binding modes for NMNAT-2 from a large binder dataset.

Conclusion: StructBioReasoner provides a scalable approach for therapeutic discovery by leveraging multi-agent systems and advanced computations, setting the stage for further innovation in targeting IDPs on high-performance computing platforms.

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent crucial therapeutic targets due to their significant role in disease -- approximately 80\% of cancer-related proteins contain long disordered regions -- but their lack of stable secondary/tertiary structures makes them "undruggable". While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms.
