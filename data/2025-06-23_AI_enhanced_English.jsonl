To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the\nPast for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs\nsparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS\ncaptures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns\n(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative\npositions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively\npredict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging\nlong-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as\nthe base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\\times$\nspeedup over full attention and 9.6$\\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval\non an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,\nwhile preserving generation accuracy.

Knowledge distillation with Direct\nPreference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing\nthe conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.\nHowever, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the\nteacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the\nteacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware\nDPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based\ndistillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical\nvalidation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring\nperformance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in\nin-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve\nnear-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's\n-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model\n(14.0% win rate).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces daDPO, a novel approach combining preference optimization and knowledge distillation to enhance the conversational performance of smaller LLMs.", "motivation": "Bridging the performance gap between large and small language models in resource-constrained settings by utilizing teacher models better.", "method": "The authors propose daDPO, leveraging both teacher preferences and output distributions for unified preference optimization and knowledge distillation.", "result": "Using daDPO, pruned Vicuna1.5-7B achieves near-teacher performance, and Qwen2.5-1.5B occasionally exceeds its teacher's performance.", "conclusion": "daDPO is superior to existing methods, showing both theoretical and practical promise in advancing efficient LLM distillation technologies."}}

Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic\ninteraction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane\nchanges. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and\nfully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide\nbenchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative\nperception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception.

In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an\nopposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal\nsignal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful\nattack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple\nsampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source\nGPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.\nBesides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against\npopular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces BEAT, a black-box defense mechanism to detect and deactivate backdoors in Large Language Models (LLMs), by measuring distortions in output distributions caused by triggered inputs.", "motivation": "Backdoor attacks on LLMs with hidden triggers evade safety audits and pose serious risks in real-world black-box settings, such as LLM as a Service (LLMaaS), due to the semantic complexity of malicious commands.", "method": "The proposed BEAT defense relies on detecting triggered inputs by measuring the distortion in output distribution before and after concatenating a sample with probes, focusing on refusal signals rather than sample-specific attack behaviors.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the\ncomplex structures of heterogeneous graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning (MHCL) framework using multiple hyperbolic spaces for better representation of heterogeneous graphs' diverse power-law structures.", "motivation": "Heterogeneous graphs have complex and diverse power-law structures, but existing hyperbolic graph embeddings fail to capture this diversity using a single hyperbolic space.", "method": "MHCL leverages multiple hyperbolic spaces to represent the structural diversity corresponding to metapaths, combined with a contrastive learning approach to enhance the discriminability of metapath embeddings.", "result": "Experiments show MHCL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, demonstrating its capability to capture heterogeneous graph structures.", "conclusion": "MHCL effectively addresses limitations in existing methods by using multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning to improve graph representation, setting a new benchmark in graph-based machine learning tasks."}}

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.
