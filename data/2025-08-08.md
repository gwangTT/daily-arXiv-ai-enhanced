### [1] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an LLM-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance, offering actionable recommendations by combining anomaly detection, bearing vibration analysis, and multi-agentic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial maintenance often depends on timely intervention to prevent failures and boost efficiency, which calls for advanced methods to move from anomaly detection to actionable recommendations.

Method: The approach integrates LLMs to process serialized bearing vibration data and classify fault types, while leveraging multi-agentic systems for retrieving procedural knowledge from manuals and web searches.

Result: Experimental tests show the system effectively detects anomalies, identifies faults, and provides maintenance guidance tailored to industrial needs.

Conclusion: The study proposes a scalable framework leveraging LLMs, addressing the gap between monitoring and actionable planning, and enhancing prescriptive maintenance across industries.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current approaches that focus solely on reasoning decomposition without explicit API selection, thereby enhancing task efficiency and accuracy in geospatial contexts.

Method: GeoFlow introduces detailed tool-calling objectives for agents to guide geospatial API invocation during runtime, improving workflow outcomes.

Result: GeoFlow improves agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold across leading large language model families compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GeoFlow enhances efficiency and reduces computational resource usage in geospatial APIs, offering a significant improvement over existing solutions.

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows
for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition
and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed
tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow
increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold
across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [3] [Who is a Better Player: LLM against LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04720)
*Yingjie Zhou,Jiezhang Cao,Farong Wen,Li Xu,Yanwei Jiang,Jun Jia,Ronghui Li,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Zhou,Xiongkuo Min,Jie Guo,Zicheng Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an adversarial benchmarking framework using board games to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), offering insights into their technical and emotional performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional Q&A-based evaluation methods for LLMs by introducing a framework for adversarial competition through board games.

Method: The authors propose Qi Town, a platform supporting 5 games with 20 LLM-driven players, employing Elo ratings, Performance Loop Graphs (PLG), and Positive Sentiment Score (PSS) for evaluation in a round-robin tournament format.

Result: Experimental results highlight LLMs’ adaptability in stressful environments and reveal instabilities in skill play through cyclic win-loss patterns observed in PLGs.

Conclusion: LLMs show promising emotional resilience but face challenges in consistent strategic gameplay, requiring further research to understand instabilities in performance.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

### [4] [Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for Autonomous Web-based Geographical Information Systems (AWebGIS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04846)
*Mahdi Nazari Ashani,Ali Asghar Alesheikh,Saba Kazemi,Kimya Kheirkhah,Yasin Mohammadi,Fatemeh Rezaie,Amir Mahdi Manafi,Hedieh Zarkesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores three approaches for autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS), finding that a client-side small language model (SLM) achieves the best accuracy and eliminates reliance on centralized servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more intuitive and private AWebGIS systems that avoid the scalability and privacy issues of cloud-based systems relying on large language models.

Method: The study compares three AWebGIS methods: (1) a cloud-based LLM, (2) a semi-automated offline model using classical machine learning, and (3) a client-side fine-tuned small language model (SLM) executed in a web browser.

Result: The client-side SLM (T5-small model) achieved the highest performance with an exact match accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of 0.99, and high ROUGE scores (1 and L at 0.98).

Conclusion: Browser-executable models like client-side SLMs are highly feasible for AWebGIS tasks, offering advantages in privacy, scalability, and computational efficiency over traditional cloud-based solutions.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

### [5] [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848)
*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), showing that while improvements exist under ideal settings, performance drops significantly in real-world, non-ideal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in realistic, non-ideal scenarios, as current benchmarks focus primarily on idealized settings.

Method: The study identified three non-ideal reasoning scenarios (summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering), fine-tuned LLMs and an LVLM using RL with a policy-gradient algorithm, and evaluated performance on eight datasets.

Result: RL fine-tuning improved reasoning under idealized conditions but led to significant performance drops across the three non-ideal scenarios, revealing major reasoning deficits.

Conclusion: Current RL methods for enhancing LLM reasoning are insufficient for non-ideal scenarios, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and methods to assess and address these limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

### [6] [ConfAgents: A Conformal-Guided Multi-Agent Framework for Cost-Efficient Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04915)
*Huiya Zhao,Yinghao Zhu,Zixiang Wang,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent framework for healthcare research, addressing limitations in existing systems. It refines its strategies autonomously and outperforms existing frameworks in evaluations using a new benchmark, EHRFlowBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current AI agents in healthcare research, which are static and predefined, making them ineffective as strategic planners in complex domains like healthcare.

Method: The paper proposes HealthFlow, an AI agent with a meta-level evolution mechanism that autonomously refines its high-level strategies by learning from procedural successes and failures, along with introducing EHRFlowBench for realistic task evaluation.

Result: HealthFlow demonstrated significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art frameworks based on experiments in healthcare-related tasks.

Conclusion: The research represents a shift towards self-evolving AI agents in healthcare, emphasizing smarter strategic planning and autonomy for enhancing scientific discovery.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [7] [The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein--Ligand Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006)
*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game-theoretic framework that enhances molecular docking accuracy by addressing disparities in ligand and protein docking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task molecular docking models underperform in ligand docking due to the structural differences between ligands and proteins, creating the need for a more adaptive framework.

Method: Adopting a game-theoretic approach, the authors model ligand and protein interactions as a two-player Docking Game and introduce the Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm for iterative mutual refinement.

Result: The LoopPlay algorithm delivers approximately a 10% improvement in predicting binding modes over existing methods, as validated on public datasets.

Conclusion: LoopPlay offers a promising enhancement to molecular docking accuracy, benefiting drug discovery through its innovative game-theoretic design.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

### [8] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) for integrating complex urban spatial datasets, proposing a promising alternative to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based and machine learning methods for integrating spatial data have limitations, including inability to generalize edge cases and the need for extensive labeled datasets.

Method: Experiments evaluated the spatial reasoning skills of LLMs, tested their ability to generalize computational challenges, and introduced a review-and-refine method to improve performance.

Result: LLMs displayed spatial reasoning abilities, but struggled with complex tasks involving computational geometry. By reducing spatial reasoning dependency and using the review-and-refine method, their performance improved significantly.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as a flexible alternative to existing data integration methods. Practical use cases and future enhancements are promising for advancing urban spatial data integration.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

### [9] [Cognitive Duality for Adaptive Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05081)
*Jiarun Liu,Chunhong Zhang,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogniWeb, an AGI agent architecture for web navigation, combining offline learning and online exploration by mimicking human cognitive dual-process theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AGI performance in web navigation tasks, bridging offline imitation learning and online exploration methods while addressing complex decision-making challenges.

Method: CogniWeb integrates dual-process cognitive theory (System 1 and System 2) to switch adaptively between intuitive fast processing and slow deliberate reasoning based on task demands.

Result: CogniWeb achieves a 43.96% success rate and reduces token usage by 75% on the WebArena benchmark.

Conclusion: CogniWeb provides effective and efficient web navigation capabilities by harmonizing offline and online learning paradigms using cognitive theories.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

### [10] [MedMKEB: A Comprehensive Knowledge Editing Benchmark for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05083)
*Dexuan Xu,Jieyi Wang,Zhongyan Chai,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Huamin Zhang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedMKEB, a benchmark designed for assessing medical multimodal large language models' ability to edit knowledge across text and image modalities, emphasizing its significance in improving medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of updating outdated or incorrect knowledge in medical multimodal large language models without requiring complete retraining.

Method: MedMKEB is constructed with editing tasks such as counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge transfer, and robustness checks. It uses high-quality data and human expert validation for reliability.

Result: Experiments expose the limitations of current medical multimodal large language models' approach to knowledge editing and underscore the necessity for advanced editing strategies.

Conclusion: MedMKEB serves as a standard framework to drive progress in creating efficient and reliable knowledge-editing mechanisms for medical AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

### [11] [EasySize: Elastic Analog Circuit Sizing via LLM-Guided Heuristic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05113)
*Xinyue Wu,Fan Hu,Shaik Jani Babu,Yi Zhao,Xinfei Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize introduces a lightweight framework for analog circuit gate sizing, leveraging finetuned AI models and dynamic loss functions. It achieves high performance across various technology nodes while reducing simulation resources and human expertise dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges in analog circuit design, specifically the need for a fast, universal, and stable gate sizing framework that minimizes human expertise and computational cost.

Method: The paper introduces EasySize, which uses a finetuned Qwen3-8B model and heuristic search algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Task-specific dynamic loss functions are constructed based on the Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics.

Result: EasySize demonstrates strong performance on operational amplifier netlists across technology nodes (180nm, 45nm, 22nm) without additional targeted training. It surpasses the AutoCkt framework in 86.67% of tasks with a reduction in simulation resource usage by over 96.67%.

Conclusion: EasySize offers a portable and resource-efficient solution for analog circuit gate sizing, reducing dependency on human expertise and computation while maintaining strong cross-node performance. The framework will be open-sourced to benefit the broader community.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

*Peer-Benedikt Degen,Igor Asanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a Socratic AI Tutor designed to foster metacognitive engagement among students, showing its potential for hybrid learning ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how generative AI can be utilized in higher education to enhance students' cognitive and reflective thinking.

Method: A controlled experiment conducted with 65 pre-service teacher students comparing the Socratic AI Tutor with a regular AI chatbot.

Result: Students engaging with the Socratic AI Tutor experienced significantly greater support for critical and reflective thinking.

Conclusion: The findings support a shift towards orchestrated AI systems in education to boost tailored learning and scalability, while addressing institutional implications.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

### [13] [Graph-based Event Log Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05145)
*Sebastiano Dissegna,Chiara Di Francescomarino,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks to reconstruct incomplete events in process mining logs, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the lack of quality in real-world event logs due to missing information, especially during manual recording or data acquisition issues.

Method: The authors develop a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model to reconstruct missing event attributes and evaluate it using synthetic and real event logs against an autoencoder-based approach.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing multiple event attributes compared to state-of-the-art model-free approaches.

Conclusion: The use of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks offers a more expressive and accurate solution for reconstructing missing information in event logs, addressing limitations in existing techniques.

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

*Zhuohang Jiang,Pangjing Wu,Xu Yuan,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QA-Dragon enhances multimodal reasoning in knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering by introducing dynamic retrieval strategies, achieving improved performance in accuracy and knowledge overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods for Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to perform multi-hop reasoning and integrate up-to-date, multimodal knowledge.

Method: QA-Dragon integrates a domain router for domain-specific reasoning and a dynamic search router to flexibly retrieve and combine text and image data for complex Visual Question Answering.

Result: QA-Dragon improves answer accuracy by 5.06% (single-source tasks), 6.35% (multi-source tasks), and 5.03% (multi-turn tasks), showcasing enhanced reasoning and performance.

Conclusion: QA-Dragon effectively addresses limitations of existing RAG systems by enabling dynamic and flexible multimodal reasoning strategies, demonstrating significant advantages for challenging VQA tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional communication methods in maintenance organizations struggle with challenges like information overload and delayed responses due to complex entity relationships.

Method: The framework integrates RDF graph databases with large language models and employs a planning-orchestration architecture. This combination processes natural language queries and targets precise audiences.

Result: The solution facilitates intuitive query formulation involving entities like equipment and engineers while delivering explainable and trust-building results.

Conclusion: The approach improves organizational communication efficiency and maintains trust through transparency and precise audience targeting.

Abstract: In large-scale maintenance organizations, identifying subject matter experts
and managing communications across complex entities relationships poses
significant challenges -- including information overload and longer response
times -- that traditional communication approaches fail to address effectively.
We propose a novel framework that combines RDF graph databases with LLMs to
process natural language queries for precise audience targeting, while
providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid architecture combining decision trees and LLMs for reasoning tasks using a coordinated multi-agent framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning tasks' interpretability, consistency, and performance by combining symbolic decision trees with LLMs.

Method: Decision trees and random forests are embedded as callable modules within a unified system for symbolic reasoning, coupled with LLMs for abductive reasoning and generalization, orchestrated centrally for input coherence.

Result: The system shows notable improvements in reasoning benchmarks, including ProofWriter (+7.2%), GSM8k (+5.3%), and ARC (+6.0%).

Conclusion: The approach enhances neuro-symbolic reasoning by integrating symbolic reasoning rules and contextual inference, offering applications in fields like clinical decision-making and scientific inquiry.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

*Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes redefining the term 'agent' in AI by introducing a structured framework to address ambiguity and enhance research clarity, reproducibility, and policy development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in the term 'agent' has created challenges in research communication, evaluation, reproducibility, and policy-making, especially with advancements in AI such as large language models.

Method: The authors perform a historical analysis, study contemporary usage, and propose a framework defining minimum criteria for an agent, along with a multidimensional spectrum of system characteristics.

Result: The framework introduces clear criteria and dimensions for defining agents, addressing potential objections and offering recommendations for standardizing terminology and adopting this approach.

Conclusion: Redefining 'agent' and adopting the proposed framework improves clarity in research communication, aids in reproducibility, and supports policy-making effectively.

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NomicLaw, a simulation where LLMs collaboratively create laws and measure social behaviors like trust and alliances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs behave in complex multi-agent settings, especially in legal and ethical deliberations, addressing a gap in empirical understanding.

Method: The researchers developed NomicLaw, a structured simulation where LLMs propose, justify, and vote on legal rules, analyzing trust, alliances, and strategic language.

Result: LLMs demonstrated capabilities to form alliances, engage in strategic persuasion, and adapt rhetoric in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups.

Conclusion: The study reveals LLMs' latent social reasoning and suggests their potential in legal settings, influencing the design of future autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

### [19] [Minimal Model Reasoning in Description Logics: Don't Try This at Home!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05350)
*Federica Di Stefano,Quentin Manière,Magdalena Ortiz,Mantas Šimkus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores minimal model reasoning in Description Logics (DLs), showing concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable for $
\mathcal{EL}$. They impose acyclicity conditions to regain decidability and derive complexity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimal model reasoning is fundamental in knowledge representation, but understanding within DLs remains limited, especially for "pure" minimal models.

Method: The authors analyzed reasoning in DLs under "pure" minimal model constraints, checked decidability limits, applied acyclicity constraints and studied complexity.

Result: Concept satisfiability in minimal models for DLs is generally undecidable but regaining decidability is possible under acyclicity conditions, below double exponential time. Further complexity results are established.

Conclusion: Reasoning with minimal models in DLs faces significant challenges due to high complexity or undecidability, but adding structural restrictions can provide practical avenues for decidability.

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces StructVRM, a novel method for fine-grained reward mechanisms in multimodal reasoning tasks, showing state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models lack effective mechanisms for partial correctness in complex reasoning tasks, highlighting a need for structured feedback systems.

Method: The authors propose StructVRM, leveraging a model-based verifier for sub-question-level feedback, which moves away from rigid string matching and adopts semantic/mathematical equivalence for scoring.

Result: StructVRM demonstrated state-of-the-art results in six out of twelve multimodal benchmarks, including the newly introduced STEM-Bench for high-difficulty reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Structured and verifiable reward systems significantly enhance multimodal models' reasoning abilities in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time predictive maintenance pipeline for Intelligent Transportation Systems with over 98% F-measure and 99% accuracy using the MetroPT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for efficient predictive maintenance in Intelligent Transportation Systems, especially in railway operations where accurate fault prediction can improve safety, reduce costs, and ensure optimal service availability.

Method: The proposed solution includes a novel online processing pipeline with a sample pre-processing module to generate features dynamically, an incremental classification approach using Machine Learning models, and an explainability module to provide natural language and visual explanations.

Result: The pipeline achieved over 98% F-measure and 99% accuracy on the MetroPT dataset. It remains robust under class imbalance and noise, and the explainability module effectively reflects decision-making.

Conclusion: The approach is validated for its methodological soundness and practical applicability in real-world operations, enabling early fault detection and swift, informed decision-making by maintenance teams.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPHY is a benchmark to assess Vision Language Models (VLMs) on physical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel in visual reasoning but fail in detailed attention and effective action planning, especially in physics-driven scenarios.

Method: Developed DeepPHY, a simulated benchmark combining environments of varying difficulty and fine-grained evaluation metrics.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs showed limited ability in applying physical knowledge to predictive control.

Conclusion: VLMs require improvement in understanding and reasoning for real-world, physics-based task execution.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how LLMs, integrated with cutting-edge technologies, can enhance chemists' capabilities in organic synthesis by accelerating discoveries and promoting greener chemistry practices.

Method: The paper surveys the integration of LLMs with graph neural networks, quantum calculations, and real-time spectroscopy to create automated and data-driven systems. It reviews milestones, limitations, and current initiatives in these integrations.

Result: LLMs, enhanced with additional technologies, can effectively reduce discovery cycles, improve the environmental impact of molecular innovation, and democratize access to AI-assisted chemistry tools.

Conclusion: Coupling LLMs with complementary technologies and addressing their limitations provides a pathway for safer, efficient, and inclusive AI-driven molecular innovation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the importance of incorporating geographic variability in AI alignment, emphasizing the need for context-aware AI systems that account for cultural, legal, and political nuances globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in ensuring AI systems generate outputs sensitive to geographic and societal differences, particularly as AI influences global perspectives at scale.

Method: The authors review geographic research challenges, propose future directions, and outline methodologies to evaluate alignment sensitivity of AI systems.

Result: They highlight the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all alignment approaches, illustrating the necessity for more context-aware AI solutions, especially with the advent of Agentic AI.

Conclusion: A call for geographic and temporal awareness in alignment approaches is made, advocating for AI systems to adapt outputs based on location-specific contexts to foster fair and truthful representation.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

*Matteo Prandi,Vincenzo Suriani,Federico Pierucci,Marcello Galisai,Daniele Nardi,Piercosma Bisconti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Bench-2-CoP," a framework to evaluate shortcomings in current AI benchmarks against EU AI Act standards, revealing major gaps in systemic risk coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the emergence of regulations like the EU AI Act, there is a need for frameworks that measure AI's systemic risks beyond legacy benchmarks, which inadequately address these concerns.

Method: The Bench-2-CoP framework uses LLM-as-judge analysis to map 194,955 benchmark questions against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of AI capabilities and propensities to identify evaluation gaps.

Result: Findings show current benchmarks overemphasize behavioral propensities (e.g., hallucination, bias), while neglecting critical capabilities tied to systemic risks (e.g., evading oversight, self-replication), some receiving nearly zero coverage.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant gaps in AI evaluation ecosystems and urges refinement of regulatory tools like the EU AI Act's Code of Practice to address systemic risks more comprehensively.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using a small, general-purpose LLM to generate ERC datasets, improving ERC classifier models' performances and addressing data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC data is scarce and suffers from biased sources and subjective labels. LLMs, though promising, are costly and underutilized for ERC, especially in dataset generation.

Method: The paper leverages a resource-efficient LLM to generate six new ERC datasets, tailored to enhance existing benchmarks, and evaluates their effectiveness in ERC classification and label imbalance analysis.

Result: The generated datasets improved classifier robustness and significantly boosted performance on existing ERC benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using a small LLM for dataset synthesis is an effective approach to address data limitations and improve ERC model performance.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes InfiAlign, a scalable and data-efficient post-training framework to enhance reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). By using principled data selection and integrating SFT with DPO, the approach achieves competitive performance while reducing data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs post-training is resource-intensive, and existing methods lack scalability due to heuristic or task-specific data selection strategies.

Method: InfiAlign integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and uses a robust data selection pipeline to curate high-quality alignment datasets optimal for reasoning tasks.

Result: Applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, InfiAlign matched the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B with just 12% of the training data, improving by 3.89% on AIME benchmarks and exhibiting strong task generalization.

Conclusion: InfiAlign effectively aligns large reasoning models by combining scalable, principled data selection and efficient post-training methodologies. The framework demonstrates promising gains in reasoning tasks with reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Method: Proposed a two-stage training process within the GRAIL framework that combines LLM-guided exploration, path filtering, and process-supervised rewards for graph-based reasoning.

Result: GRAIL achieved notable improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 21.01% and F1 improvement of 22.43% on three question-answering datasets.

Conclusion: GRAIL effectively enhances graph-based reasoning precision and conciseness, significantly improving question-answering performance in knowledge graph tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

### [29] [Auto-Eval Judge: Towards a General Agentic Framework for Task Completion Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05508)
*Roshita Bhonsle,Rishav Dutta,Sneha Vavilapalli,Harsh Seth,Abubakarr Jaye,Yapei Chang,Mukund Rungta,Emmanuel Aboah Boateng,Sadid Hasan,Ehi Nosakhare,Soundar Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular framework for evaluating task completion by agents, which validates intermediate reasoning steps, improving alignment with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for agent decision-making either ignore intermediate reasoning or are limited to specific domains, creating a need for a more generalizable evaluation framework.

Method: The authors propose a modular approach that decomposes tasks into subtasks and validates each step using agent outputs and reasoning, aggregating module results for an evaluation verdict.

Result: Their framework was tested on the Magentic-One Actor Agent using two benchmarks, GAIA and BigCodeBench, and achieved 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy with human evaluations compared to the GPT-4o baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the evaluation of task completion by agents, showing better alignment with human assessments and generalizability across domains.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LORI, an AI tool leveraging NLP and RoBERTa/LLAMA models to evaluate leadership attributes in recommendation letters for STEM master's applicants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recommendation letters provide valuable insight into candidates’ skills, manually reviewing them is labor-intensive, prompting the need for automated solutions.

Method: The study uses large language models like RoBERTa and LLAMA, applying natural language processing techniques to extract leadership-related attributes such as teamwork, communication, and innovation from LORs.

Result: The RoBERTa model demonstrated strong performance with metrics such as a weighted F1 score of 91.6%, precision of 92.4%, and recall of 91.6%, showcasing high accuracy on test data.

Conclusion: Integrating LORI into graduate admissions could not only streamline evaluation processes but also provide a more thorough assessment of leadership skills, aiding in holistic candidate evaluation.

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MV-Debate, a framework combining multiple agents to analyze multimodal harmful content like sarcasm or hate speech, achieving better detection results compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in detecting harmful content on social media, where multimodal signals interact to create subtle meanings that are hard to interpret using conventional methods.

Method: MV-Debate employs four complementary debate agents: surface analyst, deep reasoner, modality contrast, and social contextualist, to iteratively analyze multimodal content and refine outputs using a reflection-gain criterion.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show MV-Debate outperforms existing single-model and multi-agent baselines in harmful content detection tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate frameworks like MV-Debate offer a promising approach for improving the detection of complex harmful intents in multimodal social media contexts.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

### [32] [The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619)
*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper advocates using Active Inference (AIF) to create autonomous AI systems that learn from experience without extensive human reward engineering, addressing key scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current AI paradigm struggles with scalability due to its dependence on curated training data and human-designed reward systems, hindering progress toward autonomous intelligence.

Method: The authors propose using Active Inference (AIF), which replaces external rewards with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, enabling adaptive and exploratory behavior. This is combined with Large Language Models for efficient learning and decision-making.

Result: The integration of AIF and generative world models forms a framework for AI agents capable of autonomous learning while maintaining alignment with human values and constraints.

Conclusion: AIF can bridge the grounded-agency gap, offering a pathway to scalable, autonomous, and aligned AI systems by shifting away from externally engineered rewards to self-driven learning.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

*Yu Yuan,Lili Zhao,Wei Chen,Guangting Zheng,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LearnerAgent, a framework using Large Language Models to simulate human learning dynamics, revealing insights into learning behaviors and patterns over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like controlled experiments and rule-based models struggle to capture dynamic learning progress, making it difficult to study human-like learning behaviors.

Method: LearnerAgent simulates a teaching environment by creating psychologically-inspired learner profiles (Deep, Surface, Lazy) and a General Learner, and tracks their knowledge acquisition, strategy decisions, tests, and interactions over a year.

Result: Deep Learner demonstrated sustained growth, Surface Learner was diagnosed with shallow knowledge using trap questions, self-concept scores evolved realistically across learners, and base LLM showed a diligent but limited understanding resembling a Surface Learner.

Conclusion: LearnerAgent provides realistic insights into human-like learning trajectories and reveals that base Large Language Models tend to mimic behaviors of diligent but shallow learners, aiding explainability and tracking of cognitive growth.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

### [34] [Understanding and Mitigating Errors of LLM-Generated RTL Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05266)
*Jiazheng Zhang,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper identifies major errors in LLM-based RTL code generation as stemming from limited domain knowledge, ambiguous descriptions, and multimodal misinterpretations. It introduces targeted solutions such as a domain-specific knowledge base, design rules, input conversion tools, and iterative debugging, achieving a 91% accuracy on a benchmark, 32.7% higher than the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unsatisfactory success rate of LLM-based RTL code generation by identifying and rectifying its key failure sources to improve performance.

Method: The authors analyzed errors in LLM-generated RTL code, categorized them, and introduced targeted solutions. These included a domain-specific knowledge base with retrieval-augmented generation, rule-checking mechanisms for design clarity, external tools for compatible input formats, and an iterative debugging loop.

Result: The enhanced LLM-based RTL code generation framework achieved a benchmark accuracy of 91%, an improvement of 32.7% over the baseline, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: A comprehensive error analysis and targeted interventions significantly improved the performance of LLM-based RTL code generation, making it a more viable tool for circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces relOBI, a reliable extension to the Open Bus Interface for SoCs, improving fault tolerance using TMR and ECC with moderate overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft errors in SoC interconnects in radiation-heavy environments can lead to total system failure, necessitating reliable interconnect designs.

Method: The authors propose relOBI by combining triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical handshake signals and error correction codes (ECC) for other signals. A fully reliable crossbar implementation was used for validation.

Result: Reliability improved from 34.85% vulnerability to 0% in fault injection tests. Area overhead increased by 2.6x while timing impact rose by 1.4x, with the approach showing 1.8x lower area overhead compared to fine-grained triplication.

Conclusion: The relOBI design enhances interconnect reliability significantly with manageable area and timing trade-offs, outperforming fine-grained redundancy approaches.

Abstract: On-chip communication is a critical element of modern systems-on-chip (SoCs),
allowing processor cores to interact with memory and peripherals. Interconnects
require special care in radiation-heavy environments, as any soft error within
the SoC interconnect is likely to cause a functional failure of the whole SoC.
This work proposes relOBI, an extension to Open Bus Interface (OBI) combining
triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical handshake signals with error
correction codes (ECC) protection on other signals for complete reliability.
Implementing and testing a fully reliable crossbar shows improved reliability
to injected faults from a vulnerability of 34.85 % to 0 % compared to a
reference design, with an area increase of 2.6x and 1.4x timing impact. The
area overhead is 1.8x lower than that reported in the literature for
fine-grained triplication and voting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates enriching transcribed dialogues through metadata tagging (e.g., age, gender, emotion) using frozen audio foundation models and a frozen LLAMA language model, maintaining modularity and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue transcription pipelines generally use LLMs for post-processing purposes like grammar correction. The paper explores adding metadata tags to enhance comprehension of speaker characteristics.

Method: Frozen audio foundation models and a frozen LLAMA language model are coupled with lightweight connectors to bridge audio and language representations for speaker profiling tasks. No fine-tuning of either model is required.

Result: Competitive performance in speaker profiling, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances dialogue transcriptions with metadata tags efficiently, while maintaining speed and modularity.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to achieve equitable tokenization across languages by adjusting for biases favoring high-resource languages in traditional tokenization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization methods inherently favor dominant languages, leading to inefficiencies and inequalities for lower-resource languages, both in tokenization quality and computational resource distribution.

Method: The authors propose a modified BPE algorithm where each merge step prioritizes improving the compression of the least compressed language, aiming for balance across languages rather than global efficiency alone.

Result: Parity-aware BPE achieves more balanced tokenization across languages with minimal impact on overall compression and no major negative effects on downstream language model performance.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE mitigates tokenization inequalities in multilingual contexts, offering a fairer approach without sacrificing overall system effectiveness.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores improving ASR systems by integrating a pitch accent detection module for joint training, significantly enhancing ASR and pitch accent detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compensate for limitations in current ASR systems by incorporating prosodic cues like pitch accents, thereby enhancing the understanding of natural speech.

Method: The authors propose a joint training model combining ASR and pitch accent detection. They leverage semi-supervised pretrained speech representations for fine-tuning the ASR model in conjunction with pitch accent detection.

Result: The pitch accent detection module achieves a 41% improvement in F1-score over the previous state-of-the-art, while the ASR model reduces Word Error Rate (WER) by 28.3% on LibriSpeech during limited-resource fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Integrating pitch accent detection with ASR enhances performance significantly in both tasks, highlighting the importance of prosodic features in speech processing models.

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the behavioral consistency of large language models (LLMs), finding that even large-scale models exhibit significant variability in responses, challenging assumptions about their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to examine whether large language models can exhibit stable personality-like behaviors, given the importance of behavioral consistency in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors develop an evaluation framework called PERSIST, testing 25+ models ranging from 1B to 671B parameters using traditional and novel personality measurement instruments, while systematically varying prompts and reasoning contexts.

Result: Findings reveal response variability, with even 400B+ models showing significant shifts in personality measurements based on minor prompt changes or interventions like chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: Current large language models lack foundations for true behavioral consistency, limiting the effectiveness of personality-based alignment strategies in safety-sensitive deployments.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCR-Router, a routing framework for multi-agent LLMs that reduces token usage while maintaining or improving answer quality, addressing inefficiencies in static routing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM systems face inefficiencies such as high token usage and limited adaptability due to static routing schemes. This paper aims to optimize collaboration efficiency and scalability in these systems.

Method: The authors propose RCR-Router, a role-aware routing framework that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets using a scoring policy, adhering to token budgets. Agent outputs are iteratively refined in a shared memory store.

Result: RCR-Router reduces token usage by up to 30% while maintaining or improving answer quality in HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured memory routing and focused evaluation metrics like the proposed Answer Quality Score are crucial in improving the efficiency and scalability of multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dynamic Group Attention (DGA) to optimize attention computations in large language models by reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context modeling in LLMs suffers from computational inefficiencies due to redundant attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors reformulate sequence modeling as supervised learning, analyze attention sparsity, and propose a group coding strategy, leading to the development of DGA for attention optimization.

Result: Dynamic Group Attention significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining performance, validated through empirical results.

Conclusion: The approach improves computational efficiency in LLMs without compromising their effectiveness.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group
coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens
during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate demographic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing linguistic shibboleths and measuring discriminatory patterns in AI evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to uncover and address demographic biases embedded in LLMs' automated evaluation systems, particularly on subtle linguistic markers like hedging.

Method: Creation of a benchmark with 100 validated question-response pairs containing controlled linguistic variations to analyze demographic biases using interview simulations.

Result: Demonstrated that hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and the benchmark effectively identifies model-specific biases across linguistic dimensions.

Conclusion: This benchmark is a foundational tool for detecting linguistic discrimination, aiding fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [43] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluating activity recognition models is difficult because verb ambiguities exist. This paper introduces a clustering framework for better evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods don't consider verb ambiguities and diverse perspectives in activity recognition, leading to partial model assessment.

Method: Develop a vision-language clustering framework to group synonymous verbs and evaluate models based on these clusters.

Result: Analysis shows 2.8 sense clusters per image in the imSitu dataset and demonstrates that cluster-based evaluations align better with human judgments.

Conclusion: Cluster-based evaluation is more robust and human-aligned than traditional exact-match methods for visual activity recognition.

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stage large language model framework for accurately and transparently extracting social determinants of health (SDoH) related to suicide incidents from text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in using data-driven approaches to identify social determinants of health factors associated with suicide incidents, such as long-tailed factor distributions and limited model explainability.

Method: A multi-stage large language model framework compared with state-of-the-art models like BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo. The framework also includes evaluations through automated comparisons and a pilot user study to measure accuracy and annotation efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated improved performance for overall SDoH factor extraction, context retrieval, and provided better explainability. Its fine-tuned smaller models offered comparable accuracy with lower inference costs.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both the accuracy and transparency of extracting SDoH factors, which could help in early risk identification and more effective suicide prevention interventions.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [45] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model for extracting sentiment quadruples from dialogues, addressing challenges in handling semantically independent sub-dialogues and proposing partitioning and extraction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to sentiment quadruple extraction in dialogues often assume uniform distributions of sentiment elements, leading to noise due to the presence of semantically independent sub-dialogues.

Method: The authors propose partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using a structural entropy minimization algorithm. They also introduce a two-step framework: sentiment element extraction at the utterance level and quadruple matching at the sub-dialogue level.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in extracting sentiment quadruples while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Partitioning dialogues and separating irrelevant utterances enhances quadruple extraction, aligning computational efficiency with improved accuracy.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates decoder-only LLMs for AMR parsing and finds that finetuning models like LLaMA 3.2 achieves competitive performance against SOTA parsers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether straightforward finetuning of decoder-only Large Language Models can serve as viable alternatives to complex SOTA AMR parsers.

Method: The study finetunes and evaluates four LLM architectures (Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled) on the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 dataset.

Result: LLaMA 3.2 achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804, comparable to existing SOTA parsers. Phi 3.5 excelled in structural validity, while LLaMA 3.2 led in semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: Decoder-only LLMs, when finetuned, can rival complex AMR parsers, making them a promising lightweight alternative.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [47] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Align-LoRA, a simplified method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models for multi-task learning, demonstrating that robust shared representations are key rather than task-specific isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large language models efficiently for multi-task learning is challenging, especially given the prevailing assumption that task-specific knowledge requires structurally diverse systems.

Method: The paper critiques multi-adapter and multi-head systems, proposing a single-adapter LoRA with increased rank and Align-LoRA with an explicit loss for aligning task representations in the shared adapter space.

Result: Experiments show that Align-LoRA outperforms all baseline methods in multi-task learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Align-LoRA offers a simpler and more effective alternative to existing paradigms for adapting large language models, emphasizing robust shared representation learning over task-specific feature isolation.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

*Aditya Kishore,Gaurav Kumar,Jasabanta Patro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MultiCheck,' a framework for verifying multimodal claims using both text and image reasoning, showing notable improvements in fact-checking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges posed by increasing multimodal misinformation, especially in claims supported by both text and images, which traditional fact-checking systems struggle with.

Method: The method incorporates dedicated encoders for processing text and images, a fusion module for cross-modal relationships via element-wise interactions, and a classification head with a contrastive learning objective to align claim-evidence pairs in latent space.

Result: The framework was tested on the Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that explicit multimodal reasoning enhances fact-checking capabilities and suggest that 'MultiCheck' could be scalable and interpretable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [49] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents BEE-RAG, a framework for improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by addressing issues caused by long contexts and entropy growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges caused by unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems utilizing long context lengths.

Method: The authors propose the BEE-RAG framework, which employs entropy invariance principles to stabilize attention sensitivity. It introduces a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and an adaptive fine-tuning mechanism for better control over context length effects.

Result: The proposed BEE-RAG framework was validated through extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in improving performance.

Conclusion: BEE-RAG effectively mitigates issues arising from long context lengths in RAG systems by leveraging entropy-engineered mechanisms and achieves better adaptability and performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

### [50] [Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05128)
*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how positional bias in input affects Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance, introducing a method called Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank) to mitigate such biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional sensitivity of LLMs often leads to suboptimal performance, motivating the study of mechanisms behind this bias and solutions to improve attention allocation for better outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce AttnRank, a two-stage framework that first calibrates a model’s positional attention preferences using a small dataset and then reorders content to align salient information with high-attention positions.

Result: AttnRank showed significant improvements on multi-hop QA and few-shot learning tasks across 10 diverse LLMs, without requiring model retraining or parameter modification.

Conclusion: AttnRank effectively enhances LLM performance by leveraging insights from attention bias; it is a simple, plug-and-play solution with wide applicability and minimal overhead.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrinciplismQA, a benchmark for assessing the ethical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, highlighting the existing limitations of LLMs in applying ethical principles realistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate LLMs' alignment with core medical ethics, despite growing integration into healthcare.

Method: The study created PrinciplismQA with 3,648 questions, comprising multiple-choice and open-ended questions rooted in authoritative texts and validated by medical experts.

Result: Experiments show LLMs struggle to practically apply ethical principles, particularly Beneficence, with closed-source models performing better overall. Medical domain fine-tuning helps improve ethical competence.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA provides a scalable approach to diagnose ethical shortcomings, enabling the development of better-aligned and responsible medical AI systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MulCoT-RD, a lightweight model designed for multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification in resource-limited environments. It achieves strong performance and interpretability using distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis rely on resource-intensive large language models, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a distillation framework using a "Teacher-Assistant-Student" paradigm. A high-performance model generates initial reasoning data, which is then used to train a medium-sized assistant, followed by a lightweight student model for both sentiment reasoning and classification.

Result: MulCoT-RD, with only 3 billion parameters, performs effectively on the JMSRC task across four datasets, demonstrating robust generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD represents a powerful solution for multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification in resource-constrained environments, bridging advanced performance with efficiency.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured pruning method that identifies and preserves functional networks and key neurons in large language models (LLMs) to improve pruning efficiency and maintain functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured pruning methods for LLMs often neglect the interaction and collaboration among neurons, which are critical for LLM functionality. This neglect leads to disrupted macro architectures and reduced pruning performance, warranting a more informed pruning approach.

Method: The paper introduces a method inspired by functional neural networks in the human brain. It treats an LLM as a digital brain, decomposing it into functional networks. Pruning is then performed by preserving key neurons within these identified networks.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively identify functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, resulting in efficient model pruning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of incorporating functional network identification into structured pruning, addressing limitations of existing approaches and providing a promising route for enhancing LLM efficiency.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeBoost enhances code large language models (LLMs) using a scalable approach relying solely on abundant code snippets rather than costly manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating and scaling the training of code LLMs is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale, high-quality, manually annotated instructions.

Method: CodeBoost introduces a framework with five components: maximum-clique curation, bi-directional prediction, error-aware prediction, heterogeneous augmentation, and heterogeneous rewarding to utilize unannotated code snippets effectively.

Result: CodeBoost showed consistent performance improvements across multiple code LLMs and benchmarks, validating its capability as an effective post-training approach.

Conclusion: CodeBoost removes the dependency on labor-intensive manual annotations and presents an efficient, scalable pipeline to enhance code LLMs using only abundantly available code snippets.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [56] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method addressing errors in reasoning chains by prioritizing late-stage errors and correcting them adaptively, demonstrating better accuracy than standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of fragile reasoning chains within existing CoT prompting methods for Large Language Models, specifically analyzing the impact of late-stage errors on final outcomes.

Method: The authors propose Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT), a pipeline combining an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) with a Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). AVM identifies late-stage errors using positional impact scoring, while MSCE applies targeted correction.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks GSM8K and MATH show ASCoT achieves superior accuracy, outperforming standard CoT baselines and addressing late-stage reasoning vulnerabilities effectively.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes diagnosing specific failure modes in reasoning chains and advocates adaptive correction mechanisms over uniform approaches in improving the reliability of LLM reasoning processes.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of dialogue agents, trained with synthetic data generated via large language models (LLMs), to assist meta-reviewers in the peer-review process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The peer-review process requires effective meta-reviewing wherein papers are evaluated based on reviewer arguments within broader contexts. This complicated decision-making task can benefit from dialogue agents tailored to assist.

Method: The authors address data scarcity by generating synthetic dialogue data using LLMs enhanced with self-refinement techniques. They train dialogue agents with this data and evaluate their performance against general-purpose LLM-based agents.

Result: The dialogue agents, trained on synthesized data, outperform off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants and are further validated through real-world meta-reviewing tests, showing improved meta-reviewing efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the promise of dialogue agents in facilitating meta-reviewing, confirming the potential of synthetic data generation techniques to improve expert task-oriented AI applications.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

TL;DR: SONAR-LLM is a decoder-only transformer trained in the SONAR embedding space, combining semantic abstraction and token-level supervision for competitive text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the Large Concept Model (LCM) by removing diffusion samplers while preserving semantic abstraction.

Method: Introduced SONAR-LLM which uses token-level cross-entropy supervision via a frozen SONAR decoder in the SONAR embedding space.

Result: SONAR-LLM achieves competitive text generation quality across model sizes (39M to 1.3B parameters).

Conclusion: The hybrid training objective balances semantic abstraction and likelihood-based training, showing promise for future research and reproducibility.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

### [59] [Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05337)
*Jiameng Huang,Baijiong Lin,Guhao Feng,Jierun Chen,Di He,Lu Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS) addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) by dynamically suppressing redundant reasoning triggers without affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the overthinking issue in LRLMs caused by excessive reflection behaviors, which increase token usage, inference costs, and reduce practical utility.

Method: CGRS dynamically suppresses the generation of reflection triggers in a model when high confidence in current responses is detected, preventing unnecessary reflection cycles. It is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with existing autoregressive generation systems without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Result: Extensive experiments on four reasoning benchmarks show CGRS reduces token usage by 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines consistently across architectures and scales.

Conclusion: CGRS significantly improves efficiency in LRLMs by reducing unnecessary reasoning steps, striking an optimal balance between token usage and performance, and demonstrating scalability across diverse models and sizes.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

*Fenya Wasserroth,Eleftherios Avramidis,Vera Czehmann,Tanja Kojic,Fabrizio Nunnari,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluated the impact of adjustability on a sign language avatar using the Microsoft Hololens 2, finding no significant improvements in UX or comprehensibility, but highlighting broader usability and animation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether adding adjustability features to sign language avatars on AR devices can improve user experience, comprehensibility, and acceptability.

Method: Expert German Sign Language users interacted with adjustable and non-adjustable avatars to evaluate factors like UX, comprehensibility, usability, and stress levels.

Result: Adjustable settings were preferred conceptually, but UX and comprehensibility remained poor due to missing SL elements (e.g., facial expressions), unclear gestures, and poor implementations.

Conclusion: Adjustability alone cannot address broader limitations of SL avatars; improvements in default comprehensibility, animation, interface usability, and participatory design are critical.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional search tasks, focusing on their self-feedback mechanisms to refine outputs in the context of the BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in applying autonomous LLM-based search systems to domain-specific tasks like biomedical research, which demand both expert involvement and transparency.

Method: The paper evaluates various LLMs (e.g., Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, etc.) using a self-feedback mechanism where the models iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine outputs for specific query types.

Result: Initial findings reveal mixed results for the models' self-feedback approach across different tasks, suggesting varying effectiveness in output improvement.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLM self-correction and sets the stage for comparing automated feedback mechanisms with human expert input for professional search systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MyCulture, a benchmark focused on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on Malaysian cultural contexts in six key areas using open-ended multiple-choice questions in Bahasa Melayu, aiming to address biases in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the cultural biases in LLMs trained predominantly on high-resource languages like English and Chinese, making it challenging to represent diverse cultural contexts, especially in low-resource settings like Malaysia.

Method: The method involves creating the MyCulture benchmark with open-ended multiple-choice questions in six cultural domains of Malaysia, theoretical justification of this format, comparative analysis of structured vs free-form outputs, and multilingual prompt assessments.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates significant disparities in cultural comprehension among regional and international LLMs, underlining the limitations of current models in low-resource cultural settings.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks like MyCulture are essential for the fair development and assessment of LLMs to better reflect diverse cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Motivation: Address limitations in static benchmark evaluations for LLMs, especially data contamination and overfitting on leaderboards.

Method: Introduces a proprietary question bank, contamination-resistant curation, anti-cheating mechanisms, and calibrated LLM-as-a-judge to ensure dynamic evaluation.

Result: Long-term study on 50 models identified performance ceilings in knowledge memorization and contamination vulnerabilities that static benchmarks fail to detect.

Conclusion: Dynamic evaluation via LLMEval-3 provides robust and credible assessments of LLM capabilities, advocating for improved evaluation standards.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with token-level understanding and structural reasoning, which are critical for precision and tasks requiring control. The authors aim to address this gap by providing a framework to evaluate and improve these capabilities.

Method: TASE benchmark includes a 35,927-instance evaluation set, 10 tasks in token awareness and structural understanding, a synthetic data generation pipeline, and evaluations of 30+ LLMs. A custom model (Qwen2.5-14B) was trained using the GRPO method.

Result: The findings highlight that human performance still surpasses current LLMs significantly in token-level reasoning. TASE provides evidence of persistent weaknesses in these models.

Conclusion: TASE serves as a diagnostic tool to identify and address foundational issues in token-level understanding and cross-lingual generalization of LLMs, paving the path for advancements in this domain.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: To evaluate and address the limitations of existing creativity measurement frameworks across different domains.

Method: Systematic analysis and comparison of creativity metrics, including creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: Findings show inconsistency among metrics due to differing creativity dimensions and highlight specific weaknesses in each metric.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for more robust evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a paradigm to enhance LLMs by decomposing complex questions into sub-questions for systematic reasoning and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with hallucinations and accuracy in knowledge-intensive tasks, and existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques lack structured logical reasoning.

Method: The method decomposes complex queries into logically dependent sub-questions, resolves them stepwise, integrates prior answers for context-aware retrieval, and includes a termination mechanism for error prevention.

Result: LAG outperforms on four benchmark datasets, reducing hallucinations and improving reasoning reliability in aligning with human cognition.

Conclusion: LAG offers a robust and principled improvement over RAG systems by enhancing the reasoning and systematic problem-solving abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines implicit geographic and cultural biases in LLMs using a multi-turn reasoning setup, specifically the "20 Questions" game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite efforts to mitigate explicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), subtle implicit biases persist due to pre-training data.

Method: The "20 Questions" game was employed as a testbed to evaluate geographic entity deduction disparities in LLMs using a new dataset (Geo20Q+), across configurations and languages.

Result: Findings show significant disparities in LLM performance, favoring entities from the Global North/West over the Global South/East, with minimal influence from gameplay language.

Conclusion: Creative multi-turn evaluation, as opposed to standard prompting, highlights underlying cultural biases, enabling deeper analysis of LLM reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCoLex, a decoding strategy for legal text generation designed to enhance fidelity to context by encouraging dynamic copying based on model confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in legal text generation due to unfaithfulness and hallucination, despite their potential in processing complex contexts.

Method: CoCoLex dynamically interpolates the vocabulary distribution with one based on copying from the context, guided by model confidence.

Result: Experiments conducted on five legal benchmarks show CoCoLex surpasses prior context-aware decoding methods, especially in long-form generation.

Conclusion: CoCoLex improves context integration and fidelity in legal text generation tasks, providing a promising solution for LLM use in the legal domain.

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method using conformal prediction to improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), surpassing logit-based methods in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliability of LLMs, including issues like hallucination and overconfidence, hinders their wider use in high-risk areas. The authors aim to develop a robust uncertainty quantification method to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose a frequency-based method under black-box settings that uses conformal prediction. It involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output, with the most frequent response used to calculate predictive entropy (PE).

Result: Experimental evaluations on six LLMs and four datasets demonstrated that the frequency-based PE method outperformed traditional logit-based methods in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions while effectively controlling miscoverage rates.

Conclusion: The frequency-based framework is a reliable, model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification in MCQA, offering guaranteed coverage and enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether multilingual large language models (MLLMs) reflect differences in political opinions across languages, finding that opinions are largely consistent across languages and alignment actions produce uniform results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding potential cross-lingual differences in the political responses of MLLMs and how their alignment can impact multilingual consistency.

Method: Surveys MLLMs' agreement or disagreement with political statements in five Western languages, and evaluates opinion shifts under political alignment using direct preference optimization with English alignment data.

Result: Unaligned MLLMs exhibit only slight opinion differences across languages, and political alignment causes nearly uniform opinion changes across all languages.

Conclusion: Political opinions transfer across languages in MLLMs for the studied contexts, complicating explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment strategies.

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

### [72] [MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05592)
*Shaoxiong Zhan,Yanlin Lai,Ziyu Lu,Dahua Lin,Ziqing Yang,Fei Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathSmith is a framework for generating challenging math problems to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of high-quality, high-difficulty training data hampers the advancement of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

Method: MathSmith generates new mathematical problems by sampling concept-explanation pairs, using predefined strategies, reinforcement learning, and rationale length to optimize complexity and difficulty.

Result: MathSmith outperformed existing baselines across multiple benchmarks, including both easy and hard problem sets, in short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings.

Conclusion: High-difficulty synthetic data, such as that generated by MathSmith, can significantly enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs, offering scalability and targeted improvement opportunities.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### [73] [Cooper: Co-Optimizing Policy and Reward Models in Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05613)
*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooper, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that co-optimizes both the policy and reward models to enhance reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs), overcoming issues related to traditional reward paradigms like rule-based and model-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward paradigms in RL (rule-based and model-based rewards) face significant limitations. Rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based ones are susceptible to reward hacking. A more reliable and dynamic reward system is needed to enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Method: The proposed framework, Cooper, dynamically co-optimizes the policy and reward models. It combines rule-based reward precision and introduces dynamic sample pairs for training the reward model. It incorporates a hybrid annotation strategy to generate data and introduces a reference-based reward model named VerifyRM.

Result: VerifyRM shows higher accuracy on the VerifyBench, and the Cooper framework demonstrates improved RL performance, mitigating reward hacking. For instance, it delivers a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Conclusion: Cooper provides an effective way to address reward hacking issues by dynamically updating the reward model, making it a robust approach to enhancing RL performance for reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

### [74] [OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614)
*Zixuan Wang,Dingming Li,Hongxing Li,Shuo Chen,Yuchen Yan,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEAR is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate language models' embodied reasoning abilities in complex environments. It highlights their limitations in physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assess language models' capabilities for embodied reasoning in tasks involving physical interactions and multi-agent coordination beyond abstract reasoning.

Method: OmniEAR uses a text-based environment representing 1,500 scenarios with dynamic physical properties, requiring models to reason without predefined tools or directives.

Result: Models perform well with explicit guidance (85-96%) but struggle under constrained reasoning (56-85%) or implicit collaboration (63-85%), showing limitations in embodied reasoning. Fine-tuning helps single-agent tasks but has minimal impact on multi-agent tasks.

Conclusion: Current language models face significant challenges in embodied reasoning, and OmniEAR acts as a benchmark for further research in advancing AI systems for these tasks.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

### [75] [Learning to Reason for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05618)
*Xilun Chen,Ilia Kulikov,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz,Rulin Shao,Gargi Ghosh,Jason Weston,Wen-tau Yih*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of hallucinations in reasoning large language models (R-LLMs) by proposing a novel reward function for online reinforcement learning to improve factual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R-LLMs perform well in complex reasoning but have a significant issue with factuality—generating hallucinations when tested against long-form factual benchmarks.

Method: The researchers designed a new reward function that evaluates factual precision, detail level, and relevance, and uses online RL to train models to improve factual reasoning.

Result: The model showed a 23.1 percentage point decrease in hallucinations, a 23% increase in detail level, and maintained response helpfulness across six factuality benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach improves the factual reasoning of R-LLMs by reducing hallucinations, enhancing detail, and preserving helpfulness in responses, tackling the challenges in long-form factuality settings.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

### [76] [How Do LLMs Persuade? Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05625)
*Brandon Jaipersaud,David Krueger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores persuasion dynamics in multi-turn conversations using linear probes, showcasing their ability to analyze and outperform some prompting-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how large language models persuade humans and the dynamics underlying these interactions.

Method: Linear probes were employed to study aspects of persuasion like success, personality, and strategy, informed by cognitive science and applied to multi-turn conversations.

Result: Probes effectively capture persuasion dynamics and outperform prompting methods in certain tasks, such as identifying strategies and pinpointing persuasive moments.

Conclusion: Linear probes offer a robust, efficient tool for analyzing complex behaviors like persuasion, deception, and manipulation in large-scale datasets and multi-turn conversations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak,Samira Ghodratnama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-NET++, a hierarchical, dynamic-chunking language model designed to address challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs) by using linguistically-informed segmentation. It outperforms existing methods across metrics like compression, robustness, and morphological boundary recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from computational inefficiencies and fragility in byte-level models for morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where tokenizers struggle with long words spanning many bytes.

Method: The paper proposes H-NET++, a language model incorporating a lightweight Transformer context-mixer for cross-chunk attention, latent hyper-prior for better document-level consistency, specialized treatment of orthographic artifacts, and a curriculum-based training strategy.

Result: H-NET++ showed better performance than GPT-2-fa on Persian corpora, achieving 12% better compression, improved robustness to orthographic corruption, and strong alignment with linguistic morphology.

Conclusion: H-NET++ provides an efficient and tokenizer-free solution for morphologically-rich languages, achieving state-of-the-art performance while addressing computational challenges.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetinexDual, a novel framework for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR) that combines spatial and frequency domain techniques to overcome shortcomings in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UHD IR methods either lose critical information (downsampling) or fail to properly address localized artifacts (frequency-domain approaches). The study aims to address these issues by combining Retinex theory with advanced network designs.

Method: RetinexDual consists of two sub-networks: SAMBA for refining reflectance via coarse-to-fine mechanisms, and FIA for correcting color and illumination distortions in the frequency domain.

Result: RetinexDual demonstrates superior performance compared to recent methods across four UHD IR tasks, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Ablation studies highlight the framework's design choices and component effectiveness.

Conclusion: The RetinexDual framework successfully addresses limitations of existing UHD IR methods, offering improved restoration performance and a generalized methodology applicable to diverse tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: Introduces ENTRep, a benchmark for the analysis of endoscopic images in ENT care, with multilingual annotations, classification, and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve automated analysis and case retrieval for ENT care, addressing current limitations in variability, subtleties, and fine-grained distinctions.

Method: Created ENTRep with annotated endoscopic images, bilingual descriptions, and benchmark tasks for classification and retrieval. Used test splits with server-side scoring.

Result: Evaluation of public/private test splits and summary of top team performances, contributing to ENT analysis tools.

Conclusion: ENTRep advances ENT care by standardizing benchmarks and enabling fine-grained, bilingual analysis of endoscopic images.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD integrates knowledge from state-of-the-art Vision Transformers into a compact student network for efficient self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods produce large, impractical models by working in isolation, overlooking potential complementary strengths.

Method: CoMAD uses asymmetric masking, teacher-student alignment, and a consensus gating mechanism to distill knowledge from multiple pretrained Vision Transformer models.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD achieves 75.4% Top-1 accuracy, while outperforming on dense-prediction tasks like ADE20K and MS-COCO in compact SSL distillation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMAD demonstrates that unifying multi-model insights through lightweight distillation can create resource-efficient architectures without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RADAR, an efficient, attention-based diffusion model for anomaly detection, which produces anomaly maps directly, eliminating prior issues tied to reconstruction in diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for anomaly detection suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracies in reconstructing subtle patterns, and require application-specific intermediate noise settings.

Method: RADAR uses attention-based diffusion models to directly produce anomaly maps without reconstructing input images, speeding up detection and improving accuracy.

Result: RADAR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, improving F1 scores by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on 3D-printed material datasets.

Conclusion: The RADAR framework resolves major inefficiencies in diffusion-based anomaly detection and delivers superior performance with better detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

TL;DR: This study investigates cost-effective eye movement tracking using event cameras, focusing on deep learning, specifically CNN-LSTM models, to predict human attention with 81% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an interpretable and cost-effective solution for eye tracking to improve VR/AR product functionality and user comfort.

Method: Utilized deep learning methods, particularly CNN-LSTM models, to analyze data from event cameras for eye center position prediction.

Result: Achieved approximately 81% accuracy in predicting eye center position using the CNN-LSTM model.

Conclusion: The research validates CNN-LSTM's efficacy in eye movement tracking and proposes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for future performance enhancements.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

TL;DR: LuKAN introduces a method to predict future 3D human poses effectively using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Lucas polynomial activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion forecasting.

Method: Use discrete wavelet transforms to encode motion sequences, spatial projection layers for structural consistency, and Lucas polynomial-parameterized layers for efficient function approximation.

Result: LuKAN achieves competitive results on three benchmark datasets with high efficiency and robust oscillation handling.

Conclusion: LuKAN balances accuracy with efficiency, demonstrating its value as a compact and effective solution for 3D human motion prediction.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces robust denoising diffusion models for anomaly segmentation in cases where only contaminated, unlabeled data is available, achieving significant performance improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve success in anomaly segmentation but traditionally assume availability of normal data, which limits applicability to realistic settings.

Method: The authors reinterpret diffusion models as nonlinear regression problems using robust regression, creating robust versions of denoising diffusion probabilistic models for contaminated data.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models, achieving up to 8.08% higher AUROC and 10.37% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

Conclusion: The novel robust denoising diffusion framework expands applicability of diffusion models to scenarios with contaminated data, proving their effectiveness in unsupervised anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VER-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to perform fine-grained visual reasoning by identifying subtle visual clues and integrating them with world knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately measure MLLMs' ability for deep reasoning, particularly in interpreting subtle image details that are crucial for robust visual analysis.

Method: The authors developed VER-Bench, a benchmark of 374 structured questions spanning various reasoning domains, paired with evidence (visual clues and reasoning) to test and evaluate MLLMs.

Result: VER-Bench showcases that current models struggle with extracting subtle visual evidence and performing intricate reasoning, highlighting their limitations in visual understanding.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of advancing MLLMs to enhance their abilities in fine-grained evidence extraction, integration, and reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMM, a framework for improving object detection by leveraging multi-modal queries and dual-stream attention to boost efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based object detectors face issues with occlusions, localization, and computational inefficiency.

Method: DAMM uses three types of queries (appearance-based, positional, and random learned) and introduces a dual-stream cross-attention module to refine features for better localization.

Result: DAMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in average precision (AP) and recall across challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention effectively enhance the accuracy and localization of transformer-based object detection models.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [87] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of label noise in multimodal hateful video detection by isolating explicitly hateful segments and analyzing the impact of coarse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the label noise and improve the detection accuracy caused by coarse, video-level annotations in hateful content, as these often obscure fine-grained temporal details.

Method: The researchers trimmed hateful videos from datasets like HateMM using timestamps, analyzed the characteristics of hateful vs. non-hateful segments, and conducted experiments to analyze the impact of temporal noise on classification.

Result: The study found that timestamp noise distorts model decision boundaries, weakens classification confidence, and demonstrates the time-dependency and continuity of hate speech expression.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the value of temporally-aware models and benchmarks to enhance robustness and interpretability in detecting hateful content.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing video highlight detection models fail to adapt to individual test videos, compromising performance. Highlight-TTA addresses this by dynamically adapting during testing for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video highlight detection methods lack adaptability to the unique characteristics of unseen test videos, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The paper introduces Highlight-TTA, a test-time adaptation framework that uses an auxiliary task (cross-modality hallucinations) alongside the primary highlight detection task, optimizing them in a meta-auxiliary training scheme.

Result: Highlight-TTA significantly improves video highlight detection performance across three state-of-the-art models and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamically adapting models during testing offers a promising approach to overcome generalization limitations in video highlight detection.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [89] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to extend monocular depth estimation models from perspective images to fisheye images by aligning their latent embeddings, enabling effective reuse without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimators trained on perspective images often fail on fisheye images due to covariate shifts caused by changes in camera calibration parameters.

Method: The method introduces Calibration Tokens to modulate the latent embeddings of fisheye images, aligning them with perspective embeddings, avoiding retraining or finetuning of foundational monocular depth estimators.

Result: The proposed approach improves depth estimation performance on fisheye images across various scenarios, outperforming existing recalibration methods using a single set of tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised technique successfully adapts monocular depth estimators for fisheye images, leveraging perspective image datasets by enforcing consistency during training without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper describes a highly effective feedforward artificial neural network achieving 98.3% accuracy on the ImageNet 2012 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy in image classification using a large-scale dataset through advanced neural network methods.

Method: Developed a feedforward artificial neural network using a new method and trained it on the ImageNet 2012 dataset, with detailed use of 322,430,160 parameters.

Result: Achieved 98.3% accuracy and a 99.69% Top-1 rate on the dataset, with an average of 285.9 perfectly classified labels per batch.

Conclusion: The model's sub-100% accuracy may stem from double-labeling issues in the dataset, highlighting dataset quality's impact on performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM integrates masked image modeling into vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance adaptive prompt learning, improving generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt learning techniques often overfit to known categories and lack generalization to unseen ones, requiring a scalable solution.

Method: ProMIM uses a masking strategy for visible image patches to create robust, instance-specific prompts that enhance existing methods like CoOp without architecture changes.

Result: ProMIM notably improves generalization in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks with minimal additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM is a practical and lightweight framework for enhancing VLMs, addressing overfitting and boosting performance on new tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRKT, a method for enhancing object and relationship detection in videos, addressing weaknesses in external object detectors through relation-aware and motion-aware techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate annotation challenges in Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) for video frames, particularly in the face of inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals caused by existing external object detectors.

Method: The proposed TRKT method utilizes relation-aware knowledge mining with category-specific attention maps and an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation strategy leveraging optical flow to enhance motion-aware detection. Additionally, a Dual-stream Fusion Module refines object localization by incorporating these attention maps into external detections.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset, presenting significant improvements over existing methods in Weakly Supervised DSGG.

Conclusion: TRKT addresses key limitations in Weakly Supervised DSGG by improving object detection in dynamic scenarios, advancing relation-aware and motion-aware methodologies while demonstrating effectiveness in video-based scene graph generation.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO introduces a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning approach to address domain shift in visual representations, applied effectively to multiplex immunofluorescence imaging in lung cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard SSL methods in handling domain shifts, which is a critical issue in biomedical imaging due to batch effects that obscure biological signals.

Method: The paper proposes AdvDINO, incorporating a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 framework to foster domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments were conducted on multiplex immunofluorescence lung cancer data.

Result: The model outperformed non-adversarial baselines, reducing biases, identifying biologically meaningful phenotype clusters with prognostic value, and enhancing survival prediction.

Conclusion: AdvDINO demonstrates improved robustness and interpretability in biomedical imaging and has potential applications across various imaging domains with domain shift challenges.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop system improving point cloud segmentation tasks with sparse human guidance, achieving high performance for base and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-world segmentation methods require heavy offline learning or extensive annotations, limiting their real-world usability.

Method: HOW-Seg creates class prototypes directly on query data, employs human annotations for segmentation, utilizes hierarchical refinement, and applies dense CRF optimization.

Result: HOW-Seg attains top-tier results in segmentation benchmarks, surpassing alternatives, particularly with advanced setups and increased annotation density.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg represents a significant practical advancement in segmentation, leveraging minimal human input for efficient and accurate segmentation across base and novel classes.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis by introducing adaptive weighting and learned uncertainties, leading to superior rendering quality, especially in sparse-view scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of overfitting in 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, particularly in scenarios with sparse-view sampling.

Method: The paper proposes learned uncertainties that influence adaptive Gaussian opacity adjustments while preserving the pipeline. Additionally, it uses soft differentiable dropout regularization to convert uncertainties into drop probabilities, improving the rendering process.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved rendering quality and outperform existing sparse-view methods, achieving 3.27% PSNR improvements on specific datasets, such as MipNeRF 360.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting strategy and learned uncertainty framework developed by the authors significantly improve the rendering quality in sparse-view scenarios, offering efficiency with fewer Gaussians.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the canvas-based attention scheduling method for edge device perception systems, optimizing performance and resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time high-resolution object detection needs optimization to handle latency and limited computation resources effectively on edge platforms.

Method: The paper proposes variable-size canvas frames and adjustable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved trade-offs, achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements advance the quality and efficiency of perception systems on resource-constrained edge platforms.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

*Zheng Chen,Mingde Zhou,Jinpei Guo,Jiale Yuan,Yifei Ji,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SODEC, a single-step diffusion model for image compression, addressing decoding latency and fidelity issues found in traditional methods, while achieving faster speed and improved visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image compression methods have high decoding latency due to multi-step sampling and poor fidelity influenced by generative priors.

Method: SODEC utilizes a pre-trained VAE to produce informative latents, incorporates a fidelity guidance module for improved quality, and applies a rate annealing strategy for low-bitrate performance, replacing multi-step refinement with single-step decoding.

Result: SODEC significantly enhances rate-distortion-perception performance and improves decoding speed by over 20 times compared to prior diffusion-based compression models.

Conclusion: SODEC offers a practical solution for image compression with better perceptual quality, fidelity, and speed, setting a new benchmark for diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a depth completion method leveraging foundation models to achieve robust performance without large-scale training, using techniques like dual-space propagation and a learnable correction module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in depth completion, which traditionally relies on limited and carefully curated data.

Method: The framework integrates environmental cues using depth foundation models with RGB images, utilizes dual-space propagation (3D and 2D) for sparse depth propagation, and employs a learnable correction module for refinement.

Result: The proposed model was trained on NYUv2 and KITTI datasets and evaluated on 16 additional datasets, showcasing remarkable performance in OOD scenarios and surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates enhanced robustness and accuracy in depth completion through innovative techniques, promoting practical application in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified modality separation framework to improve performance in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) by disentangling modality-specific and modality-invariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing vision-language models in unsupervised domain adaptation, where the modality gap between vision and text reduces performance.

Method: The proposed method disentangles modality-specific and modality-invariant components from vision-language model (VLM) features, handles them separately, and combines them using modality-adaptive ensemble weights. A modality discrepancy metric is introduced to categorize samples and optimize cross-modal alignment.

Result: The method achieves up to 9% performance improvement and is 9 times more computationally efficient, as demonstrated across multiple datasets, backbones, and adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The study provides an effective approach to leverage both modality-specific and modality-invariant features, overcoming the modality gap and advancing UDA performance with pre-trained VLMs.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

TL;DR: This paper explores how familiarity training enhances global context sensitivity in a Vision Transformer-based autoencoder using LoRA-based fast weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how familiarity training impacts neural representation, specifically in the early layers of deep networks, drawing a parallel with the rapid learning observed in the human visual cortex.

Method: A Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods are used to simulate transient memory traces and test familiarity-induced changes in self-attention mechanisms.

Result: The study highlights (1) manifold transformations mimicking neural circuit behavior, (2) alignment of latent representations between layers, (3) increased self-attention scope in familiar contexts, and (4) amplification of effects by LoRA-based fast weights.

Conclusion: Familiarity training introduces global context sensitivity to early network layers, offering insights into brain-like rapid learning mechanisms and supporting hybrid fast-and-slow weight architectures for computational modeling.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

### [101] [Attribute Guidance With Inherent Pseudo-label For Occluded Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04998)
*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of person re-identification (Re-ID) in occluded environments by proposing AG-ReID, a framework that enhances feature extraction using a dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of pre-trained vision-language models in occluded Re-ID scenarios, which fail to extract fine-grained attribute information critical for distinguishing partially visible individuals or those with subtle differences.

Method: The proposed AG-ReID framework operates in two stages: generating attribute pseudo-labels to capture subtle visual characteristics, and utilizing a dual-guidance mechanism to combine holistic and fine-grained attribute information for improved image feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple Re-ID datasets, particularly excelling in handling occlusions and subtle differences, while remaining competitive in standard Re-ID scenarios.

Conclusion: AG-ReID effectively addresses the challenges of occlusion and fine-grained distinction in Re-ID tasks, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models without requiring additional data or annotations.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

### [102] [CRAM: Large-scale Video Continual Learning with Bootstrapped Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05001)
*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM), a method for continual learning in video classification with limited memory requirements by using compressed video embeddings instead of raw video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable continual learning for neural networks in video settings, addressing high memory demands and natural distribution shifts in streaming environments, similar to how biological systems learn.

Method: The proposed method, CRAM, compresses video inputs into embeddings that are stored in a memory buffer. It deals with the challenge of catastrophic forgetting during online training by refreshing video codes through decompression and recompression steps.

Result: CRAM shows superior performance compared to existing methods by reducing memory usage (storing thousands of lengthy videos in under 2 GB) and demonstrating better efficacy on video classification benchmarks like EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700.

Conclusion: CRAM successfully mitigates the memory and forgetting issues in video continual learning, providing a scalable solution that improves upon prior approaches with reduced storage requirements.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

*Xusheng Liang,Lihua Zhou,Nianxin Li,Miao Xu,Ziyang Song,Dong Yi,Jinlin Wu,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework called Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning (MCDRL) to improve domain generalization in medical image segmentation by integrating causal inference with Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of applying Vision-Language Models, like CLIP, to medical imaging tasks, which suffer from domain shifts caused by variability such as differences in equipment and imaging modes.

Method: The MCDRL framework operates in two steps: 1) utilizing CLIP to identify lesion regions and create a confounder dictionary via text prompts, and 2) training a causal intervention network to mitigate domain-specific variations while retaining anatomical structures for segmentation.

Result: The proposed MCDRL method consistently outperforms other techniques in segmentation accuracy and demonstrates robust generalizability across unseen domains.

Conclusion: MCDRL effectively addresses domain generalization issues, showing its potential for advancing segmentation tasks in medical imaging by leveraging causal inference with VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

*Shushi Wang,Chunyi Li,Zicheng Zhang,Han Zhou,Wei Dong,Jun Chen,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in quality assessment for AI-enhanced user-generated content (AI-UGC) by introducing AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset of 4,800 AI-UGC images and analyzing the effectiveness of existing assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of specialized perceptual quality assessment models for AI-enhanced user-generated content (AI-UGC) has hindered user experience and the development of enhancement methods.

Method: The researchers created AU-IQA, a dataset of 4,800 AI-UGC images produced by three enhancement types—super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. They used this dataset to test traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models.

Result: Comprehensive analysis of the performance of current quality assessment approaches in evaluating the perceptual quality of AI-UGC is provided.

Conclusion: The study highlights the lack of effective quality assessment methods for AI-UGC, introduces a benchmark dataset, and provides an evaluation framework to inspire further advancements.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces skin-SOAP, a multimodal framework for automatically generating structured SOAP notes using minimal inputs like lesion images and sparse text, aimed to assist clinicians in diagnosing and documenting skin carcinoma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high prevalence of skin carcinoma and the challenges clinicians face in manually documenting SOAP notes during patient visits, like labor-intensive processes contributing to burnout.

Method: It proposes the skin-SOAP framework leveraging weak supervision and multimodal inputs, including lesion images and limited clinical text, to generate SOAP notes while incorporating novel metrics for validation.

Result: The framework demonstrated comparable performance to advanced models like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, validated using newly introduced metrics that assess medical semantic alignment and coherence.

Conclusion: Skin-SOAP provides a scalable solution to alleviate clinician workload by enabling automated SOAP note generation while maintaining clinical relevance and reducing dependency on large datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

### [106] [A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05037)
*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a training-free metric designed to evaluate scene composition structure preservation in images generated by AI, addressing limitations in existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models require evaluation methods to ensure accurate preservation of scene composition structure, which traditional metrics inadequately assess.

Method: The SCSSIM metric uses statistical measures based on the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, avoiding neural-network-based training.

Result: SCSSIM is highly invariant to non-compositional distortions and accurately detects compositional changes, outperforming existing metrics in structural evaluation.

Conclusion: SCSSIM offers a reliable, robust measure for assessing structural fidelity in generative AI outputs, facilitating model development focused on scene composition integrity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

*Yiyang Su,Yunping Shi,Feng Liu,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework enhances video-based person re-identification with +13.0% accuracy on benchmarks like MEVID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods fail to effectively select and use discriminative features from query-gallery pairs, necessitating a more adaptive and robust approach.

Method: The proposed HAMoBE framework utilizes multi-layer features from pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) to model key biometric features like appearance, body shape, and gait. A dual-input decision gating network dynamically adjusts expert contributions.

Result: HAMoBE achieves significant performance gains, including a +13.0% improvement in Rank-1 accuracy on video-based ReID benchmarks such as MEVID.

Conclusion: HAMoBE’s hierarchical and adaptive design effectively integrates discriminative biometric features, advancing the state-of-the-art in video-based person re-identification.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the NiM benchmark to test MLLMs' ability to locate fine-grained details in documents and proposes Spot-IT, a method that significantly improves MLLMs' precision in such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze and improve multi-modal large language models' ability to locate and reason about small, crucial details in complex documents.

Method: NiM benchmark was developed to test real-world document understanding, supplemented by Spot-IT, which uses intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention for enhanced precision.

Result: Spot-IT demonstrated significant improvements over baseline models in detail-oriented tasks and showcased existing MLLMs' strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: Spot-IT aids MLLMs in addressing limitations in fine-grained document comprehension tasks and improves document search and reasoning processes.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

TL;DR: DualMat is a dual-path diffusion framework for estimating PBR materials from images, improving prediction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of PBR materials from single images under complex lighting is challenging and essential for realistic rendering tasks.

Method: DualMat uses an albedo-optimized path in RGB latent space, a material-specialized path in compact latent space, feature distillation, rectified flow, patch-based estimation, and cross-view attention.

Result: DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 28% better albedo estimation and 39% lower metallic-roughness prediction errors on Objaverse and real-world data.

Conclusion: DualMat effectively enhances material estimation quality, efficiency, and compatibility with multi-view integration for image-to-3D pipelines.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DecoupleCSS, a novel method for continual semantic segmentation by decoupling detection and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting in continual semantic segmentation, a challenge in learning new classes while retaining old ones.

Method: The proposed method uses a two-stage framework: (1) class-aware detection leveraging LoRA-adapted pre-trained encoders for prompts, and (2) class-agnostic segmentation using the SAM model.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing improved retention-adaptability balance in multiple challenging tasks.

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS effectively handles continual learning, enabling robust semantic segmentation across both old and new classes.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, addressing its ill-posed nature by leveraging scene semantics and training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective methods for image colorization, which is a challenging task due to the loss of two image dimensions, while utilizing semantic cues from scenes for better predictions.

Method: The authors explore automatic image colorization through methods like classification and adversarial learning, building on prior work and applying specific modifications to suit their scenario.

Result: The authors compare the performance of their modified approaches and analyze their effectiveness in solving the colorization problem.

Conclusion: Automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning holds promise due to its ability to incorporate semantic and contextual cues for more accurate predictions in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FLUX-Makeup, a makeup transfer framework that eliminates the need for auxiliary face-control components and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current makeup transfer methods often rely on auxiliary components like loss functions or face-control modules, which can introduce errors and lead to suboptimal results.

Method: The proposed FLUX-Makeup framework uses source-reference image pairs directly, incorporates a RefLoRAInjector module for efficient makeup feature extraction, and employs a new data generation pipeline for better training supervision.

Result: FLUX-Makeup demonstrates high-fidelity transfer, identity consistency, and strong robustness in numerous scenarios, performing better than existing methods.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust makeup transfer solution without auxiliary components, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaFusion, a method for dynamically combining Pathology Foundation Models to improve performance and interpretability in histopathology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) have strong capabilities but suffer from biases and lack generalizability in downstream tasks, creating a need for better integration and interpretability methods.

Method: AdaFusion uses prompt-guided inference that compresses and aligns features from different PFMs and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse these features based on tissue phenotype context.

Result: AdaFusion outperforms individual PFMs in tasks like treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference across benchmarks, while providing interpretable insights into model specialization.

Conclusion: AdaFusion effectively integrates knowledge from heterogeneous PFMs, enhancing both model performance and interpretability for histopathology applications.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen is a framework for generating unlimited-duration videos from a reference image and pose sequence, addressing identity drift and motion control issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with generating long, coherent videos while preserving subject identity and fine motion control.

Method: PoseGen applies in-context LoRA finetuning for identity preservation and pose conditioning, combined with interleaved segment generation and stitching.

Result: Experiments show PoseGen outperforms other methods on identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and producing coherent, extended videos.

Conclusion: PoseGen advances video generation by overcoming temporal and structural limits, enabling unlimited-duration, controlled, and artifact-free videos.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

### [115] [Sculpting Margin Penalty: Intra-Task Adapter Merging and Classifier Calibration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05094)
*Liang Bai,Hong Song,Jinfu Li,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Tianyu Fu,Danni Ai,Deqiang Xiao,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMP, a novel approach for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, which addresses challenges like balancing base-class discrimination and new-class generalization through margin penalties in fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications in class-incremental learning face issues such as limited access to training data and unclear decision boundaries, requiring stronger solutions for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning.

Method: SMP integrates Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) and Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) in a fine-tuning paradigm, leveraging contrasting margin constraints to adapt models for forward-compatible learning.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 show SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and better balance between base and new class learning.

Conclusion: SMP successfully improves Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning by addressing performance degradation and decision boundary ambiguity, striking a balance between base and future class generalization.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

### [116] [AHDMIL: Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning for Fast and Accurate Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05114)
*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHDMIL proposes an efficient and accurate solution for pathological image classification by refining multi-instance learning approaches. It eliminates irrelevant image patches and improves classification and inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL faces challenges in processing thousands of patches from gigapixel WSIs, leading to high inference costs. The paper resolves this inefficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: AHDMIL employs a two-step training process: Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN) for high-resolution image analysis and DB-LIPN for low-resolution patch screening. Self-Distillation and Asymmetric Distillation steps are utilized alongside a novel Chebyshev-polynomial-based CKA classifier.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior classification performance and inference speed. On Camelyon16, AHDMIL improves accuracy by 5.3% and speeds up inference by 1.2 times, showcasing consistent gains across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets.

Conclusion: AHDMIL represents a robust framework for efficient pathological image classification, establishing superiority over existing methods in accuracy and speed. Code availability ensures reproducibility.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

### [117] [Latent Expression Generation for Referring Image Segmentation and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05123)
*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for visual grounding, addressing the gap between rich visual details and sparse textual descriptions by generating multiple latent expressions from a single input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the mismatch between the rich information in the visual domain and the limitations of a single textual cue, which often causes misidentification of similar objects.

Method: The framework employs subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to integrate shared and distinct visual attributes into latent representations, along with a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align these with the original text while preserving variations.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual grounding methods across benchmarks, including outstanding performance on the GRES benchmark.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances visual grounding tasks by capturing diverse visual cues, leading to improved localization and comprehension of target objects in images.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

### [118] [FedGIN: Federated Learning with Dynamic Global Intensity Non-linear Augmentation for Organ Segmentation using Multi-modal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05137)
*Sachin Dudda Nagaraju,Ashkan Moradi,Bendik Skarre Abrahamsen,Mattijs Elschot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedGIN is a Federated Learning framework designed for multimodal medical image segmentation, achieving significant improvements in segmentation performance while maintaining patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in generalizing medical image segmentation models to multiple imaging modalities due to data scarcity, modality differences, and privacy concerns, creating a need for a robust solution.

Method: FedGIN utilizes a Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific differences during local training, enabling federated learning across datasets without sharing raw data.

Result: In scenarios with limited data, FedGIN improved 3D Dice scores by 12–18%. For complete datasets, it achieved a 30% improvement over MRI-only baselines and 10% over CT-only baselines, demonstrating effective cross-modality generalization.

Conclusion: FedGIN offers a promising approach to multimodal organ segmentation under privacy constraints, achieving performance closer to centralized models while overcoming modality disparities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

*Yu-Hsi Chen,Wei-Hsin Chen,Chien-Yao Wang,Hong-Yuan Mark Liao,James C. Liao,Chien-Chang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an automated framework to analyze chronic pain behavior in mice, outperforming existing methods and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack precision and are limited by manual labeling and unclear behavioral markers of chronic pain in mice.

Method: The study utilizes a universal action space projector for feature extraction from video data and avoids human-defined biases in labeling. It includes a newly created mouse pain behavior dataset tracking disease progression.

Result: The proposed method achieved significant accuracy improvements in pain classification tasks, surpassing human experts and a widely used method, B-SOiD.

Conclusion: This automated framework provides enhanced accuracy and insights into pain research and drug efficacy, with potential applications in clinical studies and drug development.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

### [120] [Rotation Equivariant Arbitrary-scale Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05160)
*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) by embedding rotation equivariance into the network to mitigate artifacts and deformation in geometric patterns, proposing an end-to-end rotation-equivariant ASISR method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of geometric pattern deformation in low-resolution images during ASISR tasks, which results in artifacts in high-resolution outputs, by leveraging rotation equivariance.

Method: The authors redesign both the implicit neural representation (INR) and encoder modules to incorporate rotation equivariance, creating an end-to-end network that maintains rotational integrity from input to output. They also provide a theoretical framework analyzing the intrinsic equivariance error.

Result: The proposed ASISR method demonstrates superior performance on both simulated and real datasets and can enhance existing ASISR methods in a plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel rotation-equivariant ASISR network that effectively addresses the deformation of geometric patterns, achieving improved results across datasets while promoting easy integration into existing frameworks.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-MoGen introduces a unified model for generating text-driven human and animal motion using a two-stage architecture and a novel dataset (UniMo4D).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods typically focus separately on either human or animal motion, limiting their versatility and generalization.

Method: X-MoGen uses a two-stage model: (1) T-pose priors with a conditional graph variational autoencoder and a morphological loss regularized shared latent space, and (2) masked motion modeling using textual input.

Result: X-MoGen proves effective in generating plausible motions for both humans and animals, surpassing existing separate methods using experiments with the UniMo4D dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves unified cross-species text-driven motion generation, advancing the potential for applications in animation, robotics, and VR.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

*Qi Guo,Xiaojun Jia,Shanmin Pang,Simeng Qin,Lin Wang,Ju Jia,Yang Liu,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents PhysPatch, an adversarial patch framework targeting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving, to exploit vulnerabilities with improved transferability and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Multimodal Large Language Models in autonomous driving systems to adversarial attacks, especially when existing patch-based attacks perform poorly in these complex systems.

Method: PhysPatch framework optimizes patch location, shape, and content while introducing techniques like semantic-based mask initialization, SVD-based local alignment loss, and potential field-based mask refinement.

Result: PhysPatch significantly improves attack success rates and transferability across various MLLM models while placing patches in physically feasible locations for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysPatch framework demonstrates superior performance over existing methods and ensures its practical applicability in adversarial patch attacks on MLLM-based autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

*Zewei Wu,Longhao Wang,Cui Wang,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new tracking method called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) to handle unseen categories and challenging scenarios in multitarget tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multitarget tracking methods struggle with unseen categories, weak constraints, and prolonged occlusions in real-world scenarios.

Method: The Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) approach creates flexible tracklets by clustering detection results based on spatio-temporal factors. It uses multiple cues like location and appearance to associate and partition tracklets robustly.

Result: Experimental results on a generic multiple-object tracking benchmark show that MTT outperforms existing methods and is highly competitive.

Conclusion: MTT enhances multitarget tracking by mitigating challenges like error propagation and occlusions using its novel multi-tracklet association framework.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPA++, a new framework for domain adaptation (DA) that aligns domain graphs spectrally and improves target domain discriminability using graph-based methods and augmentation techniques, showing state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in domain adaptation, particularly the tradeoff between inter-domain transferability and intra-domain discriminability, which is often neglected.

Method: Develop a spectral alignment framework (SPA++) using graph alignment, neighbor-aware propagation, and regularization techniques to handle domain adaptation effectively.

Result: SPA++ achieves robust and superior performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods under various challenging settings.

Conclusion: A generalized graph-based DA framework like SPA++ can enhance adaptability and discriminability in the target domain, backed by theoretical insights and validated by experimental benchmarks.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEX, a multimodal vision-language model leveraging spectral information for land cover extraction in multispectral remote sensing imagery, which improves accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral information in remote sensing has been underutilized in vision-language models, resulting in weaker performance in multispectral tasks.

Method: The authors develop a vision-language dataset (SPIE) with spectral priors and propose SPEX, incorporating components like multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: SPEX consistently surpasses conventional methods in land cover extraction across five multispectral datasets, identifying categories like vegetation, buildings, and water bodies, with added textual explanations.

Conclusion: SPEX is the first model specifically tailored for spectral land cover extraction, combining accuracy with user-friendly interpretability.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

*Bingyu Yang,Qingyao Tian,Yimeng Geng,Huai Liao,Xinyan Huang,Jiebo Luo,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EndoMatcher, a novel method for dense feature matching in endoscopic images, addressing challenges like difficult visual conditions and data scarcity using Vision Transformer-based architecture and a newly constructed multi-domain dataset, Endo-Mix6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images to support robot-assisted tasks such as 3D reconstruction and surgical scene understanding, but challenges like weak textures, large viewpoint variations, and limited annotated data make this difficult.

Method: The researchers proposed EndoMatcher, which employs a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks for feature extraction and correspondence learning, alongside the creation of Endo-Mix6, a 1.2M image-pair multi-domain dataset. They also implemented a progressive multi-objective training strategy to handle dataset variations.

Result: EndoMatcher significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot matching, delivering a 140.69% and 201.43% increase in inlier matches on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets, respectively, and improving MDPA by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher demonstrates robust generalization capabilities in endoscopic image matching, leveraging innovative architectural design and diverse dataset construction to enable accurate zero-shot performance across challenging imaging conditions.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VFlowOpt, a framework for efficient visual token pruning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), achieving substantial memory and computational savings while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiencies caused by the redundancy of visual tokens in LMMs used for visual-language tasks, while minimizing the performance degradation typically observed in existing pruning frameworks.

Method: VFlowOpt introduces an importance map derived from attention and entropy for visual tokens, uses a progressive pruning module with token recycling to retain important information, and optimizes the pruning hyperparameters through a visual information flow-guided method to minimize discrepancies between LMMs with and without pruning.

Result: The framework can prune up to 90% of visual tokens, achieving an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory usage and offering 3.8 times faster inference speed while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt effectively addresses the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, providing a highly optimized token pruning strategy for LMMs that improves computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### [128] [Textual and Visual Guided Task Adaptation for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05213)
*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel source-free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) method utilizing textual and visual information for target domain task adaptation. It achieves significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the significant performance drop of Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) in scenarios with domain discrepancies. While existing methods rely on the availability of source domain data, privacy concerns and efficiency demands have driven the need for source-free approaches.

Method: The proposed method uses Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to adapt multi-level features from a pretrained backbone for the target task. It employs a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module for aligning features across different views and a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module to align cross-modal features using textual priors, creating refined segmentation outputs through fusion of module outputs.

Result: The approach achieves notable segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18% and 4.11% under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods across four datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed source-free CD-FSS method effectively addresses cross-domain segmentation challenges using a combination of visual and textual priors, providing improved accuracy while maintaining efficiency and respecting data privacy constraints.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a novel vision-language tracking framework using the pre-trained model Qwen2.5-VL to improve tracking accuracy by leveraging reasoning and language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language tracking methods struggle with inflexibility and limited performance due to insufficient reasoning processes and underuse of large pre-trained models.

Method: The framework employs reasoning-based text adaptation using SFT and GRPO optimization, embedding updated language descriptions in a tracking backbone with vision features, and introduces the TNLLT benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the reasoning-based language generation strategy, and 20 visual trackers are re-trained on the TNLLT dataset.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack significantly enhances vision-language tracking by integrating reasoning, large model advantages, and a comprehensive benchmark dataset, advancing the field.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

*Semanur Küçük,Cosimo Della Santina,Angeliki Laskari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of segmenting irregularly shaped gas bubbles in multiphase flows by leveraging modern vision foundation models. Fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model shows promising results in handling complex bubble structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gas bubble segmentation in multiphase flows is essential for various industrial applications, but existing methods are limited by assumptions of spherical bubble shapes, failing in scenarios with irregular bubble deformations, coalescence, or breakup.

Method: The study employs a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM v2.1) using a limited set of 100 annotated images to address the segmentation of complex bubble structures.

Result: The fine-tuned SAM v2.1 model effectively segments highly non-convex and irregular bubble structures, demonstrating its capability in handling topologically diverse patches.

Conclusion: Modern vision foundation models, specifically SAM v2.1, can be leveraged through transfer learning to overcome traditional limitations in bubble segmentation tasks, paving the way for improved performance in complex industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

*Yatong Lan,Jingfeng Chen,Yiru Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating camera images from arbitrary viewpoints in autonomous driving scenarios using self-supervised learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving benefits from arbitrary viewpoint image generation, but the lack of ground-truth data for extrapolated views has hindered progress in high-fidelity generative models.

Method: Arbiviewgen employs Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) for hierarchical matching of camera views and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL) for self-supervised training, leveraging diffusion models.

Result: The proposed framework achieves controllable camera image generation from arbitrary viewpoints using only multi-camera images and poses, without requiring additional sensors or depth maps.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen sets a new benchmark by addressing the lack of ground-truth data and offering a practical solution for arbitrary view generation in autonomous driving vehicles.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

*Zane Xu,Jason Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This report analyzes key approaches to boost zero-shot adversarial robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) and examines trade-offs in preserving generalization while enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for improving adversarial robustness in VLMs without compromising their zero-shot generalization capabilities, a critical aspect for broader applications.

Method: The report synthesizes insights from existing paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning, Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, alignment-preserving methods, embedding re-engineering, input heuristics, and latent-space purification.

Result: The analysis tracks progression from early alignment-focused approaches to advanced methods like embedding re-engineering and latent-space purification. Key challenges and future directions in hybrid defenses and adversarial pre-training are identified.

Conclusion: Effective adversarial robustness in VLMs requires trade-offs between generalization and robustness, with emerging hybrid strategies and pre-training standing out as promising pathways.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

*Tianchen Fang,Guiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in medical image understanding, introducing RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal learning approach, and MedRegion-500k, a medical image-text corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues like limited annotated medical data and reliance on global image features that miss localized pathological regions.

Method: Developed RegionMed-CLIP with an ROI processor and progressive training to align regional and global features using MedRegion-500k dataset.

Result: RegionMed-CLIP outperformed state-of-the-art models in tasks such as image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive pre-training is essential, making RegionMed-CLIP a strong framework for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines various methods for gender classification, mainly focusing on biometric features such as facial and iris traits, identifies gaps in current techniques, and provides insights for improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification has practical applications such as surveillance, profiling, and human-computer interaction, and identifying gaps can enhance these applications.

Method: The study reviews previous literature, compares different approaches, and analyzes methods for gender classification based on biometric traits like iris and facial features.

Result: Existing approaches are summarized, gaps and challenges in current methods are highlighted, and future research directions are suggested.

Conclusion: This research supports the development of more effective gender classification techniques and provides a roadmap for addressing current limitations in the field.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CF3, a novel top-down approach for constructing efficient 3D Gaussian feature fields by fusing multi-view 2D features, using per-Gaussian autoencoders and adaptive sparsification; achieving a compact representation with only 5% of the Gaussians compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs and improve the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by addressing the limitations of bottom-up optimization techniques.

Method: The method introduces a top-down pipeline involving weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features, training per-Gaussian autoencoders in the 3D domain, and employing adaptive sparsification to optimize and prune redundant Gaussian attributes.

Result: The proposed CF3 method achieves a compact and efficient 3D feature field representation, using only 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS, while preserving geometric details.

Conclusion: CF3 offers an effective alternative to conventional bottom-up approaches in constructing 3D Gaussian feature fields, balancing computational efficiency and high-quality feature representation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a particle filtering tracker to robustly track heart motion in fluorescent cardiac imaging, achieving real-time results with superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately tracking local feature points in fluorescent cardiac imaging is essential for estimating cardiac perfusion during surgery, but heart motion and image fluctuations challenge traditional methods.

Method: The authors propose a particle filtering tracker augmented with cyclic-consistency checks to robustly follow target landmarks in cardiac images, capable of tracking 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps.

Result: The proposed method achieves a tracking error of 5.00 ± 0.22 px, significantly outperforming deep learning trackers (22.3 ± 1.1 px) and traditional trackers (58.1 ± 27.1 px).

Conclusion: The method enables robust and accurate real-time tracking for intraoperative applications, surpassing the performance of existing trackers.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by SAM, for enhanced infrared and visible image fusion with high fidelity and semantic awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods struggle with preserving key targets, semantic understanding, and image quality due to artifacts and detail loss.

Method: SGDFuse employs high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as priors, using a two-stage process: preliminary multimodal feature fusion followed by semantic-guided coarse-to-fine denoising via a diffusion model.

Result: SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in subjective/objective evaluations and supports downstream tasks, significantly improving image fusion quality.

Conclusion: SGDFuse offers a robust, high-fidelity, and semantically-aware solution to address key challenges in IVIF, leveraging semantic masks and diffusion processes effectively.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Motivation: Dynamic outdoor environments require analyzing complex interactions and changes over time. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with 4D LiDAR data due to lack of annotations and suitable architectures.

Method: The authors developed B4DL, a benchmark, along with a scalable data generation pipeline and a novel MLLM model capable of directly processing raw 4D LiDAR data by connecting it with language understanding.

Result: The proposed benchmark and model provide a unified approach to spatio-temporal reasoning. Outputs include rendered 4D LiDAR videos, datasets, and inference results for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: B4DL and the associated model advance understanding of dynamic outdoor environments by enabling MLLMs to process high-dimensional 4D LiDAR data.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF), a remote sensing change detection method leveraging wavelet-domain feature modeling. The approach enhances edge detail perception and global semantic relationships to reduce edge ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for enhanced methods in remote sensing imagery change detection, particularly to overcome challenges in capturing subtle edge changes that are poorly modeled in the spatial domain.

Method: WGDF utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high-frequency and low-frequency components for detailed and structural feature modeling. It incorporates modules like Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE), Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID), and Progressive Contextual Difference Module (PCDM), along with Transformers for semantic understanding.

Result: WGDF demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for change detection tasks across multiple remote sensing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Combining wavelet-domain analysis with spatial-domain processing creates a superior framework for remote sensing change detection, enabling precise identification of subtle changes and robust performance in engineering applications.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a method using automated techniques and a Visual-Semantic LLM-based approach to analyze drawings for depression assessment, achieving a 17.6% improvement in accuracy over traditional psychologist assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychologists use the Drawing Projection Test (DPT), particularly PPAT sketches, to understand mental states such as depression. However, manual interpretation is labor-intensive and subjective.

Method: The authors propose an automated environment coupled with a Visual-Semantic depression assessment method using large language models (VS-LLM), focusing on sketch elements like color usage and spatial arrangement under constrained drawing conditions.

Result: Compared to traditional psychologist assessments, the proposed method improves evaluation accuracy by 17.6%, supporting large-scale automated DPT analysis.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining VS-LLM techniques and sketch analysis for enhanced mental state assessment, benefiting both scalability and precision in art therapy processes.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient smaller visual models often struggle with out-of-distribution data generalization. CoCAViT is introduced as a novel backbone solving these issues with the CoCA mechanism, showing robust performance gains across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to improve the generalization performance of smaller, efficient visual models, particularly on out-of-distribution datasets, where they significantly underperform compared to larger models.

Method: The method involves identifying architectural bottlenecks and design flaws in smaller visual models and introducing the Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism to enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptability across domains.

Result: The proposed CoCAViT model achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significant improvement in out-of-distribution benchmarks, along with competitive results on COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CoCAViT proves to be a robust and efficient visual backbone for real-time representation, addressing scalability and robustness issues in smaller models through innovative design.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

*Xu Yuan,Liangbo Ning,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the mKG-RAG framework, integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for improved Visual Question Answering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RAG-based VQA methods often introduce irrelevant or misleading content by relying on unstructured documents, negatively impacting answer accuracy and reliability.

Method: The framework uses keyword extraction and vision-text matching to construct structured multimodal knowledge graphs, along with a dual-stage retrieval strategy to improve precision and efficiency.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal knowledge graphs into RAG-based VQA frameworks enhances accuracy and reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

### [143] [MELLA: Bridging Linguistic Capability and Cultural Groundedness for Low-Resource Language MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05502)
*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies two critical goals for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-resource languages: linguistic capability and cultural groundedness. It introduces MELLA, a dataset designed to improve MLLMs by providing culturally-aware and linguistically-rich data. Experiments show performance improvements across eight languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages because current enhancement methods emphasize text modality and machine translation without cultural or multimodal informativeness.

Method: The authors propose a dual-source strategy using native web alt-text for cultural depth and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability, culminating in the creation of MELLA, a multimodal multilingual dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on MELLA leads to improved performance in eight languages, resulting in enhanced multimodal descriptions ("thick descriptions") and improvements in linguistic and cultural awareness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining linguistic and cultural data in MLLMs significantly enhances their performance for low-resource languages, offering a path forward for more inclusive AI models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

### [144] [Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323)
*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for improving object detection in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by extending their vocabulary using Textual Inversion (TI), enabling novel object detection with minimal examples and retaining original model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of finetuning large vision language models (VLMs) without losing their zero-shot capabilities, while improving their performance on specific targets.

Method: The paper proposes using Textual Inversion (TI) to learn new or refine existing tokens for object detection. This method works with minimal examples and keeps the original model weights frozen, reducing computation requirements compared to full-model finetuning.

Result: The proposed method retains original VLM zero-shot and natural language querying capabilities, extends vocabulary for novel detection tasks, and achieves comparable or superior performance to baseline methods without suffering from forgetting.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient and effective solution for enhancing VLMs' object detection capabilities while maintaining their inherent versatility and strong benchmark performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

### [145] [3DGabSplat: 3D Gabor Splatting for Frequency-adaptive Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05343)
*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat), a novel method for 3D radiance field representation and rendering using Gabor-based primitives, outperforming previous 3DGS approaches in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify limitations in the existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach, specifically its inability to capture high-frequency details efficiently and its issues with redundant primitives and memory overhead.

Method: The paper proposes 3DGabSplat, leveraging 3D Gabor-based primitives with multiple directional frequency responses. A CUDA-based rasterizer and frequency-adaptive optimization mechanism are developed to enhance rendering quality and efficiency.

Result: 3DGabSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering across real-world and synthetic scenes, with up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS, along with reduced primitives and memory consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed 3DGabSplat demonstrates significant quality and efficiency improvements, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for enhancing 3DGS paradigms in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

### [146] [PriorRG: Prior-Guided Contrastive Pre-training and Coarse-to-Fine Decoding for Chest X-ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05353)
*Kang Liu,Zhuoqi Ma,Zikang Fang,Yunan Li,Kun Xie,Qiguang Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PriorRG, a chest X-ray report generation framework leveraging patient-specific clinical context and prior imaging to improve diagnostic accuracy and report fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing chest X-ray report generation methods that neglect critical patient-specific prior information, such as clinical context and prior imagery, which radiologists rely on.

Method: A two-stage training process: Stage 1 with prior-guided contrastive pre-training for spatiotemporal feature alignment; Stage 2 with prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding to integrate patient-specific information for better report generation.

Result: PriorRG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in BLEU-4, F1 scores, and BLEU-1 on the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: PriorRG effectively incorporates patient-specific prior knowledge into chest X-ray report generation, improving the clinical relevance and quality of the reports while aligning more closely with radiologists' workflows.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### [147] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc enhances cross-view localization (CVL) by splitting ground-level images into slices for independent pose estimates, ensuring reliability and accuracy through redundant observations and stringent validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current CVL methods that provide only a single observation—the camera pose—making reliability assessment difficult due to insufficient redundant observations.

Method: Slice-Loc splits query images into sub-images to estimate independent 3-DoF poses for each section. It uses a geometric rigidity formula for filtering incorrect poses and a reliability model that quantifies localization accuracy through false alarm estimation.

Result: Slice-Loc significantly decreases localization errors. For example, it reduces mean localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and orientation error from 3.42° to 1.24° in cross-city tests, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc introduces a robust approach to CVL by leveraging redundant sub-image observations and error elimination techniques, thereby improving localization reliability and accuracy. Its advancements lead to better self-localization performance in GNSS-denied environments.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

*Hamza Kalisch,Fabian Hörst,Jens Kleesiek,Ken Herrmann,Constantin Seibold*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CT-GRAPH, a hierarchical graph attention network, for automating radiology report generation, leveraging organ-based anatomy modeling and pretrained encoders to achieve superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inadequacy of current radiology report generation methods, which rely on global image features but overlook fine-grained anatomical relationships critical for accurate reporting.

Method: CT-GRAPH is proposed to structure anatomical regions in a graph, connecting fine-grained organ features to coarser anatomical systems, combining pretrained 3D medical encoders and graph refinement integrated with a large language model.

Result: The method improves the F1 score by 7.9% compared to the state-of-the-art on the CT-RATE chest CT dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for radiology report generation.

Conclusion: By modeling radiological knowledge through hierarchical relationships in anatomical regions, CT-GRAPH enhances medical report generation and assists radiologists effectively in handling their workloads.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

*Luozheng Qin,Jia Gong,Yuqing Sun,Tianjiao Li,Mengping Yang,Xiaomeng Yang,Chao Qu,Zhiyu Tan,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-CoT proposes a unified framework for multimodal reasoning in vision-language tasks, enabling coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes using a single model for image understanding and generation. It achieves significant performance and scalability using a novel two-level reasoning paradigm and structured training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in extending Chain-of-Thought reasoning to vision-language tasks, particularly struggles in modeling visual state transitions and incoherent visual trajectories, which hinder effective multimodal reasoning.

Method: Uni-CoT employs a two-level reasoning paradigm: Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and Micro-Level CoT for detailed subtask execution. It also utilizes structured training with interleaved image-text supervision and multi-task objectives to enhance reasoning scalability and coherence.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like WISE, RISE, and KRIS reveal that Uni-CoT achieves SOTA performance in reasoning-driven image generation and editing tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is established as a leading solution for scalable, coherent, and efficient multi-modal reasoning using limited computational resources, showing promise in vision-language task advancements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

*Mingxi Fu,Xitong Ling,Yuxuan Chen,Jiawen Li,fanglei fu,Huaitian Yuan,Tian Guan,Yonghong He,Lianghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework with deformable attention to enhance pathology image analysis by dynamically accounting for spatial relationships among tissue patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology image analysis struggles to accurately capture spatial dependencies among tissue structures due to limitations in existing methods like Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and static graph topologies in GNNs.

Method: A dynamic weighted directed graph is built using patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information via attention-weighted edges aided by learnable spatial offsets derived from the actual spatial coordinates.

Result: The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification).

Conclusion: Incorporating deformable attention into GNNs enhances the ability to model complex spatial structures in pathology, offering improved classification accuracy for WSIs and ROIs.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

### [151] [Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for GUI Grounding via Region Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05615)
*Yong Du,Yuchen Yan,Fei Tang,Zhengxi Lu,Chang Zong,Weiming Lu,Shengpei Jiang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO, two innovative methods that improve the accuracy of GUI grounding tasks by leveraging consistency in model predictions during inference without requiring additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods rely heavily on expensive pixel-level annotations for training, which limits their scalability and efficiency. The authors aim to explore alternative approaches to improve GUI localization performance during inference without additional labeled data.

Method: The authors propose GUI-RC, a test-time scaling method that aggregates spatial voting grids from multiple predictions to identify consensus regions. They also introduce GUI-RCPO, which uses these consistency patterns as rewards for test-time reinforcement learning, allowing the model to refine its predictions iteratively on unlabeled data.

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on the ScreenSpot benchmarks without training, and GUI-RCPO further boosts accuracy. For instance, it raises Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct's accuracy from 80.11% to 85.14% on ScreenSpot-v2.

Conclusion: The methods showcase the effectiveness of test-time scaling and reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, highlighting their generality and potential to create more robust GUI agents with reduced dependency on labeled data.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

*Wonjun Kang,Byeongkeun Ahn,Minjae Lee,Kevin Galim,Seunghyuk Oh,Hyung Il Koo,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked Generative Transformers like UNCAGE focus on overcoming autoregressive limitations and improving text-to-image generation with compositional fidelity, leveraging attention maps for efficient decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional text-to-image (T2I) generation remains challenging due to issues with text-image binding accuracy in Diffusion Models and Masked Generative Transformers.

Method: Proposes UNCAGE, a training-free method using attention maps to prioritize unmasking for better representation of individual tokens during T2I generation.

Result: UNCAGE improves compositional fidelity and achieves better performance on multiple benchmarks, with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE addresses the limitations of Masked Generative Transformers in compositional T2I generation, offering a practical and efficient solution with consistent improvements.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

*Farah Wahida,M. A. P. Chamikara,Yashothara Shanmugarasa,Mohan Baruwal Chhetri,Thilina Ranbaduge,Ibrahim Khalil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueBiometric introduces a novel method to detect and correct poisoned images in biometric systems, achieving 100% accuracy without harming clean image performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in biometric systems to backdoor attacks, exploiting training process manipulations for unauthorized access.

Method: TrueBiometric utilizes a majority voting mechanism based on multiple large vision language models to detect poisoned images and applies corrective noise to fix them.

Result: Empirical tests show TrueBiometric achieves 100% detection and correction accuracy for poisoned images without affecting clean image accuracy.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric surpasses existing defenses in accuracy, practicality, and effectiveness against backdoor attacks, enhancing biometric system reliability.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

*Jiawei Liang,Siyuan Liang,Jianjie Huang,Chenxi Si,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of physical adversarial camouflage in deceiving object detectors, introducing a framework with gradient calibration and decorrelation strategies to significantly improve attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle security risks posed by physical adversarial camouflage, which can deceive object detectors used in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, especially under varying physical environments.

Method: The authors introduce a gradient optimization-based adversarial camouflage framework, which includes a gradient calibration strategy to ensure consistent updates across distances and a gradient decorrelation method to prioritize orthogonal gradient updates, enhancing multi-angle optimization stability.

Result: The proposed method improves attack success rates by 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles, outperforming the state of the art. Additionally, it demonstrates effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the challenges of inconsistent sampling and gradient conflicts, significantly improving adversarial attack success rates and highlighting the need for enhanced system robustness in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

### [155] [Smoothing Slot Attention Iterations and Recurrences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05417)
*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmoothSA to enhance Slot Attention (SA) in Object-Centric Learning (OCL) by addressing issues with cold-start queries in the first frame and homogeneous transformations across video frames, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in Slot Attention's handling of cold-start queries for the first frame of videos and homogeneous transformations across frames, which impede precise object aggregation.

Method: SmoothSA contains two innovations: preheating cold-start queries with input features using a self-distilled module for better initialization on the first frame, and differentiating transformations between first and non-first video frames by applying full iterations on the former and single iterations on the latter.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrated improvements in object discovery, recognition, and downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of SmoothSA.

Conclusion: SmoothSA successfully resolves limitations of Slot Attention by improving first-frame query initialization and frame-specific transformations, leading to smoother iterations and recurrences in Object-Centric Learning.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

*Hubert Baniecki,Maximilian Muschalik,Fabian Fumagalli,Barbara Hammer,Eyke Hüllermeier,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FIxLIP, a second-order explanation method for language-image pre-trained (LIP) models based on game theory, improving visualization of input pair interactions and outperforming first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing saliency maps in explaining LIP model outputs, which fail to capture complex cross-modal interactions.

Method: FIxLIP utilizes the weighted Banzhaf interaction index, rooted in game theory, to provide second-order explanations for LIP models and extends evaluation metrics like the pointing game and insertion/deletion curves.

Result: Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks demonstrate that FIxLIP achieves better explanation performance compared to first-order attribution methods.

Conclusion: FIxLIP delivers improved explanations for vision-language models, highlighting its potential utility in model comparisons and enhancing understanding of cross-modal interactions.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

### [157] [How and Why: Taming Flow Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05461)
*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Flow Matching (FM) method for unsupervised anomaly detection that addresses limitations in existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the restrictions in model expressivity of traditional flow-based methods for anomaly detection and provide a robust alternative.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) and proposes a new WT-Flow paradigm using Worst Transport displacement interpolation to differentiate between normal and anomalous data.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: The novel FM-based approach provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for anomaly detection, overcoming key limitations and offering robust performance.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

*Lumin Chen,Zhiying Wu,Tianye Lei,Xuexue Bai,Ming Feng,Yuxi Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhen Lei,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel dataset (PAS) and a segmentation approach (F2PASeg) for critical anatomical structures in pituitary surgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the scarcity of pixel-level annotated datasets for pituitary surgeries and to enhance surgical safety by accurately segmenting critical anatomical structures.

Method: The paper introduces the PAS dataset, containing 7,845 time-coherent images, and proposes a Feature Fusion module (F2PASeg) that combines high-resolution image features and semantic embeddings to improve segmentation robustness in dynamic conditions.

Result: Experimental results show that F2PASeg provides real-time and reliable segmentation of vital anatomical structures in pituitary surgeries.

Conclusion: The study contributes a robust solution (F2PASeg) to address intraoperative variations, enhancing safety and planning in pituitary surgery. Code is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

### [159] [Keep It Real: Challenges in Attacking Compression-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05489)
*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the role of lossy compression in defending against adversarial attacks, finding that models producing realistic image reconstructions are notably more resistant to strong adaptive attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether image preprocessing through lossy compression can effectively defend against adversarial perturbations and to assess the robustness of such defenses under strong attacks.

Method: The researchers constructed robust white-box and adaptive attacks to evaluate various lossy compression models. They assessed the role of realism in reconstructed images in enhancing or weakening defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.

Result: Lossy compression models that generate high-fidelity, realistic reconstructions showed significant resistance to strong adversarial attacks, while low-realism models were easily compromised. The robustness was linked to distributional alignment with natural images rather than gradient masking.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of realism in image reconstruction for adversarial robustness and identifies this as a challenging aspect for attackers to overcome, suggesting that future research should focus on further developing such defenses.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMOL-MapSeg, an advancement in the segmentation of historical maps using OND (On-Need Declarative) knowledge-based prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges posed by the inconsistency and variability of patterns in historical maps, which existing pre-trained models struggle with.

Method: The authors developed OND knowledge-based prompting, enhancing the foundation model SAM, and fine-tuned it to segment historical maps, creating SMOL-MapSeg.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg achieves high segmentation accuracy for user-defined and unseen classes, outperforming a UNet-based baseline.

Conclusion: OND knowledge-based prompting enables better handling of historical maps' challenges, making SMOL-MapSeg a robust solution for semantic segmentation in this domain.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a

*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised approach to extract chirality features from 2D models for application in shape analysis tasks like matching and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of chirality-aware features in existing shape analysis approaches, which fail to distinguish between left and right symmetric shapes.

Method: The authors build on the Diff3F framework to propose an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline that incorporates information from 2D foundation models to enhance shape descriptors.

Result: Experiments validate that the chirality features improve downstream tasks such as left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and segmentation across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively incorporates chirality-aware features in shape analysis tasks, demonstrating their utility and performance improvements in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MagicHOI, a method for hand-object reconstruction in monocular videos, overcoming limitations like partial object occlusion using novel view synthesis diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RGB-based hand-object reconstruction either rely on object templates or assume full object visibility, which fails in real-world scenarios with occlusions.

Method: MagicHOI uses a novel view synthesis diffusion model as supervision to regularize occluded regions and integrates visible contact constraints for better hand-object alignment in short monocular videos.

Result: MagicHOI significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in hand-object reconstruction, particularly in scenarios involving occluded object regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D hand-object reconstruction by leveraging novel view synthesis priors and visible contact constraints.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-supervised pre-training framework to enhance event data's information for tasks like object recognition through three key stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high-resolution and dynamic data but are challenged by sparsity and noise, limiting effective feature extraction.

Method: A three-stage framework: Difference-guided Masked Modeling for enhanced info extraction, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition for preserving learned representation, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning for semantic improvement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework robustly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks like object recognition and optical flow estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves latent feature utilization in event data, demonstrating superiority across diverse visual tasks.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced pedestrian tracking framework that addresses occlusion challenges using richer feature representations and improved motion modeling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian tracking systems encounter significant occlusion challenges in real-world applications, such as when multiple pedestrians overlap, rendering traditional methods inadequate for maintaining stable tracking.

Method: The method integrates features from the regression and classification branches of an object detector while including spatial and positional data. A head keypoint detection model is employed to mitigate occlusion, and an iterative Kalman filtering approach with 3D priors improves motion prediction.

Result: This method effectively addresses occlusion issues, providing more reliable tracking in crowded scenarios by leveraging enhanced feature and motion models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves multi-object tracking, particularly in crowded, occlusion-heavy environments, by incorporating advanced feature detection and robust motion forecasting techniques.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper introduces a certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models using randomized smoothing in feature space rather than input space, reducing inference time and maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance robustness in IQA models while preserving image fidelity and computational efficiency.

Method: Noise is applied in the feature space along with formal analysis connecting feature-space noise to input-space perturbations through the backbone network's Jacobian.

Result: Reduces inference time significantly (99.5% without certification and 20.6% with certification) while improving correlations with subjective quality scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully balances robustness, efficiency, fidelity, and model adaptability across extensively validated experiments.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a

demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad

*Shaowu Chen,Wei Ma,Binhua Huang,Qingyuan Wang,Guoxin Wang,Weize Sun,Lei Huang,Deepu John*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel structural pruning framework called Optimal Brain Connection, which uses a new Jacobian Criterion and an Equivalent Pruning mechanism to retain performance in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods fail to capture parameter interconnections adequately, which limits their effectiveness in compressing neural networks.

Method: The proposed framework introduces a first-order metric (Jacobian Criterion) for assessing structural parameters and an autoencoder-based Equivalent Pruning mechanism to preserve contributions of pruned connections.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the Jacobian Criterion outperforms popular metrics in maintaining model performance, while the Equivalent Pruning mechanism reduces degradation post fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves structural pruning by addressing parameter interconnections and achieves better post-fine-tuning performance preservation in neural networks.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

*Haoyu Liu,Chaoyu Gong,Mengke He,Jiate Li,Kai Han,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SSTGNN, a lightweight graph neural network for detecting AI-generated and manipulated videos with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of generative video models, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-manipulated content, especially since existing models struggle with diverse manipulation types and tend to be resource-intensive.

Method: The authors propose SSTGNN, a Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network that represents videos as structured graphs. It incorporates learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling to analyze spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that SSTGNN outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, while being highly robust to unseen manipulations. It achieves this with up to 42.4× fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SSTGNN is a scalable, lightweight, and effective solution for detecting AI-manipulated videos, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

*Adi Levi,Or Levi,Sardhendu Mishra,Jonathan Morra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the domain of brand safety in content moderation using a novel dataset, highlighting their effectiveness and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in moderating unsafe video content that traditional human reviewers find overwhelming, leveraging MLLMs for nuanced multimodal analysis.

Method: Introduce a new multimodal and multilingual dataset labeled by professionals, benchmark and compare MLLMs like Gemini, GPT, and Llama for brand safety classification, and analyze their performance and cost-effectiveness.

Result: MLLMs showed promising results in multimodal brand safety classification, but there are limitations and specific failure cases compared to human expertise.

Conclusion: MLLMs can play a role in multimodal content moderation but require further refinement. The release of the dataset aims to foster research and development in this field.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action Discovery, a new setup for Temporal Action Segmentation where only known actions are annotated, and others remain unlabeled, addressing ambiguous and incomplete annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in domains where only partial annotations exist, such as neuroscience and applications with ambiguous or missing labels.

Method: They propose a two-step approach: (1) Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) identifies both known and unknown action intervals, (2) Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) assigns semantic classes to unknown actions using embedding similarities.

Result: When evaluated on three datasets (Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly), the proposed method outperformed existing baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses partial annotations by segmenting and classifying unknown actions, advancing the field of Temporal Action Segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Follow-Your-Instruction," a framework for automatically synthesizing 2D, 3D, and 4D data using Multimodal Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by the high cost and time investment needed to collect large-scale real-world data for AI applications, as well as the limitations of current manual scene construction processes.

Method: The method involves using an MLLM-driven framework that includes: collecting assets via multimodal inputs, constructing 3D layouts, leveraging Vision-Language Models for refinement, and generating temporally coherent future frames.

Result: Experiments show that the synthetic data generated by this framework improves the performance of baseline models significantly in generative tasks involving 2D, 3D, and 4D data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence, addressing data limitations in AI-generated content.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

*Haijing Liu,Tao Pu,Hefeng Wu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DART framework for better object recognition, leveraging vision-language pre-training, adaptive feature refinement, and language-model-derived relational knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately recognizing multiple seen and unseen object categories in an image, where existing models struggle with precise object localization and relational knowledge transfer.

Method: The DART framework enhances a vision-language backbone with two adaptive modules: ARM for patch-level feature refinement and ATM for class representation transfer using graph attention and language-model-derived knowledge.

Result: DART achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition, showcasing its efficacy in localization and knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: DART effectively refines intra-class object localization and transfers inter-class knowledge, overcoming the limitations of existing models in open-vocabulary multi-label recognition tasks.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

### [174] [WeTok: Powerful Discrete Tokenization for High-Fidelity Visual Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05599)
*Shaobin Zhuang,Yiwei Guo,Canmiao Fu,Zhipeng Huang,Zeyue Tian,Ying Zhang,Chen Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeTok introduces two innovations to improve visual tokenization: Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ) for efficient and scalable codebooks, and Generative Decoding (GD) for probabilistically modeling visual data. It achieves superior reconstruction fidelity at high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers struggle with balancing high compression ratios and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. This paper seeks to address this limitation.

Method: The paper proposes WeTok, featuring GQ to partition latent features for lookup-free quantization, and GD to incorporate a generative decoder with noise variable modeling.

Result: WeTok achieves superior performance on benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet 50k) with record-low zero-shot rFID scores, surpassing FLUX-VAE and Cosmos in both fidelity and compression ratio.

Conclusion: WeTok offers a breakthrough in visual tokenization by improving scalability, reconstruction fidelity, and achieving high compression efficiency. Its innovations represent significant advancements in the field.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaVA-RE, a binary image-text relevancy evaluator leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for accurate assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating image-text relevancy is crucial for multimodal AI tasks, but existing approaches struggle with diverse text formats and varied definitions of relevancy across scenarios.

Method: The paper utilizes the LLaVA architecture, augmented with detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context examples, and develops a novel relevancy dataset.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in handling binary image-text relevancy evaluation.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE offers a promising solution for improving image-text relevancy evaluations, paving the way for better multimodal generative AI responses.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework for assessing 3D generative content quality, addressing limitations in existing methods by incorporating both object-level and part-level evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating 3D generated content quality primarily rely on image-based metrics, which fail to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and nuanced local details.

Method: Hi3DEval integrates hierarchical evaluations at both object and part levels and introduces Hi3DBench, a large-scale annotated dataset. It utilizes a multi-agent annotation pipeline and a 3D-aware automated scoring system leveraging video and pretrained 3D features.

Result: Experiments show Hi3DEval surpasses existing metrics in capturing 3D characteristics, aligns better with human preferences, and provides an effective alternative to manual evaluations.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval enhances 3D generative content evaluation by offering scalable, accurate, and human-aligned assessments that outperform traditional image-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 introduces a novel and more realistic dataset for video object segmentation, addressing challenges like occlusions, adverse weather, and camouflaged objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object segmentation (VOS) datasets rely on salient, isolated objects, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Develop a complex dataset (MOSEv2) with 5,024 diverse videos and high-quality masks, benchmark VOS and video object tracking methods on more intricate environments.

Result: Performance drops were observed in state-of-the-art methods: SAM2's accuracy fell from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to 50.9% on MOSEv2.

Conclusion: Current VOS techniques, despite excelling on standard datasets, struggle significantly under realistic, complex scenarios as evidenced by MOSEv2.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GAP, a method for transforming raw 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussian splats using text guidance, employing a multi-view optimization framework and leveraging advanced techniques for geometric accuracy and completing unseen regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between point clouds and 3D Gaussians is crucial for high-quality and efficient rendering, especially as point clouds are a widely accessible 3D representation. Existing methods struggle with generating Gaussians directly from raw, colorless point clouds.

Method: GAP utilizes a multi-view optimization framework guided by a depth-aware image diffusion model for consistent appearance synthesis. It includes a surface-anchoring mechanism to ensure geometric fidelity and a diffuse-based inpainting strategy to handle unseen regions.

Result: Experiments show that GAP effectively converts point clouds into 3D Gaussians across synthetic, real-world, and large-scale scanning scenarios, demonstrating adaptability and performance in challenging environments.

Conclusion: GAP successfully bridges the gap between point clouds and 3D Gaussians, enabling high-fidelity Gaussian generation with text guidance and ensuring both visual consistency and geometric accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FaceAnonyMixer, a framework that generates privacy-preserving images for face recognition systems while ensuring biometric template protection features like revocability and irreversibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in face recognition, existing anonymization methods fail to meet biometric template protection standards, raising the need for improved privacy-preserving solutions.

Method: FaceAnonyMixer mixes a real face's latent code with a synthetic code from a revocable key using a generative model while optimizing a multi-objective loss to ensure privacy requirements are met.

Result: Experiments show that FaceAnonyMixer improves privacy protection and achieves an over 11% accuracy gain on commercial APIs compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer effectively balances face recognition accuracy with robust privacy protection, setting a new standard for cancelable biometric systems.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPTIMUMP2P, a gossip algorithm using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to improve libp2p's performance and reliability in decentralized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to enhance the dissemination of information in decentralized systems and blockchain protocols, ensuring faster and more reliable message delivery even in adversarial conditions.

Method: OPTIMUMP2P applies Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite information dissemination and ensure reliable delivery in a peer-to-peer network, countering data corruption from malicious entities.

Result: Experimental evaluations, both in simulation and real-world settings, reveal that OPTIMUMP2P outperforms the existing Gossipsub protocol in terms of performance gains.

Conclusion: OPTIMUMP2P offers improved block propagation and message reliability for decentralized networks, establishing its supremacy over traditional gossip algorithms through RLNC.

Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within
decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been
developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the
propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p,
which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms
enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we
aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing
OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random
Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the
presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data.
Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of
RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we
present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world
environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the
Gossipsub protocol.

*Khaled Jawhar,Evangelos Kranakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents linear search algorithms for two robots, each with different communication capabilities, aiming to capture a moving target under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how asymmetric communication between two robots affects the ability to efficiently capture a moving target under different movement behaviors.

Method: Develop and analyze linear search algorithms under Sender/Receiver communication models, focusing on various scenarios relating to robots' knowledge of the environment.

Result: Competitive ratios for capture time are analyzed in relation to different starting conditions, motions, and robot communication models.

Conclusion: Understanding asymmetric communication enables improved strategies for collaborative robotic search tasks, optimizing capture performance.

Abstract: We consider linear search for capturing an oblivious moving target by two
autonomous robots with different communicating abilities. Both robots can
communicate Face-to-Face (F2F) when co-located but in addition one robot is a
Sender (can also send messages wirelessly) and the other also a Receiver (can
also receive messages wirelessly). This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for
short) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving
target starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed
$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \geq 0$
toward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of
motion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to
the robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located
with it.
  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of
the time required to capture the target. The approach takes into account
various scenarios related to what the robots know about the search environment
(e.g., starting distance or speed of the mobile, away or toward model, or a
combination thereof). Our study contributes to understanding how asymmetric
communication affects the competitive ratio of linear search.

Abstract: Gen3 is an open-source data platform for building data commons. A data
commons is a cloud-based data platform for managing, analyzing, and sharing
data with a research community. Gen3 has been used to build over a dozen data
commons that in aggregate contain over 28 PB of data and 64 million FAIR data
objects. To set up a Gen3 data commons, you first define a data model. Gen3
then autogenerates 1) a data portal for searching and exploring data in the
commons; 2) a data portal for submitting data to the commons; and 3) FAIR APIs
for accessing the data programmatically. Gen3 is built over a small number of
standards-based software services, which are designed to support current and
future Gen3 components so that Gen3 can interoperate with other data platforms
and data ecosystems.

### [183] [Tesserae: Scalable Placement Policies for Deep Learning Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04953)
*Song Bian,Saurabh Agarwal,Md. Tareq Mahmood,Shivaram Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tesserae, a scalable GPU cluster scheduler using graph matching-based job placement policies, achieving significant improvements in job completion time and makespan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource utilization inefficiencies in deep learning cluster schedulers caused by suboptimal placement policies.

Method: The authors formulate placement constraints as graph matching problems, leading to new policies for reducing job migration overheads and improving job packing. These are integrated into Tesserae.

Result: Tesserae improves average job completion time (JCT) by up to 1.62x and makespan by up to 1.15x compared to existing schedulers.

Conclusion: Graph matching-based placement strategies in Tesserae enable more scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduling, optimizing deep learning workloads.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-order solvers for compressible flows paired with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to focus computational resources in areas of interest.

Method: Implemented AMR techniques using Regent with features like dynamic data structures, mesh validity enforcement, and optimizing task execution via task fusion.

Result: Task fusion yields 18x speedup, and automated GPU kernel generation achieves 9.7x speedup in simulations of compressible flow problems.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates efficient use of AMR techniques on Regent through enhanced speed and effective simulation of compressible flows.

Abstract: High-order solvers for compressible flows are vital in scientific
applications. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a key technique for reducing
computational cost by concentrating resolution in regions of interest. In this
work, we develop an AMR-based numerical solver using Regent, a high-level
programming language for the Legion programming model. We address several
challenges associated with implementing AMR in Regent. These include dynamic
data structures for patch refinement/coarsening, mesh validity enforcement, and
reducing task launch overhead via task fusion. Experimental results show that
task fusion achieves 18x speedup, while automated GPU kernel generation via
simple annotations yields 9.7x speedup for the targeted kernel. We demonstrate
our approach through simulations of two canonical compressible flow problems
governed by the Euler equations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Theseus is a GPU-accelerated distributed query engine designed for large-scale analytical processing, outperforming alternatives with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling many-terabyte datasets for online analytical queries typically requires expensive distributed systems, creating the need for cost reduction and throughput improvement, especially by leveraging GPU acceleration.

Method: The paper presents Theseus, a distributed query engine that optimally manages data movement, memory utilization, and computation in accelerator-based systems. It integrates asynchronous control mechanisms and a specialized memory subsystem to enhance performance.

Result: Theseus outperforms Databricks Photon by up to 4x at cost parity on TPC-H benchmarks at scales of 1k to 30k, and processes TPC-H/DS 100 TB scale benchmarks using just 2 DGX A100 nodes.

Conclusion: Theseus demonstrates efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, validating its utility for enterprise-scale GPU-accelerated data querying.

Abstract: Online analytical processing of queries on datasets in the many-terabyte
range is only possible with costly distributed computing systems. To decrease
the cost and increase the throughput, systems can leverage accelerators such as
GPUs, which are now ubiquitous in the compute infrastructure. This introduces
many challenges, the majority of which are related to when, where, and how to
best move data around the system. We present Theseus -- a production-ready
enterprise-scale distributed accelerator-native query engine designed to
balance data movement, memory utilization, and computation in an
accelerator-based system context. Specialized asynchronous control mechanisms
are tightly coupled to the hardware resources for the purpose of network
communication, data pre-loading, data spilling across memories and storage, and
GPU compute tasks. The memory subsystem contains a mechanism for fixed-size
page-locked host memory allocations to increase throughput and reduce memory
fragmentation. For the TPC-H benchmarks at scale factors ranging from 1k to 30k
on cloud infrastructure, Theseus outperforms Databricks Photon by up to
$4\times$ at cost parity. Theseus is capable of processing all queries of the
TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks at scale factor 100k (100 TB scale) with as few as
2 DGX A100 640GB nodes.

*Sumit Kumar,Arjun Temura,Naman Sharma,Ramanjeet Singh,Meet Dadhania,Praveen Tammana,Satananda Burla,Abed Mohammad Kamaluddin,Rinku Shah*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a heterogeneity-aware simulator for distributed LLM training, addressing computational and infrastructural variances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for distributed GPU clusters creates challenges in optimizing model training, and existing simulators fail to account for real-world infrastructure heterogeneity.

Method: The paper introduces a heterogeneity-aware simulator that incorporates custom configurations and non-uniform workload partitioning.

Result: The simulator shows how heterogeneity influences computation and communication time in distributed LLM training.

Conclusion: Addressing heterogeneity can improve accuracy and decision-making in distributed LLM training using simulations.

Abstract: The growing demand for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training
presents a significant barrier to innovation, particularly in model
optimization, performance tuning, and system-level enhancements. To address
this challenge, LLM training simulators are employed to estimate training time
and guide design decisions. However, the state-of-the-art LLM training
simulators assume homogeneous compute and network infrastructure. In practice,
device heterogeneity is inevitable due to resource sharing in cloud
environments, frequent shifts in device generations, and inherent intra-chip
interconnect heterogeneity. To address the gap between state-of-the-art and
practical requirements, we propose the design of a heterogeneity-aware
distributed LLM simulator capable of predicting training time while enabling
abstractions to specify custom configurations for device groups and
device-to-parallelism mapping. We present the design requirements and
challenges in building a heterogeneity-aware distributed ML training simulator,
and design components such as non-uniform workload partitioning. Our initial
simulation results demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity on the model
computation and communication time.

*Rasman Mubtasim Swargo,Engin Arslan,Md Arifuzzaman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FastBioDL is a tool for downloading large biological datasets that employs an adaptive concurrency controller, resulting in significantly faster downloads compared to static tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in downloading large genomic datasets due to static settings in existing tools.

Method: Uses an adaptive concurrency controller framed as an online optimization problem via a utility function and gradient descent to adjust the number of concurrent streams.

Result: Achieved up to 4x speedup over state-of-the-art tools, and up to 2.1x faster performance in high-speed network experiments.

Conclusion: FastBioDL provides a powerful, efficient, and accessible solution for genomic data retrieval without requiring specialized software.

Abstract: Modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects routinely generate terabytes
of data, which researchers commonly download from public repositories such as
SRA or ENA. Existing download tools often employ static concurrency settings,
leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization and prolonged download times due
to their inability to adapt to dynamic network conditions. We introduce
FastBioDL, a parallel file downloader designed for large biological datasets,
featuring an adaptive concurrency controller. FastBioDL frames the download
process as an online optimization problem, utilizing a utility function and
gradient descent to adjust the number of concurrent socket streams in real-time
dynamically. This approach maximizes download throughput while minimizing
resource overhead. Comprehensive evaluations on public genomic datasets
demonstrate that FastBioDL achieves up to $4x$ speedup over state-of-the-art
tools. Moreover, in high-speed network experiments, its adaptive design was up
to $2.1x$ faster than existing tools. By intelligently optimizing standard HTTP
or FTP downloads on the client side, FastBioDL provides a robust and efficient
solution for large-scale genomic data acquisition, democratizing
high-performance data retrieval for researchers without requiring specialized
commercial software or protocols.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMDT, a modular data transfer architecture using deep reinforcement learning for faster and efficient large dataset transfers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional file transfer tools struggle with inefficiencies and instability due to static settings and monolithic approaches, making them unsuitable for high-performance data transfers across distributed systems.

Method: AutoMDT uses a modular design with a reinforcement learning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to optimize data transfer parameters. It includes a lightweight simulator for offline training, decoupling I/O and network operations.

Result: AutoMDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 8x faster convergence and reducing data transfer completion times by 68% in production environments.

Conclusion: AutoMDT demonstrates the potential of combining modular architectures with reinforcement learning to significantly enhance data transfer speed and reliability under varying system conditions.

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of
massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file
transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability
because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose
AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep
reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency
levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a
lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby
overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production
networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing
the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to
changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade
testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68%
reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art
solutions.

*Mansi Sharma,Enrico Sartor,Marc Cavazza,Helmut Prendinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores applying Echo State Networks (ESNs) for both stock and cryptocurrency forecasting, particularly during chaotic and highly volatile market conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the challenges in forecasting induced by volatility and non-stationarity, the study aims to leverage the capabilities of ESNs to improve prediction models, especially in the underexplored domain of cryptocurrencies.

Method: The authors implement ESNs alongside chaos analysis using the Lyapunov exponent during periods of high volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

Result: ESNs significantly outperform conventional machine learning methods, such as Boosting and Naïve models, particularly during chaotic periods. These findings align with the chaos analysis using Lyapunov exponents.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ESNs are highly effective and robust for forecasting in chaotic and volatile financial environments, offering superior performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

*Shruti Saxena,Arijit Khan,Joydeep Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAEx, an interpretability framework for network alignment tasks, addressing the challenge of understanding alignment decisions by explaining key subgraphs and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network alignment models, though advanced, lack interpretability, making it difficult to trust their outputs, especially in domains like biology and social networks, where decisions are critical.

Method: The authors develop NAEx, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution that uses learnable edge and feature masks along with an optimization objective to generate faithful and comparative explanations.

Result: NAEx was tested on benchmark datasets with four network alignment models, showing both effectiveness and efficiency in generating interpretable results.

Conclusion: NAEx provides an innovative, inductive approach to explain network alignment decisions while being adaptable to unseen data, facilitating trust in alignment models.

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLES, a novel programmatic policy discovery approach combining multimodal large language models and evolutionary search for interpretable and high-performing control policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenges of high performance and interpretability in control policy design, particularly in safety-critical tasks.

Method: MLES uses multimodal large language models for policy generation, visual behavior analysis for identifying failure patterns, and evolutionary search for optimizing control policies.

Result: MLES achieves competitive policy discovery efficiency and effectiveness compared to PPO, while offering interpretable policy design and improved adaptability.

Conclusion: MLES is a scalable and promising approach for next-generation interpretable control policy discovery, overcoming domain-specific constraints and facilitating knowledge reuse.

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

### [192] [Agnostics: Learning to Code in Any Programming Language via Reinforcement with a Universal Learning Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04865)
*Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki,Yangtian Zi,Zixuan Wu,Tejas Oberoi,Carolyn Jane Anderson,Joydeep Biswas,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline for improving large language models (LLMs) in low-resource programming languages. It eliminates per-language engineering efforts by focusing on code behavior rather than syntax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages due to limited pre-training data and the complexity of post-training setups. The authors aim to simplify post-training for these languages.

Method: Agnostics leverages a single verifier to judge code behavior across languages. It uses existing unit-test datasets, language compilation configurations, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust environment.

Result: The approach significantly improves performance for low-resource languages across various LLMs, rivaling larger models and setting new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MultiPL-E and LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: Agnostics simplifies RL post-training for any programming language through language-agnostic datasets, reusable configurations, and open-source tools, aiming to democratize advancements in coding AI for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LumiGen, a system enhancing text-to-image generation by leveraging vision-language models (LVLMs) to improve fine-grained content control and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in current text-to-image generation models which struggle with complex instructions, fine-grained content control, and deep semantic consistency.

Method: They introduce LumiGen, which combines an Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for better prompts and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module acting as a visual critic for iterative corrections.

Result: LumiGen achieves a superior average score of 3.08 on the LongBench-T2I Benchmark, outperforming existing models in text rendering, pose generation, and compositional coherence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the integration of LVLMs as crucial for achieving more controllable, higher-quality image generation, setting a new benchmark for T2I models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

TL;DR: TrajEvo proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms to design trajectory prediction heuristics that overcome challenges like poor generalization and high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in trajectory prediction tasks—poor generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios and the computational inefficiencies of deep learning methods.

Method: The framework introduces TrajEvo, which uses LLMs to create heuristics for trajectory prediction. Innovations such as Cross-Generation Elite Sampling and a Statistics Feedback Loop enhance diversity and refine prediction.

Result: TrajEvo shows superior performance over heuristic and deep learning methods across real-world datasets, especially in handling out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: TrajEvo offers a promising approach for creating explainable and efficient prediction models, advancing research in trajectory prediction in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

*Nan Li,Wanting Yang,Marie Siew,Zehui Xiong,Binbin Chen,Shiwen Mao,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to make diffusion models more efficient for edge devices, combining federated learning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to improve scalability, personalization, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices often lack the computational power to run diffusion models effectively, and cloud-based solutions introduce privacy risks, inefficiencies, and high communication costs. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The authors propose a cluster-aware hierarchical federated aggregation framework. It clusters clients based on task similarity, performs intra-cluster aggregation, enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing, and trains personalized models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient edge inference.

Result: The framework enhances efficiency, privacy, and scalability in multi-user environments by clustering, encoded prompt transmission, and leveraging LoRA for local fine-tuning. Evaluation shows accelerated convergence and practical usability for edge devices.

Conclusion: This novel framework addresses the computational and privacy challenges of multi-user edge-based diffusion models with efficient training and inference methodologies that maintain scalability and user personalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC

### [197] [A Foundational Multi-Modal Model for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04746)
*Pengtao Dang,Tingbo Guo,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot learning (M3F) framework and creates a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD) to improve few-shot learning (FSL) applications in data-scarce scientific fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in domains like biomedical and environmental sciences, where labeled data is rare and expensive to collect, necessitating innovation in FSL approaches.

Method: The paper introduces M3F, a large multi-modal model framework leveraging diverse datasets (M3FD, comprising 2D images, medical scans, tabular/time-course data) through a modular pipeline and fine-tuning process to address data-constrained tasks.

Result: M3F outperforms traditional meta-learning models in generalizing FSL tasks using its modular approach, demonstrating notable improvements in performance across scientific data types.

Conclusion: The framework and coupled dataset reduce the barrier to applying large multi-modal models in scientific areas with limited data, making FSL models more deployable and reproducible in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework, enhances molecular property predictions with LLMs by improving reasoning and output relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of verbose and irrelevant reasoning in LLMs for molecular property predictions, and reliance on human-crafted prompts and templates.

Method: Introduced attribute-guided reinforcement learning with rewards focusing on format, attribute count, and rationality for structured and relevant reasoning in molecular predictions.

Result: Achieved comparable or better results than supervised models and advanced LLMs using AttriLens-Mol, with improved interpretability and predictive performance.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol elicits relevant molecular attributes effectively, enhancing molecular property prediction performance and interpretability, validated through experiments and open-source code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

### [199] [PA-RNet: Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04750)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PA-RNet, a robust model for multimodal time series forecasting that effectively handles noisy textual data through innovative modules and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal time series data, particularly textual modality, often contain irrelevant noise that degrades forecasting accuracy. Current methods fail to address these perturbations adequately.

Method: The PA-RNet framework incorporates a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal attention mechanism to filter textual noise while preserving semantic integrity. It is complemented by a textual perturbation pipeline for robustness evaluation.

Result: PA-RNet achieves superior performance in multimodal time series forecasting tasks when compared to state-of-the-art baselines, as demonstrated in experiments across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The novel perturbation-aware design of PA-RNet improves model stability and forecasting accuracy in noisy real-world settings, offering strong theoretical and practical contributions.

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [200] [InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753)
*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ is a novel framework for mixed-precision quantization that focuses on bit-width selection by measuring changes in mutual information flow during a single forward pass, achieving efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization sensitivity in neural networks is often measured using local heuristics, which neglect global cascading effects. There is a need for efficient methods to optimize bit-width allocation for resource-constrained devices.

Method: InfoQ evaluates layer sensitivity by analyzing the changes in mutual information from bit-width variations in a single forward pass and solves bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem under resource constraints.

Result: InfoQ achieves significant efficiency in search time by using less data compared to current methods like LIMPQ while improving accuracy by up to 1% in highly compressed models such as MobileNetV2 and ResNet18.

Conclusion: InfoQ offers a more effective and computationally efficient approach for mixed-precision quantization by leveraging mutual information measurements, leading to superior trade-offs between accuracy and compression rates.

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

### [201] [Are Large Language Models Dynamic Treatment Planners? An In Silico Study from a Prior Knowledge Injection Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04755)
*Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs) are evaluated for dynamic insulin dosing in Type 1 diabetes. LLMs with well-designed prompts match RL performance but have key limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in clinical decision-making, particularly in dynamic treatment regimes, eliminating the need for environment-specific training.

Method: LLMs, via zero-shot prompting, were tested in an in silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their performance with reinforcement learning agents explicitly trained for the task.

Result: Smaller LLMs performed comparably or better than trained RL agents in stable patient cohorts, yet revealed challenges like aggressive dosing and reasoning errors.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in clinical applications but require refined prompt engineering, validation, and potential hybrid approaches for safe and reliable integration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

### [202] [HFedATM: Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization via Optimal Transport and Regularized Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05135)
*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization (HFedDG) to tackle domain shifts in hierarchical federated learning frameworks, proposing the HFedATM method to enhance model performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scalability and domain shift challenges in hierarchical federated learning frameworks, and improve robustness to domain shifts across different client stations.

Method: The proposed method, HFedATM, first aligns convolutional filters across stations using Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment, followed by merging aligned models through Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation.

Result: Experimental evaluations show HFedATM significantly improves on existing Federated Domain Generalization methods across various datasets, while maintaining computational and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that HFedATM enhances model performance in hierarchical federated learning settings, achieves better generalization error bounds, and ensures stable training behavior with faster convergence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

### [203] [Gaussian mixture layers for neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04883)
*Sinho Chewi,Philippe Rigollet,Yuling Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian mixture models to train measures directly in neural networks, proposing a novel Gaussian mixture (GM) layer with results comparable to classical networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether training dynamics can be implemented directly over probability measures, moving beyond the classic mean-field theory applied to wide neural networks.

Method: Employ Gaussian mixture models as parametric distributions combined with Wasserstein gradient flows to derive training dynamics; introduce a Gaussian mixture layer in neural architectures.

Result: Experiments showed GM layers achieve comparable performance to classical two-layer networks and exhibit distinct dynamics compared to standard wide-layer networks.

Conclusion: This novel approach demonstrates the potential of GM layers, expanding the application of probability measures in neural networks for future innovative designs.

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

### [204] [Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780)
*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EPOPR, a framework to improve equity and efficiency in power system restoration after extreme weather events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inequities in current power restoration strategies, which leave disadvantaged communities more vulnerable to prolonged outages.

Method: It develops EPOPR, a framework using Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for repair duration prediction and Spatial-Temporal Attentional Reinforcement Learning for equitable decision-making.

Result: EPOPR reduces average power outage duration by 3.60% and inequity between communities by 14.19% compared to current methods.

Conclusion: EPOPR demonstrates the potential to enhance both restoration efficiency and equity, making it a promising strategy for future power restoration efforts.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-VFL, a new Vertical Federated Learning framework that addresses challenges related to non-aligned data and independent client inference by using Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical Federated Learning struggles with requirements for aligned data and joint inference, limiting its applicability in scenarios with missing features or independent client operations.

Method: The authors propose X-VFL, incorporating Cross Completion for feature reconstruction and Decision Subspace Alignment for local inference. They also prove convergence rates for associated algorithms.

Result: X-VFL achieves up to 15% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10 and 43% on MIMIC-III datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness over existing methods.

Conclusion: The study validates X-VFL as a promising solution for incomplete data and independent inference challenges in Vertical Federated Learning.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCUKF, a framework for modeling complex systems by integrating reservoir computing (RC) and unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) to improve state estimation in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is difficult, especially in high-dimensional or chaotic regimes, motivating the need for a novel approach combining data-driven modeling and real-time updates.

Method: The framework integrates reservoir computing to learn system dynamics from data and unscented Kalman filtering for state estimation, blending data-driven modeling with Bayesian updates on sensor inputs.

Result: RCUKF proves effective in benchmark scenarios and a simulated vehicle trajectory estimation task, showcasing its capability to address complex system modeling challenges.

Conclusion: RCUKF combines the strengths of RC and UKF to enhance state estimation accuracy, addressing shortcomings of conventional models in challenging applications.

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

*Jaehyung Lim,Wonbin Kweon,Woojoo Kim,Junyoung Kim,Seongjin Choi,Dongha Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of combining federated learning (FL) and continual learning (CL) for recommendation systems under privacy constraints, introducing the novel task of Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec) and proposing the F3CRec framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to consistently maintain recommendation quality over time under privacy constraints in federated learning systems, especially with dynamic user data streams.

Method: F3CRec incorporates Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side to selectively retain past preferences and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side to blend new knowledge with existing information.

Result: Experiments show that F3CRec outperforms other approaches in sustaining recommendation quality within federated environments over long-term usage.

Conclusion: F3CRec successfully bridges the gap between FL and CL for recommendations, enabling privacy-preserving adaptive learning from non-stationary data streams.

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

*Amichai Painsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework to identify the best machine learning algorithm from a benchmark, ensuring high confidence in results by applying subset selection methods for multinomial distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively identifying the best-performing algorithm from a benchmark is challenging due to marginal performance differences, requiring improved methods to ensure robust selection on unseen data.

Method: The authors propose a novel subset selection framework for multinomial distributions, including asymptotic and finite-sample schemes, and derive matching lower bounds.

Result: The novel methods provide significant improvements over existing subset selection approaches while demonstrating performance advantages through theoretical lower bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the confidence and accuracy in selecting the top-performing algorithm, offering robust and improved methods for subset selection problems.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

*Lin Jiang,Yu Yang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCRide, a human-centered ride-hailing system utilizing a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method to balance efficiency, passenger fairness, and driver preference, with promising results outperforming current baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ride-hailing systems prioritize operator revenue, often neglecting passenger fairness and driver preferences, leading to suboptimal experiences for both groups.

Method: The paper proposes HCRide employing a Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic) algorithm featuring a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic network.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets from Shenzhen and NYC demonstrate improvements in system efficiency (2.02%), fairness (5.39%), and driver preference (10.21%) over existing methods.

Conclusion: HCRide successfully balances the trade-offs between fairness, preferences, and efficiency, offering a substantial improvement in human-centered ride-hailing system designs.

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [210] [Unified Flow Matching for Long Horizon Event Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04843)
*Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for modeling long horizon marked event sequences using unified flow matching, addressing inefficiencies in autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of existing neural temporal point process models, particularly error accumulation and inefficiency in long-range forecasting.

Method: The proposed method uses unified flow matching to jointly model inter-event times and event types, employing continuous and discrete flow matching instead of sequential autoregressive decoding.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in terms of accuracy and generation efficiency across six real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified flow matching framework enables coherent and efficient long horizon event trajectory modeling, addressing shortcomings of traditional methods.

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

*Yixuan Zhang,Wenxin Zhang,Hua Jiang,Quyu Kong,Feng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NegBio-VAE, a novel extension of VAEs which uses the negative binomial distribution instead of Poisson to more accurately model biological neural spike activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of Poisson-based VAEs in modeling the complex variability of neural spike data, specifically their inability to handle overdispersion.

Method: The authors replace the Poisson distribution with a negative binomial distribution in VAEs, introducing a dispersion parameter. They develop two optimized ELBO schemes and reparameterization strategies tailored for this new framework.

Result: NegBio-VAE demonstrates improved reconstruction fidelity when modeling spike-like neural activity, emphasizing the significance of capturing overdispersion.

Conclusion: By incorporating a dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE expands the modeling capacity of VAEs for neural data, marking an important step toward biologically inspired representation learning.

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel intrusion detection framework for CAN protocol using unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning, achieving notable performance gains in cyber-attack detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the CAN protocol widely used in automotive systems, which lacks embedded security measures.

Method: The framework combines a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for anomaly detection and Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for attack classification, utilizing graph encoding of CAN traffic and selective undersampling.

Result: The technique improved F1-score by an average of 16.2% over existing methods on public datasets and excelled on imbalanced datasets with up to 55% F1-score improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and efficient for intrusion detection in the CAN protocol, combining advanced machine learning techniques for better cybersecurity in automotive applications.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

### [213] [Provable Post-Training Quantization: Theoretical Analysis of OPTQ and Qronos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04853)
*Haoyu Zhang,Shihao Zhang,Ian Colbert,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first quantitative error bounds for the OPTQ post-training quantization algorithm, analyzing both deterministic and stochastic variants, and extends this analysis to the Qronos algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees for OPTQ and related PTQ algorithms, despite their widespread adoption and impressive empirical performance.

Method: The researchers analyze OPTQ's quantization error through iterative procedures and derive non-asymptotic error bounds. They explore the role of calibration data, feature ordering by norm, and a regularization parameter, and extend these insights to the Qronos algorithm.

Result: The analysis yields 2-norm and infinity-norm error bounds that justify practical design choices in OPTQ, provide guidance for parameter selection, and extend to explain the advantages of the Qronos algorithm.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical justification for OPTQ's design and practical guidance for improvements, laying a foundation for more robust and efficient PTQ algorithms like Qronos.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

*Saman Pordanesh,Pejman Shahsavari,Hossein Ghadjari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HNO introduces a new neural operator utilizing the Hilbert transform to enhance PDE solution learning with spectral convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traditional Fourier Neural Operators, including periodicity assumptions and limited perspectives on signal analysis.

Method: HNO employs the Hilbert transform to analyze input signals, explicitly capturing instantaneous amplitude and phase. Spectral convolution is applied to the transformed data.

Result: HNO architecture is theorized to enhance modeling for causal and phase-sensitive systems, leveraging analytic signal theory.

Conclusion: Explicit usage of analytic signal features provides a stronger inductive bias for improved neural operator learning for PDEs.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

### [215] [Uncertainty Quantification for Surface Ozone Emulators using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04885)
*Kelsey Doerksen,Yuliya Marchetti,Steven Lu,Kevin Bowman,James Montgomery,Kazuyuki Miyazaki,Yarin Gal,Freddie Kalaitzis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture to model and correct biases in surface ozone estimations, improving regional air pollution predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution, specifically surface ozone, poses widespread health risks globally, but existing models struggle to accurately capture trends at meaningful scales.

Method: The researchers implemented an uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture using Bayesian and quantile regression methods to predict biases in a chemical assimilation model for surface ozone.

Result: The model successfully estimated biases for North America and Europe in June 2019, while offering insights into optimal ground stations for model corrections and the impact of land-use data.

Conclusion: This approach enhances decision-making by improving ozone bias estimations and offers tools for better addressing air pollution via uncertainty quantification methodologies and improved data integration.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

*Kelsey Doerksen,Yuliya Marchetti,Kevin Bowman,Steven Lu,James Montgomery,Yarin Gal,Freddie Kalaitzis,Kazuyuki Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to address surface ozone predictions by correcting biases in physics-based models, improving accuracy in North America and Europe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution causes over 6 million premature deaths in 2019, with challenges in accurately modeling surface ozone at human-relevant scales, limiting effective predictions for health and policy impacts.

Method: A 2D CNN estimates residuals (model bias) in MOMO-Chem physics-based surface ozone models. The approach is tested with added land-use details from satellite imagery for improved accuracy.

Result: The proposed 2D CNN approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques in capturing model residuals in North America and Europe.

Conclusion: The research enhances understanding of ozone bias at urban scales, aiding in better environmental policy formulation and advancing predictions for human health impacts.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

### [217] [Retrieval-Augmented Water Level Forecasting for Everglades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04888)
*Rahuul Rangaraj,Jimeng Shi,Rajendra Paudel,Giri Narasimhan,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) framework for water level prediction, improving accuracy by integrating historical hydrological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water level forecasting is critical for ecosystem management, but current models often lack adaptability and struggle with unseen datasets in hydrology.

Method: Introduces RAF, which retrieves relevant historical data for multivariate analysis to enhance input for forecasting, avoiding retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: RAF significantly improves water level prediction accuracy in tests conducted on real-world data from the Everglades.

Conclusion: RAF demonstrates potential in hydrology and ecosystem management by offering an effective and adaptive forecasting framework.

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

### [218] [Honest and Reliable Evaluation and Expert Equivalence Testing of Automated Neonatal Seizure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04899)
*Jovana Kljajic,John M. O'Toole,Robert Hogan,Tamara Skoric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates current practices in assessing machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection, identifying challenges and proposing best practices for unbiased and consistent metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of machine learning for neonatal seizure detection requires reliable and unbiased evaluation practices, as current methods often lead to biased metrics and unreliable claims.

Method: The study uses real and synthetic seizure annotations to evaluate standard metrics, consensus strategies, and equivalence tests while accounting for factors like class imbalance and inter-rater agreement.

Result: Matthews and Pearson's coefficients are better suited for imbalanced data than AUC. Consensus is affected by rater count and agreement. Multi-rater Turing test with Fleiss k effectively gauges expert-level AI performance.

Conclusion: A comprehensive framework, including balanced metrics, sensitivity/specificity measures, multi-rater Turing test, and validation on held-out datasets, is essential for trustworthy machine learning evaluation in neonatal seizure detection.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

### [219] [Sensitivity of Stability: Theoretical & Empirical Analysis of Replicability for Adaptive Data Selection in Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04901)
*Prabhav Singh,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between performance and replicability in transfer learning when using adaptive data selection strategies, introducing a theoretical framework and the concept of selection sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of understanding around the reliability of adaptations in transfer learning, especially with adaptive data selection strategies.

Method: The authors introduce a mathematical framework to study replicability and selection sensitivity, and verify their theoretical findings through extensive experiments on the MultiNLI corpus with six adaptive selection strategies.

Result: The study shows that highly adaptive strategies improve task performance but increase replicability failure rates, while less adaptive ones achieve lower failure rates. Source domain pretraining reduces failure rates by up to 30%.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidelines for balancing performance and replicability in transfer learning and emphasize the importance of a replicability-aware design for adaptive strategies.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines transformer-based models for detecting hate speech on social media using a large dataset, with fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combat the harmful social, psychological, and physical effects of hate speech propagated on social media, which is increasingly linked to real-world hate crimes, through advanced detection methods.

Method: The study explored transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, using the MetaHate dataset containing 1.2 million samples from 36 datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.8980. Error analysis highlighted challenges with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models, particularly fine-tuned ELECTRA, show strong promise in detecting hate speech, though certain nuances like sarcasm and label quality pose ongoing challenges.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

*Chenkai Wu,Yuanyuan Qi,Xiaohao Yang,Jueqing Lu,Gang Liu,Wray Buntine,Lan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Active Learning (DAL) aims to minimize annotation costs by prioritizing informative data samples for labeling, facing challenges like data imbalance and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A unified evaluation approach for Deep Active Learning algorithms is needed to address challenges stemming from data imbalance and distribution shifts.

Method: Creation of ALScope, a platform with 10 datasets and 21 DAL algorithms for systematic evaluation across diverse configurations and scenarios.

Result: Experiments reveal variability in performance across different scenarios and highlight challenges, such as imbalanced and open-set settings.

Conclusion: There’s substantial room for improvement in DAL algorithms, especially under non-standard conditions, and performance comes at a computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

*Nameer Hirschkind,Joseph Liu,Mahesh Kumar Nandwana,Xiao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REINA, a loss function based on information theory, to optimize translation quality and latency in Simultaneous Speech Translation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing translation quality and latency in SimulST systems is a challenging task, and an optimized strategy is needed to enhance this tradeoff.

Method: The authors developed the Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA) loss function, derived from information theory principles, to train adaptive policies using an existing non-streaming model.

Result: Using REINA, the authors achieved significant improvements in the latency/quality tradeoff, outperforming prior works and achieving state-of-the-art results in streaming efficiency across multiple languages.

Conclusion: REINA offers a robust framework to improve SimulST systems significantly, both in translation quality and latency, setting a new benchmark for efficiency in such models.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

### [223] [Self-Error Adjustment: Theory and Practice of Balancing Individual Performance and Diversity in Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04948)
*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Self-Error Adjustment (SEA) method refines ensemble learning by introducing an adjustable parameter to manage the trade-off between learner accuracy and diversity, outperforming traditional methods like Negative Correlation Learning (NCL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble learning methods like Bagging and Boosting struggle to precisely manage the balance between individual accuracy and diversity in base learners.

Method: SEA decomposes ensemble errors into individual self-error and diversity terms, enabling precise control through an adjustable parameter in the loss function.

Result: SEA demonstrates superior performance and flexibility compared to NCL and its variants, validated through tighter theoretical bounds and experiments on public datasets.

Conclusion: SEA advances ensemble learning by providing a more effective framework for balancing accuracy and diversity, with consistent improvements observed across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

*Wei Liu,Anweshit Panda,Ujwal Pandey,Christopher Brissette,Yikang Shen,George M. Slota,Naigang Wang,Jie Chen,Yangyang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes two compressed decentralized algorithms for nonconvex stochastic optimization using momentum acceleration and message compression, achieving optimal convergence rates and superior empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address high communication costs in decentralized optimization, while maintaining fast convergence and effective theoretical guarantees for combined momentum and compression techniques.

Method: Designed two algorithms: a compressed decentralized adaptive method for bounded gradients, and a heavy-ball method with gradient tracking for data heterogeneity without bounded gradients.

Result: Both algorithms achieve optimal convergence rates, linear speedup, topology-independent parameters, and exceptional empirical performance in training DNNs and Transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively combine momentum and message compression, addressing both bounded and heterogeneous data scenarios to advance decentralized optimization approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MENDR, a novel EEG foundation model for learning interpretable representations using wavelet-based features and a Riemannian Manifold Transformer, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of current EEG foundation models, which often lack interpretability, transparency in training dynamics, and effective utilization of advanced signal processing methods, such as wavelets.

Method: The proposed method involves creating MENDR, a foundation model leveraging discrete wavelet packet transforms for multi-resolution decompositions and a Riemannian Manifold Transformer to generate symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals.

Result: MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance across clinical EEG analysis tasks with fewer parameters, enhances interpretability via geometric visualization of embeddings, and supports accurate reconstruction of signals.

Conclusion: MENDR is a step forward in transparent and interpretable EEG analysis, demonstrating its potential for clinical application while maintaining computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

*Luai Abuelsamen,Temitope Lukman Adebanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of multimodal perception in imitation learning through statistical learning theory, showing improved generalization and optimization in multimodal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal data affects sample complexity and optimization in imitation learning and why multimodal architectures often outperform unimodal ones.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis grounded in statistical learning theory, focusing on generalization bounds and optimization landscapes, while reviewing frameworks like PAC learning and Rademacher complexity.

Result: It demonstrates that properly integrated multimodal policies have tighter generalization bounds and better optimization properties compared to unimodal policies.

Conclusion: Multimodal policies provide a theoretical and practical advantage in imitation learning due to better generalization and optimization properties, as supported by links to statistical learning theory concepts.

Abstract: This paper examines the theoretical foundations of multimodal imitation
learning through the lens of statistical learning theory. We analyze how
multimodal perception (RGB-D, proprioception, language) affects sample
complexity and optimization landscapes in imitation policies. Building on
recent advances in multimodal learning theory, we show that properly integrated
multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more
favorable optimization landscapes than their unimodal counterparts. We provide
a comprehensive review of theoretical frameworks that explain why multimodal
architectures like PerAct and CLIPort achieve superior performance, connecting
these empirical results to fundamental concepts in Rademacher complexity, PAC
learning, and information theory.

*Jelle Luijkx,Zlatan Ajanović,Laura Ferranti,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the ASkDAgger framework to reduce human teaching effort in interactive imitation learning by utilizing novice uncertainty and improving query efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck in interactive imitation learning, necessitating efficient query mechanisms.

Method: The ASkDAgger framework combines three components: SAG for gating sensitivity, FIER for recasting novice plans, and PIER for prioritized experience replay based on uncertainty, success, and demo age.

Result: The framework improves query efficiency, reduces required demonstration annotations, enhances generalization, and accelerates domain adaptation.

Conclusion: ASkDAgger effectively minimizes human teaching effort while enabling efficient and adaptive learning, validated through experiments in simulation and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

### [228] [Disentangling Bias by Modeling Intra- and Inter-modal Causal Attention for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04999)
*Menghua Jiang,Yuxia Lin,Baoliang Chen,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMCI, a model for enhancing multimodal sentiment analysis by mitigating spurious correlations through causal intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations within and across modalities in MSA cause models to rely on statistical shortcuts, undermining generalization.

Method: The MMCI model uses multi-relational graphs, attention mechanisms, and the backdoor adjustment from causal inference to disentangle causal from shortcut features and improve robustness under distribution shifts.

Result: The MMCI model shows enhanced suppression of biases and improved performance on standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: By addressing spurious correlations using causal frameworks, MMCI advances the field of MSA, enabling more stable and generalizable predictions.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

### [229] [R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)
*Chengsong Huang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Hongming Zhang,Zongxia Li,Ruosen Li,Jiaxin Huang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called R-Zero, which autonomously generates training data and improves Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on human-curated tasks or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLMs depend heavily on human-curated datasets, which limits the potential for LLMs to surpass human intelligence.

Method: The authors propose R-Zero, a framework involving two models: a Challenger that poses tasks and a Solver that solves them, creating a self-evolving curriculum through their interaction.

Result: R-Zero notably enhances reasoning capabilities of LLMs, achieving significant improvements in math and general-domain reasoning benchmarks for models like Qwen3-4B-Base.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that fully autonomous systems like R-Zero can push Large Language Models toward greater capabilities without human intervention in task creation.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

*Dai Do,Manh Nguyen,Svetha Venkatesh,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPaRFT, a self-paced learning framework for efficient training of language models using optimized data selection strategies, reducing resource requirements while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in training large language models (LLMs), which require extensive data and computational resources, by proposing scalable and efficient methods for curriculum learning.

Method: SPaRFT combines cluster-based data reduction to partition training data by semantics and difficulty, and a multi-armed bandit approach to allocate training samples based on model performance.

Result: SPaRFT achieves accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning benchmarks, while using significantly fewer samples—up to 100x less.

Conclusion: Carefully designed performance-driven training curricula, using SPaRFT, can significantly reduce resource usage while maintaining or improving reasoning performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

*Zhehan Qu,Tianyi Hu,Christian Fronk,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies situational awareness (SA) in AR-guided CPR tasks, addressing risks like cognitive tunneling, and proposes an eye-tracking-based graph neural network model (FixGraphPool) to predict SA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the risk of cognitive tunneling in AR systems used for critical tasks like CPR, which could compromise user situational awareness and safety.

Method: The research used an AR app on Magic Leap 2 to deliver real-time CPR feedback, conducted user studies with simulated incidents, analyzed eye-tracking data, and introduced a graph neural network, FixGraphPool, to model SA from gaze data.

Result: Eye tracking metrics linked better SA with specific gaze patterns and demonstrated that FixGraphPool achieved an 83.0% accuracy in predicting SA, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Eye tracking data combined with advanced models like FixGraphPool can improve SA assessment in AR systems, ensuring better design and safer applications in critical scenarios.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

*Jinhyeok Jang,Jaehong Kim,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces KNOW prediction for generating enhanced pre-trained weights using structured forgetting and meta-learning, improving downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving pre-trained weight quality to encapsulate more knowledge and enhance performance in scenarios with limited data.

Method: Sequential fine-tuning with progressive dataset downsizing and structured forgetting modeling, combined with a hyper-model (KNOWN) for weight prediction.

Result: Enhanced pre-trained weights outperform naive fine-tuning and basic weight prediction across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: Structured forgetting dynamics can be reinterpreted to boost knowledge transfer in deep learning.

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

*Moshe Eliasof,Eldad Haber,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TANGO introduces a new graph representation learning approach using a learned energy landscape, ensuring stable node feature evolution, achieving strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning often struggles with issues like oversquashing and stability, necessitating novel approaches for effective signal propagation and feature evolution on graphs.

Method: TANGO leverages a learnable Lyapunov function and tangential components to govern node feature evolution, ensuring energy reduction and flexible dynamics through message-passing mechanisms.

Result: TANGO demonstrated strong performance on diverse benchmarks for node and graph classification, showcasing its advantages in learning energy functions and tangential flows.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust mechanism for stable and flexible graph representation learning, addressing key issues like oversquashing and compatibility with multiple neural backbones.

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

*Simin Huo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ULU is a novel activation function surpassing ReLU and Mish for classification and detection tasks, with an adaptable variant AULU enhancing model inductive bias measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing activation functions like ReLU and Mish by introducing a non-monotonic, piecewise approach.

Method: Introducing ULU and AULU activation functions, where ULU differentiates responses for positive and negative inputs, and AULU uses learnable parameters.

Result: Extensive experimental results show ULU and AULU outperform traditional activation functions in image classification and object detection tasks.

Conclusion: ULU and its adaptive variant AULU improve neural network performance and offer a new metric (LIB) for assessing inductive bias, paving the way for better activation function designs.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{ULU}, a novel non-monotonic, piecewise activation function
defined as $\{f(x;\alpha_1),x<0; f(x;\alpha_2),x>=0 \}$, where
$f(x;\alpha)=0.5x(tanh(\alpha x)+1),\alpha >0$. ULU treats positive and
negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU
significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object
detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as
$\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x<0; f(x;\beta_2^2),x>=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for
positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like
Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias
of the model.

### [235] [Integrated Influence: Data Attribution with Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05089)
*Linxiao Yang,Xinyu Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel data attribution method, Integrated Influence, which addresses limitations in existing LOO-based methods by considering collective influence and incorporating baseline datasets for flexible explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing LOO-based data attribution methods fail to consider collective influence within training sets and lack baselines for counterfactual explanations, limiting their effectiveness and flexibility.

Method: The proposed method defines a baseline dataset and uses a data degeneration process to transition the current dataset to the baseline, accumulating the influence of each training sample and offering a generalizable framework.

Result: Experimental results validate that Integrated Influence produces more reliable data attributions and outperforms existing methods in data attribution and mislabeled data identification tasks.

Conclusion: Integrated Influence improves upon existing data attribution methods by addressing their limitations, offering theoretical robustness, and enhancing interpretability in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

*Mojtaba Fayaz-Bakhsh,Danial Ataee,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address the cold-start problem in active preference learning by using a self-supervised pre-training phase followed by an active learning loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active preference learning is challenged by the cold-start problem, especially in data-constrained environments like social systems and economic analyses where labeled data is scarce and expensive.

Method: The proposed framework begins with a self-supervised pre-training phase that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate pseudo-labels. This is followed by an active learning phase that queries a simulated noisy oracle for additional labeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that the method outperforms standard active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled data pairs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates the cold-start problem in active preference learning, enhancing both sample efficiency and the practical applicability of the technique in constrained data scenarios.

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

*Tomoya Tate,Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework that utilizes complementary weak supervision signals for improved classification when labeled data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in real-world machine learning applications where accurate labeling is difficult and labeled data is scarce, through the use of Weakly Supervised Learning.

Method: The proposed method, SconfConfDiff Classification, incorporates two weak labeling types: similarity-confidence and confidence-difference, using unbiased risk estimators to enhance performance.

Result: The method achieves optimal convergence rates, robustness against label noise, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages diverse supervision signals, offering a promising solution for classification with limited labeled data.

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework to improve reasoning and policy optimization for function calling tasks in large language models, showing significant performance gains on established benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for function calling in large language models either rely on pattern matching (supervised fine-tuning) or are insufficiently capable of handling the complex structured action space (standard RL methods). There is a need for robust reasoning strategies in real-world LLM applications.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with strategic entropy-based exploration. This method includes a two-stage data preparation process using iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation to ensure high-quality training samples.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard with an 86.02% overall accuracy. It outperforms standard GRPO by up to 6% in multi-function scenarios, especially excelling in code-pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework enhances structured reasoning, exploration, and parameter verification in function calling tasks for large language models. Its success highlights the importance of structured language generation. Code, models, and datasets will be released publicly to benefit the research community.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in error-estimation theory for neural networks applied to PDEs and establish a theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

Method: The authors derive approximation rates for deep fully-connected neural networks in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, measuring errors in $W^{m,p}$-norms, and analyze their performance compared to numerical methods like finite element techniques.

Result: Deep neural networks exhibit superior approximation accuracy (super-convergence) for weak solutions of PDEs compared to classical methods, achieving better error rates.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks can effectively solve PDEs with higher-level accuracy, providing a robust alternative to classical numerical approaches and advancing scientific computing techniques.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

*Beicheng Xu,Wei Liu,Keyao Ding,Yupeng Lu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSEO is a framework designed for optimizing post-hoc stacking ensembles in AutoML by addressing limitations in traditional CASH methods that rely on fixed strategies for ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CASH methods optimize single models extensively but lack adaptability in the ensemble phase, limiting performance improvements for specific tasks.

Method: PSEO employs binary quadratic programming for base model selection, introduces mechanisms to enhance multi-layer stacking, and defines a hyperparameter space to optimize ensemble strategies.

Result: On 80 public datasets, PSEO demonstrated the best average test rank (2.96) when compared to 16 methods, including state-of-the-art AutoML and ensemble learning strategies.

Conclusion: PSEO effectively balances diversity and performance, adapts ensemble strategies to tasks, and outperforms existing methods, improving AutoML ensemble optimization.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops domain-driven metrics for RL and demonstrates them in the context of a rational ABM disease model to evaluate policy optimization scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized metrics for evaluating the performance of RL-based ABMs and RABMs, especially in complex and stochastic systems.

Method: The authors develop domain-driven metrics for RL based on state-of-the-art approaches and apply them to a rational ABM disease model to explore policy optimization in pandemic scenarios.

Result: The study successfully uses domain-driven rewards in combination with traditional and advanced metrics to evaluate simulation scenarios, showing their effectiveness in different situations like mask availability.

Conclusion: Domain-driven RL metrics can effectively complement existing metrics to assess RL-based ABMs and RABMs, especially in complex contexts like disease modeling.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

### [242] [pFedDSH: Enabling Knowledge Transfer in Personalized Federated Learning through Data-free Sub-Hypernetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05157)
*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces pFedDSH, a personalized federated learning framework designed for dynamic client onboarding, achieving robust performance and efficient resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of traditional personalized federated learning methods that assume static client participation, which does not align with real-world scenarios where clients join dynamically.

Method: The proposed method, pFedDSH, uses a central hypernetwork to generate personalized models for clients with embedding vectors, employs batch-specific masks for preserving knowledge, and utilizes a data-free replay strategy for knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that pFedDSH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in ensuring stability for existing clients, adaptability for new ones, and efficient neural resource utilization.

Conclusion: pFedDSH is a practical and efficient solution for dynamic client onboarding, offering significant improvements in client performance stability, adaptability, and privacy preservation in FL scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

*Jiaqi Wang,Zhengyu Ma,Xiongri Shen,Chenlin Zhou,Leilei Zhao,Han Zhang,Yi Zhong,Siqi Cai,Zhenxi Song,Zhiguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces S$^2$M-Former, a spiking framework enhancing auditory attention detection (AAD) via parallel branches that improve feature learning and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based AAD faces challenges in fully utilizing complementary features due to energy-efficiency demands, limiting its application in neuro-steered hearing devices.

Method: The novel framework employs a spike-driven symmetric design with modular spatial and frequency branches, utilizing token-channel mixers and lightweight 1D token operations for energy optimization.

Result: S$^2$M-Former achieves state-of-the-art decoding accuracy on three benchmarks (KUL, DTU, AV-GC-AAD) and reduces power consumption by 5.8x compared to ANN methods, while maintaining performance efficiency.

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former emerges as a promising, energy-efficient solution for AAD tasks, blending high performance with low-power consumption.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

*Mason Nakamura,Saaduddin Mahmud,Kyle H. Wray,Hamed Zamani,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIA, a method for aligning LLMs with user preferences effectively during inference without requiring expensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is essential for practical applications but current methods trade off performance for computational cost.

Method: HIA combines a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to preserve alignment quality while minimizing inference calls.

Result: Experimental results show that HIA outperforms standard inference methods like best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search under similar budgets.

Conclusion: HIA offers a scalable and practical solution for personalized LLM deployment, proving effective even under low inference budgets.

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A ResNet-based human activity recognition model was developed to detect both basic and everyday activities with high accuracy across multiple smartphone wear locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to develop a human activity recognition model for practical applications, focusing on accurately identifying activities like walking, running, standing, etc., even under varying smartphone placement conditions.

Method: The researchers trained a ResNet-based model using smartphone sensor data from healthy individuals and those with multiple sclerosis. The model's performance was evaluated using multiple datasets.

Result: The model achieved 98.4%-99.6% accuracy for gait/non-gait detection and outperformed a state-of-the-art model in everyday activity recognition, achieving accuracy improvements of 2.8% to 9.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR model is highly accurate and robust across different smartphone wear locations, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

*Luis Mandl,Dibyajyoti Nayak,Tim Ricken,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PITI-DeepONet, a physics-informed deep learning approach that outperforms traditional methods in solving time-dependent PDEs over extended horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like full rollout (FR) and autoregressive (AR) approaches fail due to poor generalization and error accumulation, respectively, in modeling time-dependent partial differential equations over long horizons.

Method: The proposed Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network (PITI-DeepONet) combines learning the time-derivative operator with classical time-stepping schemes. It uses both physics-informed and hybrid objectives and incorporates residual monitoring for prediction quality assessment.

Result: PITI-DeepONet demonstrates substantial performance improvements on benchmark PDE problems, reducing $
\mathcal{L}_2$ errors significantly compared to FR and AR methods, showing reductions of 84%, 79%, 87%, 98%, 42%, and 89% across various PDE types.

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet offers enhanced stability and accuracy in long-term PDE modeling, surpassing traditional methods and setting a foundation for reliable solutions for complex, time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

*Mengao Zhang,Jiayu Fu,Tanya Warrier,Yuwen Wang,Tianhui Tan,Ke-wei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs) specific to financial applications, and introduces a framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations using financial documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial applications demand high accuracy and reliability from LLMs due to the risks associated with numerical errors, and there is a lack of effective benchmarks tailored to financial tabular data.

Method: The authors propose a masked span prediction task for hallucination analysis, create automated datasets via masking strategies, and evaluate LLMs using data derived from S&P 500 annual reports.

Result: The study provides actionable insights into hallucination patterns of state-of-the-art financial LLMs, showcasing the effectiveness of the developed evaluation method.

Conclusion: This work contributes a scalable methodology for evaluating financial LLMs, helping to build more trustworthy and reliable Generative AI systems tailored for the financial industry.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

*Bin Liu,Yunfei Liu,Ziru Xu,Zhaoyu Zhou,Zhi Kou,Yeqiu Yang,Han Zhu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a framework to address the inconsistency between retrieval and ranking stages for online ads, significantly improving revenue and ad performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and inconsistency caused by the inability of the retrieval stage to access real-time bids, which negatively impacts platform revenue and advertiser outcomes.

Method: Propose the Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR) framework, integrating bid signals into retrieval scoring using monotonicity-constrained learning, multi-task distillation, near-line inference, and feature refinement.

Result: Experiments and deployment showed a 4.32% increase in platform revenue and a 22.2% lift in impressions for positively-operated ads on Alibaba's advertising platform.

Conclusion: BAR effectively resolves multi-stage inconsistencies in online advertising systems, enhancing economic outcomes and ad performance.

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

*Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid deep learning model combining LSTM, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer blocks, and attention mechanisms to accurately predict the Rate of Penetration (ROP) in drilling operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of traditional and basic machine learning models in predicting ROP due to the complexity and dynamics of drilling data.

Method: They developed a hybrid model integrating LSTM, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer blocks, and attention mechanisms to model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and feature importance.

Result: The model achieved superior performance on real-world drilling data with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, surpassing standalone and simpler hybrid models.

Conclusion: This innovative approach provides reliable real-time ROP prediction, enabling intelligent and cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

### [250] [DFW: A Novel Weighting Scheme for Covariate Balancing and Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05215)
*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW), a novel method for better estimating causal effects from observational data by improving weight stability and covariate balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selection bias in observational studies leads to imbalanced covariate distributions, making it challenging to estimate causal effects. Existing methods like inverse propensity weighting (IPW) suffer from weight instability and performance degradation under high variance conditions.

Method: The authors propose DFW, which prioritizes less-confounded samples and mitigates the effect of highly-confounded ones. The method ensures bounded weights, reduced variance, and better covariate balance. It is formulated for binary treatments and extends to multi-treatment settings via the deconfounding factor.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that DFW consistently outperforms methods like IPW and CBPS in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: DFW improves the simulation of randomized controlled trials by addressing key limitations of existing propensity score weighting techniques, providing more stable and reliable treatment effect estimates.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: Machine learning allows effective prediction of physical performance scores using questionnaire data, aiding early intervention in older adults.

Abstract: Effective slowing down of older adults\' physical capacity deterioration

algorithms tested included Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, dense and
TabNet neural networks. The best results were achieved for the XGBoost (mean

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIGHTYEAR, a decentralized peer-to-peer federated learning framework, addressing the limitations of traditional centralized architectures and enhancing robustness, personalization, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized federated learning systems face challenges like a single point of failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness, particularly under non-IID data and adversarial conditions. A decentralized approach can address these shortcomings.

Method: The authors propose a P2P FL framework named LIGHTYEAR. It uses an agreement score computed on a local validation set to guide update selection and aggregation. A regularization term is also incorporated to stabilize training.

Result: LIGHTYEAR consistently outperformed centralized and existing P2P FL methods on two datasets, particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR provides a robust, personalized, and effective decentralized learning alternative to centralized federated learning, with superior performance under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

TL;DR: Cross-LoRA is a framework that makes LoRA modules transferable between diverse large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional training data, addressing the architectural constraints of traditional PEFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PEFT methods like LoRA are limited in their cross-model applicability due to their dependency on specific model architectures.

Method: Cross-LoRA introduces two components: (a) LoRA-Align, which uses SVD and a linear transformation for subspace alignment, and (b) LoRA-Shift, which projects aligned weight updates to the target model's parameter space. Both methods are training-free and data-free.

Result: Cross-LoRA demonstrates relative performance improvements of up to 5.26% over base models and maintains parity with trained LoRA adapters on commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA provides an efficient and architecture-agnostic solution for transferring LoRA modules, enabling broader usability and requiring minimal computational resources.

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

*Xiaodong Chen,Mingming Ha,Zhenzhong Lan,Jing Zhang,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based language models require substantial memory for deployment, and existing compression methods lead to significant accuracy drops, motivating the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: The authors propose decomposing up/gate weight matrices in experts as W = AB, where matrix A is expert-specific, and matrix B is shared and expressed as a linear combination of shared basis matrices {Bi}. Reconstruction error minimization is used to learn the factorization.

Result: Experiments show that MoBE reduces parameter counts by 24%-30% for models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Kimi-K2-Instruct while incurring only 1%-2% accuracy drop (2% relatively).

Conclusion: The MoBE method achieves substantial compression of large MoE-based language models with minimal impact on accuracy, improving deployment feasibility.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

*Zhouyao Qian,Yang Chen,Baodian Li,Shuyi Zhang,Zhen Tian,Gongsen Wang,Tianyue Gu,Xinyu Zhou,Huilin Chen,Xinyi Li,Hao Zhu,Shuyao Zhang,Zongheng Li,Siyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid LSTM-RF model for predicting marine chlorophyll concentrations, showing improved accuracy compared to single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine chlorophyll concentration is crucial for ecosystem health and carbon cycle studies, and accurate predictions are needed for applications like red tide warnings.

Method: A hybrid model combining LSTM and RF methodologies was developed, trained with multi-source ocean data using standardization and sliding window techniques.

Result: The LSTM-RF model achieved better predictive metrics (R^2 = 0.5386, MSE = 0.005806, MAE = 0.057147) compared to standalone LSTM and RF models.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances time-series modeling and nonlinear feature capture, offering an innovative solution for frequent prediction of marine ecological variables.

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

*Lars Graf,Thomas Ortner,Stanisław Woźniak,Angeliki Pantazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowState, a novel time series foundation model, addresses the limitations of existing models by leveraging a state space model-based encoder and a functional basis decoder, achieving state-of-the-art results with a smaller, more efficient design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting models struggle with generalization across context and target lengths, adaptability to varying sampling rates, and computational efficiency, highlighting the need for a more versatile and efficient solution.

Method: FlowState introduces a state space model encoder and a functional basis decoder, enabling continuous-time modeling, dynamic time-scale adjustment, and efficient adaptation to varying sampling rates without extensive training data.

Result: FlowState achieves state-of-the-art performance on GIFT-ZS and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, surpassing larger models while requiring less data and computational resources.

Conclusion: FlowState represents a significant step forward for time series forecasting, combining robust adaptability, efficiency, and precision, validated through superior benchmark performance and ablation studies.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

*Zhongheng Yang,Aijia Sun,Yushang Zhao,Yinuo Yang,Dannier Li,Chengrui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align conversational recommender systems based on large language models (LLMs) to user preferences, addressing implicit feedback signals like sentiment or engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches fail to capture implicit user feedback, thus motivating the need for a solution that maximizes user-centric utility in multi-turn conversational contexts.

Method: The authors propose RLHF-based fine-tuning using a reward model $R_{\phi}$ trained on weakly-labeled engagement data, combined with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to refine the LLM $M_{\theta}$. Conversational state transitions guide item recommendations.

Result: Evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets like REDIAL and OpenDialKG shows improved top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively aligns implicit signals using RLHF, showcasing potential for scalable and adaptive CRS design.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to
(arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give
up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in

*Hikaru Umeda,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in large-batch training for deep learning by theoretically and experimentally optimizing batch-size and learning-rate scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance efficiency and convergence in deep learning by addressing naive hyperparameter scheduling that hinders optimization and generalization.

Method: The authors used stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity analysis to derive optimal batch-size and learning-rate schedules, and validated them through experiments.

Result: Optimal growth schedules were theoretically derived and experimentally validated, reducing SFO complexity and improving training efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training, enhancing deep learning optimization and generalization.

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing mini-batch SGD by introducing an adaptive scheduling strategy based on critical batch size to improve convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of SGD's convergence on batch size and learning rate, and leverage identified critical batch size to improve convergence performance.

Method: Developed an adaptive scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts batch size and learning rate based on full gradient norm decay.

Result: The adaptive joint scheduler showcased improved convergence speed in experiments compared to existing schedulers.

Conclusion: Incorporating a theoretical understanding of critical batch size into SGD scheduling enhances convergence performance effectively.

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

*Yue Duan,Taicai Chen,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces USP, a framework for semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that improves learning plasticity (LP), unlabeled learning (UL), and memory stability (MS) effectively through three innovative strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in SSCL, which include leveraging labeled and unlabeled data sequentially while balancing memory stability, learning plasticity, and effective learning from unlabeled data.

Method: The USP framework consists of three components: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) for constructing reserved feature locations, (2) Divide-and-Conquer Pseudo-labeling (DCP) for reliable pseudo-label assignments, and (3) Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) to stabilize class means and prevent forgetting.

Result: USP demonstrated superior performance, achieving improvements of up to 5.94% in the final accuracy compared to prior methods in comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The USP framework synergizes innovations in LP, UL, and MS, establishing a new benchmark in SSCL and validating its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

*Feiyu Wang,Guoan Wang,Yihao Zhang,Shengfan Wang,Weitao Li,Bokai Huang,Shimao Chen,Zihan Jiang,Rui Xu,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fairy±i, a 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs, which surpasses the accuracy ceiling of full-precision models and improves computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT research aims at minimizing quantization error but remains bound by the accuracy of full-precision models (accuracy ceiling), limiting the potential of extremely low-bit representations.

Method: The proposed Fairy±i framework uses complex numbers mapped to the fourth roots of unity {±1, ±i}, ensuring symmetric, optimal representations and enabling multiplication-free inference via additions and element swaps.

Result: Fairy±i achieves superior accuracy on both PPL and downstream tasks compared to existing 2-bit quantization models, while maintaining efficient storage and computation.

Conclusion: Fairy±i breaks conventional accuracy ceilings for QAT by utilizing complex-valued representations, setting a new standard for accurate and efficient LLMs under low-bit constraints.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

### [262] [Optimal Corpus Aware Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05364)
*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT), an approach to fine-tune models trained with Corpus Aware Training (CAT), leading to improved translation accuracy while being lightweight and less sensitive to hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Corpus Aware Training (CAT) requires pre-defining a group of high-quality data before training, which can lead to inefficiency and errors.

Method: The proposed method, OCAT, fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most model parameters and only updating corpus-related parameters.

Result: With OCAT, translation models show a +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement for WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation tasks, respectively. OCAT achieves comparable or slightly better performance than other fine-tuning techniques.

Conclusion: OCAT is a lightweight, effective, and resilient fine-tuning approach that boosts translation model accuracy with less sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) for clinical phenotypes, demonstrating the effectiveness of a novel iterative learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess whether large language models can accurately and concisely generate computable phenotypes for clinical applications, aiming to improve decision support systems for conditions like hypertension.

Method: The authors tested the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and introduced a strategy called "synthesize, execute, debug, instruct," which leverages iterative refinement based on data-driven feedback for generating CPs.

Result: The study found that LLMs, combined with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably accurate programs, approaching the performance of advanced machine learning methods while using fewer training data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs, with iterative refinement, hold promise for scalable and interpretable clinical applications, offering efficient medical decision-making tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

### [264] [Latent Preference Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05367)
*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a relaxed approach to latent bandits that models only preference ordering instead of the full reward distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration in bandit algorithms can be costly in personalization tasks where only a few decisions are made, making the need for efficient approaches evident.

Method: They propose a model that relies on the preference ordering of actions in latent states rather than full reward distribution, and design a posterior-sampling algorithm for the problem.

Result: Their algorithm performs competitively with traditional latent bandits when reward distributions are well-specified and outperforms them when reward scales vary across instances.

Conclusion: A preference ordering-based approach to latent bandits is both practical and effective, particularly in cases of heterogeneous reward scales across instances.

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo is a novel RL system designed to separate trajectory sampling and policy optimization for efficiency in large-scale LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies caused by RL workflows switching between inference and training on the same GPU cluster in modern LLM systems.

Method: Echo leverages two synchronization protocols: sequential pull mode for minimal bias and asynchronous push-pull mode for optimized rollouts.

Result: Echo matches co-located baseline convergence speed and rewards while effectively utilizing decentralized resources.

Conclusion: Echo enables datacentre-grade RL performance for LLMs using heterogeneous, distributed hardware.

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes NT-ML, a novel defense mechanism for mitigating backdoor attacks in deep neural networks, which outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of deep neural networks to backdoor attacks, where triggers in the dataset cause incorrect predictions.

Method: The NT-ML method involves two stages: NT retrains the model using outputs from standard training to create high-performing teacher and student models, and ML improves the model by mutual learning between these two models.

Result: NT-ML effectively mitigates backdoor attacks, defending against 6 types of attacks while requiring only a small set of clean samples. It outperforms 5 current backdoor defense methods.

Conclusion: The proposed defense mechanism, NT-ML, demonstrates strong performance and effectiveness in purifying poisoned models and improving resilience against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

*Asma Atamna,Tom Maus,Fabian Kievelitz,Tobias Glasmachers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reevaluates and corrects a 2017 adaptive learning rate mechanism for Adam to improve consistency and benchmarks its performance to assess its practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ideal learning rate is challenging to set in deep learning and may change during training, prompting the need for adaptive methods responsive to the loss landscape.

Method: The authors revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme, identify inconsistencies in its application to Adam, propose a corrected version, and run benchmarks comparing its performance against other methods.

Result: Benchmarks highlight when adaptive learning rate strategies provide benefits, offering insights into their utility in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: The corrected adaptation mechanism for Adam improves consistency and helps clarify practical advantages and limitations of adaptive learning rate strategies in deep learning.

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework for molecular generation using text descriptions, focusing on quality, diversity, and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for molecular generation struggle to balance output quality, diversity, and computational efficiency, creating a need for innovative approaches.

Method: The work proposes a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) for encoding molecular graphs and text, and a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework for efficient one-step inference using a latent space modeled as a mixture of Gaussians.

Result: The proposed model achieves higher novelty (up to 74.5%), diversity (up to 70.3%), and 100% validity in molecular generation experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with fewer computations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant improvement in molecular generation, providing a computationally efficient solution for producing high-quality and diverse molecules.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

*Jiansheng Rao,Jiayi Li,Zhizhi Gong,Soummya Kar,Haoxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CR-FMOL, a method to enhance client fairness in federated learning by enforcing client-wise Pareto optimality using preference-cone constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving fairness in federated learning for minority clients due to the limitations of traditional methods like FedAvg and FMOL.

Method: Introducing Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL), which uses a novel preference-cone constraint to ensure Pareto-stationary points for individual clients.

Result: CR-FMOL demonstrates enhanced fairness in federally distributed systems, with competitive performance compared to FedAvg over extended training rounds.

Conclusion: CR-FMOL effectively addresses client fairness in federated learning, providing a promising alternative to existing methods like FedAvg.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training

### [270] [Group Causal Policy Optimization for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05428)
*Ziyin Gu,Jingyao Wang,Ran Zuo,Chuxiong Sun,Zeen Song,Changwen Zheng,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCPO, an improvement over GRPO, integrating causality to optimize large language models for specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have broad utility, specialized domains require fine-tuned optimization methods. GRPO succeeds in efficiency but fails to consider semantic interactions between response candidates.

Method: The authors present a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to address dependencies and propose GCPO, incorporating causally informed reward adjustment and KL regularization for optimization.

Result: GCPO outperformed GRPO and other methods across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved prediction quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating causality into policy optimization can enhance efficiency and accuracy in post-training large language models for specialized tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

### [271] [Competing Risks: Impact on Risk Estimation and Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05435)
*Vincent Jeanselme,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the biases introduced in survival estimates when competing risks are treated as censoring, and it emphasizes the resultant fairness implications, particularly in the medical field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the consequences of treating competing risks as censoring in survival analysis models, which can lead to systematic bias and amplified disparities.

Method: The paper formalizes the problem of misclassification, quantifies the bias introduced in survival estimates, develops a framework to measure the predictive and fairness implications, and conducts an empirical analysis in cardiovascular management.

Result: Treating competing risks as censoring leads to substantial errors in survival estimates, disproportionately affecting those most at risk and aggravating demographic disparities in predictive performance.

Conclusion: Accounting for competing risks is essential to enhance the accuracy of survival models, reduce disparities, and make more equitable and informed decisions across risk stratifications.

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

### [272] [Tail-Risk-Safe Monte Carlo Tree Search under PAC-Level Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05441)
*Zuyuan Zhang,Arnob Ghosh,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces new algorithms, CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS, for Monte Carlo Tree Search that explicitly account for extreme or high-risk adverse outcomes, offering robust tail-risk guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monte Carlo Tree Search often fails to consider extreme or high-risk adverse outcomes, which can lead to serious consequences in high-stake scenarios.

Method: The authors propose two methods: CVaR-MCTS embeds the Conditional Value-at-Risk measure to control tail-risk explicitly, and W-MCTS incorporates Wasserstein ambiguity sets to address estimation bias in tail-risk.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated superior performance over existing baselines by effectively ensuring tail-risk guarantees while improving rewards and stability in simulated environments.

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS provide rigorous safety and performance guarantees, making them viable solutions for decision-making under risk in MCTS applications.

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

*Wei Li,Zixin Wang,Qizheng Sun,Qixiang Gao,Fenglei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnergyPatchTST, a robust method for energy time series prediction with multi-scale feature extraction and better uncertainty estimation, reducing prediction error by 7-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for energy time series prediction struggle with multi-scale time dynamics and data irregularities, necessitating more reliable approaches for power generation planning.

Method: The paper presents a novel deep learning model, EnergyPatchTST, incorporating multi-scale feature extraction, Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation, integration of future variables, and pre-training for enhanced performance.

Result: Experiments reveal that EnergyPatchTST outperforms traditional methods, achieving 7-12% lower prediction errors and providing reliable uncertainty estimations.

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST is a significant advancement for energy time series forecasting, offering higher accuracy and reliability, thus aiding in effective decision-making for power generation.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

### [274] [Task complexity shapes internal representations and robustness in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05463)
*Robert Jankowski,Filippo Radicchi,M. Ángeles Serrano,Marián Boguñá,Santo Fortunato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how the complexity of tasks influences the structure and robustness of internal representations in neural networks, focusing on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and introducing several methods to analyze their behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the opacity in neural network internals, particularly how input complexity and task difficulty shape their learned representations.

Method: Five data-agnostic probes are introduced—pruning, binarization, noise injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization—to study MLPs as signed, weighted bipartite graphs.

Result: Harder tasks significantly affect robustness; for instance, binarization degrades performance dramatically in hard tasks but not in easier ones. Noise injection can improve accuracy in certain cases, and the topology (rather than exact weights) is crucial for maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The study establishes a novel, task-complexity-dependent model evaluation method and suggests that the preserved sign structure in neural networks offers routes for model compression and better interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

### [275] [Let's Measure Information Step-by-Step: LLM-Based Evaluation Beyond Vibes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05469)
*Zachary Robertson,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for assessing AI systems without ground truth by using gaming-resistant mechanisms based on f-mutual information, achieving higher robustness compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating AI systems in situations where there is no ground truth available, seeking reliable and robust assessment methods resistant to manipulation.

Method: The study employs f-mutual information measures as a gaming-resistant mechanism under certain conditions, supports findings with ten empirical domains, and introduces performance metrics using information theory.

Result: The authors prove that f-mutual information uniquely achieves gaming resistance, shows better robustness (10-100x) than existing evaluation practices, and outlines an optimal balance between compression and performance.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust evaluation mechanism for AI systems without requiring ground truth, with superior resistance to adversarial manipulation and clear guidelines for performance optimization.

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

### [276] [Prediction of Survival Outcomes under Clinical Presence Shift: A Joint Neural Network Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05472)
*Vincent Jeanselme,Glen Martin,Matthew Sperrin,Niels Peek,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model that accounts for clinical interaction dynamics to improve performance and transportability of clinical prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical prediction models overlook 'clinical presence,' limiting performance and adaptability across healthcare settings.

Method: A multi-task recurrent neural network is developed to jointly model inter-observation times, missingness processes, and survival outcomes.

Result: The proposed model shows improved performance and transportability in a real-world mortality prediction task using the MIMIC-III dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical presence into models enhances their utility and adaptability across diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoMA, an innovative architecture utilizing multiple specialized large language models (LLMs) to process multimodal EHR data for improved clinical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical prediction models struggle to effectively integrate multimodal EHR data due to its diverse and complex nature.

Method: MoMA employs specialist LLMs to process non-textual EHR modalities into textual summaries, combines these via an aggregator LLM, and uses a predictor LLM to generate clinical predictions.

Result: MoMA demonstrates superior performance in three clinical prediction tasks with multimodal data, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in various settings.

Conclusion: The MoMA architecture successfully integrates diverse EHR modalities for clinical prediction, providing both higher accuracy and greater task versatility.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes algorithms AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U for multi-view clustering, overcoming issues like manual parameter tuning and lack of cross-view integration by using parameter-free entropy and signal-to-noise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view clustering approaches struggle with issues such as high-dimensional features, irrelevant information, manual parameter tuning, and lack of effective cross-view integration.

Method: Two algorithms, AMVFCM-U and its extension AAMVFCM-U, are introduced. They utilize entropy-based regularization for adaptive consensus, signal-to-noise ratio for feature weighting, and hierarchical dimensionality reduction for view and feature optimization.

Result: The proposed methods outperform 15 other state-of-the-art methods on diverse benchmarks, achieving up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reducing dimensionality to 0.45% of its original size, and identifying optimal view combinations.

Conclusion: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U address key multi-view clustering challenges by providing a parameter-free, efficient, and robust solution for automatic pattern discovery across heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

*Hrithik Suresh,Sahil Sidheekh,Vishnu Shreeram M. P,Sriraam Natarajan,Narayanan C. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hessian-based regularizer to reduce overfitting in Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) by guiding them towards flatter optima during training, thereby improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements have enabled deep and expressive PCs, but these models often face overfitting, especially with limited data. This is attributed to convergence towards sharp optima that perform poorly on unseen data.

Method: The paper introduces a Hessian trace-based sharpness proxy that is computationally efficient for PCs. It minimizes this trace to generate a gradient-norm-based regularizer, leading to parameter updates that can be incorporated into both EM and gradient-based methods for training PCs.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that minimizing the Hessian trace consistently improves the generalization performance of PCs and steers them to flatter optima.

Conclusion: By efficiently leveraging the Hessian trace, the proposed method mitigates overfitting and improves the generalization capabilities of Probabilistic Circuits in various training scenarios.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

TL;DR: The paper surveys unsupervised adaptation techniques for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing methods into four paradigms based on unlabeled data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have strong generalization capability but often fail in specialized tasks without adaptation. Unsupervised methods offer a way to enhance performance without relying on labeled data.

Method: The paper categorizes unsupervised VLM adaptation methods into four paradigms: Data-Free Transfer, Unsupervised Domain Transfer, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation, and Online Test-Time Adaptation, based on types of unlabeled visual data.

Result: It provides a taxonomy, analyses adaptation strategies, reviews benchmarks, and discusses challenges and future research directions.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap in understanding unsupervised VLM adaptation and offers a structured overview to guide future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension for PyKEEN, a popular framework for Knowledge Graph Embeddings, adding advanced negative sampling strategies to improve performance on tasks like link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative sampling is crucial for training embedding models for Knowledge Graphs but existing frameworks lack advanced solutions.

Method: The authors integrated multiple advanced negative sampling strategies into the PyKEEN framework, maintaining compatibility with existing workflows.

Result: The extension enhances PyKEEN and improves link prediction tasks, with an empirical study showcasing its impact.

Conclusion: The extension not only boosts PyKEEN's utility but provides insights for developing better negative sampling methods.

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

*Thorsten Peinemann,Paula Arnold,Sebastian Berndt,Thomas Eisenbarth,Esfandiar Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of backdoor attacks using a single poison sample under the one-poison hypothesis, demonstrating its feasibility without degrading benign task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unanswered question regarding the minimal amount of poisoned data needed for a successful backdoor attack.

Method: The paper formulates the one-poison hypothesis, provides proofs for linear regression and classification cases, and validates findings with experiments on benchmark datasets.

Result: The study demonstrates that a single poison sample can inject a backdoor with zero error while maintaining benign task performance.

Conclusion: Backdoor attacks can be successfully executed even with minimal poison data, provided specific conditions are met.

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shuffle-R1, a framework aiming to optimize RL fine-tuning efficiency for multimodal large language models by addressing Advantage Collapsing and Rollout Silencing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models suffer from inefficiencies in reinforcement learning fine-tuning caused by data-related issues, which limit gradient updates and impact learning efficiency.

Method: Shuffle-R1 employs Pairwise Trajectory Sampling to select trajectories with large advantages and Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle for informed batch restructuring.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated consistent improvement over strong RL baselines across various reasoning benchmarks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Data-centric adaptations like Shuffle-R1 can significantly improve efficiency in RL training for large language models, emphasizing the importance of better batch and trajectory management.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) to enhance the generalization of large language models (LLMs) during supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for LLMs suffers from limited generalization, which the authors identify as stemming from a problematic reward structure encoded in SFT gradients.

Method: The proposed method, Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), involves a dynamic rescaling of the objective function for each token based on its probability, which stabilizes gradient updates.

Result: DFT outperforms standard SFT across multiple benchmarks and base models, significantly improving generalization, and achieves competitive performance in offline reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: DFT offers a simple, effective improvement over standard SFT, advancing its generalization and bridging theoretical insights with practical applications.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

*Michael R. Wartmann,B. Erik Ydstie*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating data-driven methods with classical process models, using a framework based on topology and conservation principles, demonstrated through a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for dynamic system control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between traditional process control models and emerging data-driven machine learning techniques, addressing the challenge of integrating these two approaches seamlessly.

Method: The proposed framework integrates process modeling with topological properties and conservation laws, leveraging sparse deep neural networks and neural ODEs to learn system dynamics from synthetic time-series data. This allows the creation of a unified state space model.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates its application in a simple inventory control system, showing that neural ODEs can learn constitutive equations from data and integrate them with process topology for predictive control purposes.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential to combine data-driven algorithms with classical control theories by preserving physical constraints and topological properties, improving distributed control and optimization in process networks.

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

### [287] [Modelling the emergence of open-ended technological evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04828)
*James Winters,Mathieu Charbonneau*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores how human societies achieve open-ended technological evolution through the co-evolution of technological systems and search spaces, revealing that such growth is rare and contingent on specific dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying factors enabling societies to achieve continual, open-ended technological progress and resource expansion.

Method: Develop a macro-level model of technological systems and search spaces, applying cultural evolutionary dynamics characterized by stochastic and selection-like processes.

Result: Open-ended technological growth is rare and historically contingent, requiring a balance between randomness and selective effectiveness in the interaction between technological systems and search spaces.

Conclusion: Effective technological systems and expanded search spaces, sustained by specific co-evolutionary dynamics, are crucial for open-ended technological evolution and resource provision.

Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and
cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness
provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and
to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a
collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from
the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of
interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the
aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting
from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological
systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By
manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic
or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely
rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and
search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to
continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas
selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained
production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains
effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search
space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended
technological evolution.

*Atharva Gondhalekar,Kjetil Haugen,Thomas Gibson,Wu-chun Feng*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fine-grained domain decomposition method to improve the performance of GPU-based sparse linear system solving, achieving significant speedups on AMD GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address bottlenecks caused by irregular memory accesses and data dependencies in preconditioned sparse triangular solves, especially for GPU architectures.

Method: The authors present a fine-grained domain decomposition strategy generating non-overlapping subdomains. These are assigned to thread blocks and sized to fit into GPU shared memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory access irregularities.

Result: The approach led to a 10.7× speedup for triangular solves and a 3.2× speedup for the ILU0-preconditioned BiCGSTAB solver on the AMD Instinct MI210 GPU.

Conclusion: Fine-grained domain decomposition improves parallelism, minimizes synchronization needs, and enhances overall GPU performance for preconditioned sparse linear system solving.

Abstract: Sparse linear systems are typically solved using preconditioned iterative
methods, but applying preconditioners via sparse triangular solves introduces
bottlenecks due to irregular memory accesses and data dependencies. This work
leverages fine-grained domain decomposition to adapt triangular solves to the
GPU architecture. We develop a fine-grained domain decomposition strategy that
generates non-overlapping subdomains, increasing parallelism in the application
of preconditioner at the expense of a modest increase in the iteration count
for convergence. Each subdomain is assigned to a thread block and is sized such
that the subdomain vector fits in the GPU shared memory, eliminating the need
for inter-block synchronization and reducing irregular global memory accesses.
Compared to other state-of-the-art implementations using the ROCm$^{\text{TM}}$
software stack, we achieve a 10.7$\times$ speedup for triangular solves and a
3.2$\times$ speedup for the ILU0-preconditioned biconjugate gradient stabilized
(BiCGSTAB) solver on the AMD Instinct$^{\text{TM}}$ MI210 GPU.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new performance metric for computing systems based on information theory, aiming to better account for diverse modern computing paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computing performance metrics like FLOPs fail to capture the complexity of modern systems which include low-precision formats, specialized hardware, and new paradigms such as analog or quantum computing.

Method: The paper models computing as transforming information through a channel and defines performance using the mutual information between system inputs and outputs.

Result: The proposed framework evaluates computing systems' performance based on meaningful information encoded, processed, and retained, rather than sheer data quantity.

Conclusion: This principled, implementation-neutral metric offers a universal approach for assessing computing performance across diverse and emerging technologies.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel computing performance unit grounded in information
theory. Modern computing systems are increasingly diverse, supporting
low-precision formats, hardware specialization, and emerging paradigms such as
analog, quantum, and reversible logic. Traditional metrics like floating-point
operations (flops) no longer accurately capture this complexity. We frame
computing as the transformation of information through a channel and define
performance in terms of the mutual information between a system's inputs and
outputs. This approach measures not just the quantity of data processed, but
the amount of meaningful information encoded, manipulated, and retained through
computation. Our framework provides a principled, implementation-agnostic
foundation for evaluating performance.

### [290] [Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829)
*Devora Chait-Roth,Kedar S. Namjoshi,Thomas Wies*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining system consistency during service updates in scalable microservice architectures, presenting algorithms that guarantee consistency in mixed-mode updates by leveraging semantic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the problem of service inconsistencies caused by mixed-mode updates when scaling microservice architectures. Traditional update methods suffer from inefficiency or potential failures during uncontrolled rolling updates.

Method: The authors developed algorithms that utilize semantic properties such as commutativity in service actions to guarantee consistent mixed-mode updates. They also formalized a framework to ensure updates appear atomic to clients.

Result: The paper proves that semantically oblivious methods cannot guarantee consistency and demonstrates the correctness of semantically-aware algorithms. Foundational theory and a formal framework were developed to address mixed-mode update inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The proposed semantics-aware algorithms ensure consistent and efficient updates in microservice architectures, solving a significant limitation of traditional update processes.

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

### [291] [On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines how a robot sharing reactions with humans and using specific timing impacts human perceptions of its affective behavior, concluding optimal reaction times for different goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance robot functionality in social contexts by investigating the impact of robots sharing reactions with humans.

Method: Two experimental setups were used: one focused on affective robot expressions and the other assessed reaction timing delays in physical encounters.

Result: Statistically significant changes in perceived affective impact were observed when robots shared reactions with humans, with optimal delays identified for enhancing perceived robot-human interaction.

Conclusion: Ideal reaction timings were determined: ~200ms for maximizing human observer impact and ~100ms for emphasizing the robot's responsiveness.

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

TL;DR: This paper proposes INTENTION, a framework combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and interaction-driven memory to enable robots to perform intuitive and adaptable autonomous manipulation tasks in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic control is limited by its reliance on precise models and predefined actions, which struggle in real-world, dynamic scenarios. This motivates the development of a more intuitive and adaptable robotic framework inspired by human interaction.

Method: A novel framework, INTENTION, is introduced. It integrates Vision-Language Models for scene reasoning with a Memory Graph that captures past task interactions and an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from scenes.

Result: The framework enables robots to generalize and perform manipulation tasks in diverse scenarios, overcoming the need for repetitive instructions or rigid models.

Conclusion: INTENTION empowers robots with human-like adaptability and decision-making, enabling efficient and intuitive autonomous manipulation in dynamic and novel environments.

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

### [293] [Optimal Planning for Multi-Robot Simultaneous Area and Line Coverage Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04981)
*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of efficient and collision-free robot routing for dual tasks of linear feature coverage and area survey. It introduces the Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation (HCMR) algorithm to achieve optimal planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving efficiency and conflict-free operation of robots tasked with both linear feature coverage and complete area exploration, where these roles have different operational costs.

Method: The HCMR algorithm uses cyclic merging search and edge sequence backpropagation, regulated by balanced partitioning, to identify optimal paths satisfying constraints. Morse theory supports its analysis.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements using HCMR, including a minimum of 10.0% better path length, a 16.9% reduction in task time, and assurance of collision-free operation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed HCMR algorithm proves optimal under fixed sweep direction in multi-robot path planning, enhancing efficiency and reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of robotic maze navigation using a hierarchical structure to overcome the limitations of standard DDPG in sparse reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve robotic maze navigation performance by addressing sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning issues in DDPG.

Method: The proposed HDDPG algorithm integrates high-level and low-level policies, uses off-policy correction, adaptive noise exploration, intrinsic-extrinsic rewards, and other optimizations.

Result: HDDPG improved the success rate by at least 56.59% and increased average rewards by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline algorithms in simulations.

Conclusion: The HDDPG algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of DDPG in maze navigation, demonstrating significant performance improvements in terms of success rate and rewards.

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a navigation approach for robots that utilizes Visual Language Models enhanced with active viewpoint adjustment and memory mechanisms, excelling in unknown environments with natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a need for robots to navigate complex environments effectively based solely on natural language descriptions, overcoming challenges of ambiguous and incomplete visual inputs.

Method: The paper presents a framework integrating Visual Language Models with two mechanisms: active perspective adjustment for better visual grounding and memory backtracking for improved decision-making.

Result: The proposed system, tested on HM3D and real-world deployments with quadruped robots, surpasses state-of-the-art object navigation methods and demonstrates generalization in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Enhancing Visual Language Models with active grounding and memory enables effective robot navigation in diverse settings without requiring data labeling or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of improving multi-robot arm motion planning using shortcutting techniques, analyzing their performance, and proposing improved strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-arm robot systems face challenges like high dimensionality and inter-arm collision risks, making traditional motion planning methods suboptimal for smoothness and execution time.

Method: The paper conducts a study to compare existing shortcutting techniques for multi-arm trajectories, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and proposes new hybrid strategies for improved results.

Result: The study provides a quantitative comparison of shortcutting methods and introduces two combined strategies to optimize the tradeoff between performance and runtime in multi-arm motion planning.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding of shortcutting methods for multi-arm systems, offering valuable guidelines and tools for optimizing motion planning in complex robotic setups.

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Result: Experiments confirmed real-time collision detection with accurate identification of direction and scale.

Conclusion: The system effectively maintains stable grasping by detecting and responding to external collisions.

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping

Motivation: To enhance human-robot interaction by making robot actions more legible, thereby improving human ability to interpret and predict robot intentions while feeling safe.

Method: Using the NICO humanoid robot, an experiment was conducted where participants observed arm movements towards screen targets under different cue conditions (gaze, pointing, and their combinations), with trajectories stopped early (60% or 80%) to test predictions.

Result: Findings supported the multimodal superiority hypothesis, which posits that combining cues improves perception, and the ocular primacy hypothesis, which highlights the dominance of gaze cues in predicting intent.

Conclusion: Gaze and multimodal cues enhance the legibility of robotic movements, helping humans better interpret and predict robot intentions.

Abstract: Human--robot interaction requires robots whose actions are legible, allowing
humans to interpret, predict, and feel safe around them. This study
investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated
movements and bodily cues. We designed an experiment using the NICO humanoid
robot, where participants observed its arm movements towards targets on a
touchscreen. Robot cues varied across conditions: gaze, pointing, and pointing
with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software

revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote

Result: Chemist Eye achieved a 97% accuracy in spotting safety hazards and a 95% performance rate in decision-making using real-world data from an SDL with three mobile robots.

Conclusion: Chemist Eye can greatly enhance safety and situational awareness in self-driving laboratories, addressing critical risks effectively while ensuring real-time integration and human-robot coordination.

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

*Mohammed Daba,Jing Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FCBV-Net enhances robotic garment smoothing by using frozen geometric features for better category-level generalization, outperforming previous methods in simulated experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic garment manipulation remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and intra-category variability. Existing methods struggle with either overfitting or insufficient action value prediction.

Method: FCBV-Net leverages pre-trained geometric features from 3D point clouds to condition action value learning, separating visual feature extraction from policy training.

Result: FCBV-Net showed significant category-level generalization, achieving 89% coverage in unseen garments compared to an 83% baseline and reducing efficiency drops to 11.5% versus 96.2% for image-based methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling geometric feature understanding from action value learning enhances category-level generalization, providing a robust approach to robotic garment manipulation.

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), integrating active view planning and task-specific visual encoding to enhance 3D perception, reduce interference, and improve robotic manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in vision-language-action robotic models caused by static viewpoints and shared encoders, which lead to poor 3D perception, task interference, and hindered robustness.

Method: TAVP combines active view planning, an efficient exploration policy utilizing a pseudo-environment, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to create task-specific representations.

Result: The model generates better visual representations and achieves significantly improved action prediction on RLBench tasks compared to fixed-view approaches.

Conclusion: TAVP enhances 3D perception, reduces task interference, and improves generalization in multi-task robotic manipulation, offering a significant advancement over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous robots engage young audiences and identify challenges in human-robot interactions within performative arts settings.

Method: Observation-based analysis of 18 children's interactions with the robotic performer NED in a public art installation.

Result: The study identified key challenges in engagement, expressivity, reciprocity, and unmet expectations during child-robot interactions.

Conclusion: Optimizing HRI systems by addressing audience perceptions and expectations is crucial to creating engaging and meaningful robotic performances for young audiences.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Motivation: To explore how foundation models have revolutionized robotic applications, making systems smarter, dexterous, and capable of handling complex interactions.

Method: Conducts a survey of peer-reviewed research, community-driven projects, and industrial tools while proposing a taxonomy for classifying robotic model integration approaches.

Result: Presents a comparative analysis of agentic roles and integration techniques in robotics informed by current literature and industry trends.

Conclusion: Agentic architectures are critical for advancing robotic capabilities in reasoning, API interaction, and task management, shaping the next generation of autonomous systems.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GhostShell utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically control embodied systems by incrementally issuing function calls from streamed tokens, enabling real-time serial-parallel execution. It outperforms traditional approaches in terms of behavioral correctness and response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic systems often rely on fixed sequences or behavior trees for action execution, which limits their adaptability and efficiency. The paper seeks to leverage the dynamic capabilities of LLMs for better real-world interaction behavior.

Method: GhostShell introduces a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler to enable real-time and concurrent execution by embodied systems. These are tested through grounded experiments on a robotic prototype.

Result: GhostShell achieved a Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function calling APIs on 34 interaction tasks. It also demonstrated robustness in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for advancing real-time robotics control and interaction by integrating LLM-based token streaming mechanisms for improved adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

*Shunlei Li,Longsen Gao,Jin Wang,Chang Che,Xi Xiao,Jiuwen Cao,Yingbai Hu,Hamid Reza Karimi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GF-VLA, a framework enabling dual-arm robots to learn task-level reasoning from human demonstrations using vision-language-action fusion, achieving high success rates in dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to generalize robotic manipulation skills from low-level trajectory imitation, making it difficult to adapt to different objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations.

Method: The GF-VLA framework uses an information-theory-based approach to identify relevant human-object interactions, encodes these into scene graphs, and processes them with a language-conditioned transformer to generate behavior trees and motion commands. It also includes a cross-hand selection policy for dual-arm robots.

Result: GF-VLA achieves over 95% graph accuracy, 93% task segmentation, 94% grasp success, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success on dual-arm block assembly tasks, robustly generalizing across spatial and semantic variations.

Conclusion: GF-VLA successfully enables dual-arm robots to learn from human demonstrations and adapt to diverse task scenarios, marking a significant step in robotic manipulation generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

TL;DR: Affecta-context framework helps social robots adapt behaviors to physical contexts during human-robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve social robots' ability to adapt their behaviors based on physical contexts and user preferences.

Method: The framework clusters physical contexts and learns behavior prioritization via human-robot interactions, optimizing robot behaviors in alignment with physical attributes and user preferences.

Result: The framework was trained across 72 interactions in 2 physical contexts with 6 human participants, and successfully generalized behaviors to a new physical context.

Conclusion: The Affecta-context framework effectively enables robots to adapt and optimize their behaviors to diverse physical contexts and user preferences.

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

*Tong Hua,Jiale Han,Wei Ouyang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-view pose-only estimation model to reduce computational burden in GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry by tightly coupling visual measurements with camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The IEKF method in sensor fusion suffers from inefficiency and high computational burden due to joint optimization of camera poses and landmarks.

Method: A visual measurement model is derived to directly associate landmark representations with camera poses and observations, allowing for pose-only estimation and independence of null space from estimated poses.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy in both simulation tests and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The novel methodology enhances IEKF-based GVIO by simplifying computations and achieving superior performance in sensor fusion applications.

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of robots in high-intensity human-robot confrontations and assesses five affective expression modalities for conflict defusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how robots can effectively defuse conflicts during intense human-robot confrontations, especially when humans are hostile due to poor robot performance.

Method: Utilized a simulated conflict scenario involving a custom affective robot and 105 test participants to evaluate the effectiveness of five expression modalities.

Result: All tested modalities successfully conveyed acknowledgment and remorse in defusing conflict, with movement modality showing significant differences.

Conclusion: Effective conflict defusion relies more on a robot's social awareness and ability to react appropriately than on its specific expressive capabilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

### [310] [Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05396)
*Yufei Duan,Hang Yin,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce the inference time of diffusion policies in robotics by leveraging solutions from previous iterations, achieving faster inference without retraining or distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion policies in robotics are hampered by long inference times and consistent action maintenance requirements, making them less suited for latency-sensitive tasks or tasks with short cycles.

Method: The authors propose an approach based on the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme from optimal control. This involves using previous step solutions as initial guesses for iterative denoising and a scaling-based method for discrete actions, like grasping.

Result: The method significantly cuts inference time while maintaining performance comparable to full-step denoising in diffusion policies, as seen through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The new approach improves the efficiency of diffusion policies without necessitating resource-heavy retraining, enabling integration into pre-trained, computationally intensive models.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in existing autonomous driving models that focus excessively on ego-vehicle status, restricting planning robustess and decision-making effectiveness.

Method: DistillDrive leverages a structured teacher planning model for knowledge distillation, multi-objective learning targets, reinforcement learning for optimization, and generative modeling to construct planning-oriented interactions in latent space.

Result: The proposed model, validated on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets, demonstrates a 50% collision rate reduction and 3-point improvement in closed-loop performance compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: DistillDrive effectively enhances multi-mode motion feature learning and decision making in autonomous driving systems, contributing to improved robustness and operational safety.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for creating adaptable, bio-inspired robots using modular musculoskeletal systems, distributed actuation, and computational optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of mimicking natural organisms' adaptability and range of motion in robotic systems, which has remained a limitation in the field of robotics.

Method: The method involves the use of 3D-printed bones combined with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles, which contract via infrared radiation for local untethered control, and computational tools to optimize skeletal graphs and gaits for locomotion.

Result: The developed framework was validated by constructing robots capable of complex shape morphing, multiple control schemes, and environmental adaptability.

Conclusion: The system integrates material science, untethered control, and computational design to create musculoskeletal robots, moving closer to the functionality of living organisms.

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

*Alexander Fabisch,Wadhah Zai El Amri,Chandandeep Singh,Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores whether robotic hands need to mimic human hands fully, analyzing trade-offs in hand design for manipulation skills. It suggests that while human-like dexterity is desirable, simpler designs like three-finger configurations or innovative non-anthropomorphic designs could improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human manipulation skills require coordination of many degrees of freedom and complex sensor processing. The authors aim to evaluate if designing robotic hands to fully replicate human anatomy and capabilities provides a significant advantage for robotic applications.

Method: The study involves a comparison of human hand anatomy with commercially available robotic and prosthetic hands. It systematically reviews their mechanisms and manipulation skills, raising key questions about design trade-offs and the components most critical to achieving dexterity.

Result: They found that human-like five-fingered designs are not necessary for all tasks. Wrist flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are emphasized as critical. Three-finger designs strike a balance between simplicity and dexterity, and non-anthropomorphic or six-finger designs can outperform human hands in some scenarios.

Conclusion: While human hands represent a benchmark for dexterity, robotic hands optimized with simpler or innovative designs could achieve comparable or superior manipulation capabilities without replicating every human-like feature.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenges in human-robot collaboration, where the behavior, willingness, and task understanding of human partners can vary over time, requiring a flexible and adaptive communication system.

Method: MICoBot utilizes a Mixed-Initiative dialog approach and decision-making on three levels: meta-planning for high-level collaboration strategy, a planner for agent-specific task allocation based on capabilities, and action execution for low-level interactions.

Result: The system demonstrated improved task success and user experience, as shown in simulations and a 27-hour study with 18 unique human participants when compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: MICoBot succeeds in providing a more effective human-robot collaboration framework, integrating flexibility and dialog capabilities to adapt to diverse human partners.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

*Wenbo Li,Guanting Chen,Tao Zhao,Jiyao Wang,Tianxin Hu,Yuwen Liao,Weixiang Guo,Shenghai Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CleanUpBench introduces a benchmark for mobile cleaning robots with dual-mode capabilities, focusing on real-world applications rather than large-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filling the gap between complex academic benchmarks and the realistic commercial viability of cleaning robots, involving structured cleaning tasks.

Method: Using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, the benchmark evaluates agents with sweeping mechanisms and robotic arms in designed and procedurally generated environments, along with a detailed evaluation suite.

Result: Baseline agents using heuristic strategies and planning were provided, with assessments covering completion efficiency, motion quality, and control performance.

Conclusion: CleanUpBench serves as a scalable testbed that advances embodied intelligence evaluation in everyday cleaning scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

*Jianpeng Yao,Xiaopan Zhang,Yu Xia,Zejin Wang,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper enhances mobile robot navigation in crowds by combining prediction uncertainty estimates with reinforcement learning, significantly improving in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots navigating crowds face challenges in performance reduction when encountering scenarios that deviate from their training distribution. Addressing these uncertainties is crucial for enabling safe and robust navigation.

Method: The proposed method uses adaptive conformal inference to generate prediction uncertainty estimates, which are incorporated into reinforcement learning. These estimates guide the robot's actions through constrained reinforcement learning.

Result: In in-distribution settings, the approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, outperforming previous baselines by over 8.80%, with significantly fewer collisions and intrusions. It also shows high robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios, such as velocity changes, policy shifts, and group dynamics.

Conclusion: Augmenting observations with uncertainty estimates improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution navigation, enabling robots to make safer and more robust decisions in real-world crowd scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

TL;DR: Genie Envisioner (GE) is a unified platform combining video generation with robotics, featuring models for policy inference, simulation, and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a scalable and unified foundation for robotic manipulation by integrating policy learning, simulation, and evaluation using a video-generative approach.

Method: GE utilizes a video diffusion model (GE-Base) for structured latent representation, a flow-matching decoder (GE-Act) for action trajectory generation, and a neural simulator (GE-Sim) for policy validation.

Result: The GE platform enables precise and generalizable policy inference, scalable simulation, and standardized benchmarking through EWMBench.

Conclusion: Genie Envisioner sets a new standard for instruction-driven embodied intelligence, promising robust and scalable robotics frameworks while providing publicly accessible tools and benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for
robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and
simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is
a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the

a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent
representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,
flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference
across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable
evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural
simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.
The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite
measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action
alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable
and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied
intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.

### [319] [Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820)
*Mayra Sofia Ruiz Rodriguez,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates GPT-4o mini's capability to generate file-level log statements for ML projects, finding that while it aligns with human log placement 63.91% of the time, it suffers from overlogging (82.66%) and other limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess large language models' potential for generating file-level logs, which is underexplored but crucial for enhancing the reliability of ML applications.

Method: A dataset of 171 ML repositories with 4,073 Python files was used. Original log statements were removed, GPT-4o mini was prompted to generate logs, and an evaluation was conducted on placement, log quality, and log characteristics against human-written logs. A manual analysis of representative samples was also performed.

Result: GPT-4o mini introduced logs in the same positions as humans in 63.91% of cases but exhibited a high overlogging rate of 82.66% and faced challenges with aligning to project-specific logging conventions and logging within complex code blocks.

Conclusion: While the LLM demonstrates potential for generating file-level logs, issues like overlogging, poor adaptability to conventions, and difficulty with large code blocks need to be addressed for practical use.

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

### [320] [Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895)
*Wentao Lu,Alexander Senchenko,Abram Hindle,Cor-Paul Bezemer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated pipeline that extracts the most relevant frame from gameplay videos in bug reports, using FFmpeg and a vision-language model, to reduce manual review effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and unscalable process of manually reviewing gameplay videos for bug verification and triage in game development.

Method: The pipeline uses FFmpeg for keyframe extraction and GPT-4o vision-language model to rank and select the frame that best matches the textual bug description from submitted bug reports.

Result: The approach achieves an F1 score of 0.79 and an Accuracy of 0.89 for top-1 retrieved frames and performs best in Lighting & Shadow (F1 = 0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories.

Conclusion: Replacing video viewing with selected keyframes significantly speeds up game bug triaging, benefiting QA teams and developers by reducing manual work and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace,
generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To
verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted
videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In
this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a
single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers
instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.
  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video
to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug
moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a
vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match
the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We
evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos
and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The
pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the
top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 =
0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and
lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51).
  By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our
approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression
checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and
developers across the game industry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential risks and uncertainty Generative AI introduces to OSS communities and explore strategies for fostering community resilience.

Method: A conceptual exploration using McLuhan's Tetrad socio-technical framework to analyze Generative AI's impact across software practices, documentation, community engagement, and governance.

Result: Identifies both risks and opportunities in how OSS communities can adapt to disruptions caused by Generative AI in multiple domains.

Conclusion: OSS leaders and researchers should proactively shape their ecosystems to manage Generative AI-driven changes, rather than react passively to its challenges.

Abstract: Open Source Software communities face a wave of uncertainty as Generative AI
rapidly transforms how software is created, maintained, and governed. Without
clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and
ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that
underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a
socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks
and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS
development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community
engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers
can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply
reacting to technological upheaval.

### [322] [Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925)
*Sigma Jahan,Saurabh Singh Rajput,Tushar Sharma,Mohammad Masudur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies real-world faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs) and proposes a novel taxonomy and diagnostic heuristics for addressing them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning fault taxonomies miss unique issues in attention mechanisms, leading to critical failures and lack of diagnostic guidelines.

Method: A systematic analysis of 555 faults from 96 projects using data from platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face, leading to the creation of a seven-category fault taxonomy for ABNNs.

Result: Over 50% of ABNN faults are specific to attention mechanisms, and the study identifies four diagnostic heuristics explaining 33.0% of these faults.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the first comprehensive taxonomy and diagnostic strategies tailored to attention-based networks, addressing an important gap.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

TL;DR: The paper explores the underexplored intersection of large language models (LLMs) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), analyzing how LLMs can enhance OOP learning, coding, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLMs can improve learning, coding, and evaluation in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Method: The authors examine key stakeholders’ perspectives (programmers, learners, experienced programmers), identify critical stages in coding workflows, and propose methods for LLM integration.

Result: The paper identifies areas within coding workflows where LLMs can provide significant assistance, improving logical reasoning, code writing, and the overall programming experience.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into OOP processes has the potential to enhance coding workflows and logical reasoning, benefiting programmers across different experience levels.

Abstract: We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence
research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have
diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine,
and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust
body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks
through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP
remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited
understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and
code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work
aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key
stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced
programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows
where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we
propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately
enhancing the programming experience.

### [324] [An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034)
*Arabat,Ali,Sayagh,Mohammed,Hassine,Jameleddine*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Dependency management in software systems is essential for effective CI/CD pipelines and feature deployments. A study on OpenStack revealed significant challenges, including delayed identification during code review. The proposed ML models offer promising accuracy in predicting and identifying dependencies, enabling proactive management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in managing dependencies among software changes, which are critical for CI/CD pipeline success and effective feature deployments, particularly in complex systems like OpenStack.

Method: The authors conducted a study on OpenStack to understand dependency patterns and created a semi-automated approach using two machine learning models. One predicts the likelihood of dependencies, while the other identifies dependent change pairs.

Result: The study showed that dependencies are often identified too late, requiring significant effort from developers. The proposed ML models achieved strong predictive accuracy with AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014.

Conclusion: Proactively identifying dependencies can significantly mitigate delays and challenges in development processes. The proposed ML models are effective, though there's room for improvement in precision for dependent change identification.

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

TL;DR: LadyBug is a GitHub bot for Android apps that enhances bug localization by combining UI interaction data with text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve bug localization for Android apps by leveraging both textual and UI interaction data, addressing limitations of traditional text-retrieval methods.

Method: LadyBug integrates with a GitHub repository to analyze bug reports and reproduction traces, combining text retrieval with UI interaction data to provide ranked file lists likely containing bugs.

Result: Empirical evaluation using the RedWing benchmark with 80 bug reports demonstrated LadyBug's improved accuracy compared to text-retrieval-based methods.

Conclusion: LadyBug effectively enhances bug localization, significantly improving accuracy via UI data utilization, and is openly available for developers to use.

Abstract: This paper introduces LadyBug, a GitHub bot that automatically localizes bugs
for Android apps by combining UI interaction information with text retrieval.
LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a
bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record
a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace
to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both
the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the
reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the
project that most likely contain the reported bug.
  We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and
benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug
reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms
text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads
to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source
tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

### [326] [Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170)
*Lishui Fan,Yu Zhang,Mouxiang Chen,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve intermediate reasoning evaluation in reinforcement learning for code generation, using novel benchmarks and methods to counter reward hacking and enhance overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for code generation largely ignore the quality of intermediate reasoning processes, relying only on outcome-based rewards, which leads to suboptimal learning.

Method: The proposed approach introduces an LCB-RB benchmark with superior/inferior reasoning pairs, an OD-based method to train reward models on reasoning quality, and a P-GRPO RL technique that applies process-based rewards conditioned on task success.

Result: The resulting reward model achieves SOTA performance on LCB-RB and generalizes to other benchmarks. A 7B model trained with P-GRPO outperforms outcome-only baselines by 4.5% and matches GPT-4-Turbo's performance in code and mathematical tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning and reduces reward hacking in RL-based code generation, offering a robust and generalizable approach that is benchmarked quantitatively and made publicly available.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) and deterministic techniques to facilitate JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping using natural language. This is implemented in the MetaConfigurator tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many domains lack standardized models for research data, and creating these models remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-experts.

Method: The authors employ large language models (LLMs) for generating and editing JSON Schemas and schema mappings, along with deterministic rules to ensure scalability and reliability. These techniques are implemented in the MetaConfigurator tool, which supports natural language inputs and integration of heterogeneous data formats.

Result: The proposed approach enables non-experts to create and manage structured data models and schema mapping using natural language. The application example in chemistry showcases the applicability and accessibility of this method.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs and deterministic safeguards effectively lowers barriers to structured data modeling and integration for non-experts, making the process more accessible and reliable.

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data
engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are
typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of
datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating
them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a
hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping
based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated
into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model
editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data
integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and
YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through
deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our
work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By
combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work
significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data
integration for non-experts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate large language models' code reasoning abilities, often focusing on low-complexity scenarios with saturated scoring.

Method: SX-Bench evaluates models via tasks requiring complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning, using the concept of 'computation steps' to assess dynamic execution.

Result: Evaluation of 20+ models, including state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3, highlights SX-Bench's discriminative power, showing significant performance gaps on complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SX-Bench pushes code evaluation forward by spotlighting advanced reasoning challenges, revealing current models' limitations and paving the way for enhanced code intelligence assessments.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding
and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as
HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning
benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity
scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,
limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present
STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex
multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench
features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,
chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and
data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution
unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning
tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution
beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including
14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly
discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent
accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on
previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained
reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,
symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation
and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function
verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for
the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.

*Igor Costa,Christopher Baran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoGraph is a framework enabling software self-evolution for code, documentation, and pipelines using typed graphs and specialized small language models (SLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of evolving legacy software systems in a maintainable and automated way, with a focus on overcoming failure modes and limitations in modernizing aged codebases.

Method: EvoGraph utilizes typed directed graphs, adaptive mutation operators powered by specialized SLMs, and a multi-objective fitness mechanism to select viable changes.

Result: EvoGraph demonstrated improvements: 83% security vulnerability fixes, 93% functional equivalence in COBOL-to-Java translation, reduced latency by 40%, and cut feature lead time sevenfold compared to baselines. Extended experiments achieved 82-96% semantic equivalence across various languages and reduced computational costs by 90%.

Conclusion: EvoGraph provides a feasible approach for automated legacy software evolution, balancing adaptability with control, and moving toward Software 3.0 capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between IoT capabilities and their holistic sustainability applications in improving Business Processes, addressing environmental and other dimensions of sustainability.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual model linking IoT and BPM for sustainability, and a methodology for analyzing and implementing IoT-enhanced, sustainability-driven BPs.

Result: The approach is validated through an illustrative example in tourism and a case study in healthcare, demonstrating how IoT contributes to sustainable process improvement.

Conclusion: Integrating IoT into BPM provides a systematic way to measure and address sustainability holistically, emphasizing its value across domains like healthcare and tourism.

Abstract: The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the
Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business
Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving
sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),
sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.
However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach
to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work
proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of
analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of
BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,
linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to
sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,
identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced
BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism
domain and a case study in healthcare.

### [331] [Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Documentation to Code Traceability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16440)
*Ebube Alor,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating traceability between software documentation and source code, achieving substantial improvement over traditional methods, yet requiring human assistance for some challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of LLMs in automating traceability between documentation and source code, addressing a critical need in software development.

Method: The authors created two datasets from open-source projects and assessed LLMs' performance in trace link identification, relationship explanation, and multi-step chain reconstruction, benchmarking against traditional models like TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT.

Result: LLMs achieved F1-scores of up to 80.4%, outperforming baselines, with high partial accuracy for explanations and varying performance in multi-step chain tasks. Error patterns were identified and analyzed.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel in trace link identification and could serve as powerful tools, their limitations (e.g., naming-based errors and overgeneralizations) necessitate human-in-the-loop design and further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

### [332] [How Robust are LLM-Generated Library Imports? An Empirical Study using Stack Overflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10818)
*Jasmine Latendresse,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how six LLMs recommend Python libraries, revealing gaps in library usability despite favoring third-party libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how LLMs assist developers by recommending Python libraries, specifically focusing on functionality, usability, and resolution of dependencies.

Method: An empirical study where six LLMs were tasked with solving Python problems from Stack Overflow, followed by analysis of library recommendations and usability.

Result: LLMs favor third-party libraries that are mature and permissively licensed, but 4.6% of recommendations had structural mismatches, making dependency resolution difficult.

Conclusion: LLMs generate valid code but lack contextual support for dependency resolution, creating challenges for library usability and offering avenues for improvement.

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

*Mariia Sorokina*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces fractal frequency mapping to replicate complex neuronal effects, emphasizing sensitivity and noise amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing filters mainly suppress or amplify input spectral components, but fail to explain how neurons excite novel components.

Method: They propose a new fractal recomposition approach to transform input spectra and generate resonant frequency spikes.

Result: The transformation achieves high sensitivity detection, noise robustness, and signal amplification.

Conclusion: The findings suggest neuron functionality involves linear spectral summation over a nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form
enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters,
which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter
weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition
of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies
that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection,
robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model
illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation
of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how modular large language models (LLMs) can simulate language deficits such as aphasia by selectively deactivating components and retraining the remaining ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs, which align closely with human cognition, can simulate brain injury-induced language disorders (like aphasia) and explore their recovery mechanisms.

Method: The authors selectively disabled specific components in a modular Mixture-of-Experts language model to simulate different aphasia subtypes, validated the outputs against real patient data, and retrained the healthy components to evaluate recovery.

Result: Lesioning syntax or semantics experts in the model produced outputs resembling Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia respectively, and retraining healthy components restored significant linguistic functionality.

Conclusion: Modular LLMs are presented as a promising framework to model language disorders, providing insights into both the mechanisms underlying these disorders and potential computational approaches to therapy.

Abstract: The striking alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain
activity positions them as powerful models of healthy cognition. This parallel
raises a fundamental question: if LLMs can model the intact brain, can we
lesion them to simulate the linguistic deficits of the injured brain? In this
work, we introduce a methodology to model aphasia - a complex language disorder
caused by neural injury - by selectively disabling components in a modular
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. We simulate distinct aphasia subtypes,
validate their linguistic outputs against real patient speech, and then
investigate functional recovery by retraining the model's remaining healthy
experts. Our results demonstrate that lesioning functionally-specialized
experts for syntax or semantics induces distinct impairments that closely
resemble Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, respectively. Crucially, we show that
freezing the damaged experts and retraining the intact ones on conversational
data restores significant linguistic function, demonstrating a computational
analogue for rehabilitation. These findings establish modular LLMs as a
powerful and clinically-relevant potential framework for modeling the
mechanisms of language disorders and for computationally exploring novel
pathways for therapy.

*Paul Triebkorn,Huifang E. Wang,Marmaduke Woodman,Maxime Guye,Fabrice Bartolomei,Viktor Jirsa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study develops a virtual brain model to understand seizure mechanisms and explores methods for disruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how travelling excitation loops drive seizures and assess their susceptibility to targeted disruption.

Method: The researchers built a virtual brain model using diffusion MRI and neural fields, conducting parameter sweeps and testing interventions in silico.

Result: Re-entry mechanisms were identified as delay-constrained dynamics, with specific timing and lesion rules validated by recordings.

Conclusion: Delay-constrained re-entry is a key mechanism for brain synchrony, enabling personalized approaches to neuromodulation and minimally invasive interventions.

Abstract: Re-entry of travelling excitation loops is a long-suspected driver of human
seizures, yet how such loops arise in patient brain networks -- and how
susceptible they are to targeted disruption -- remains unclear. We reconstruct
a millimetre-scale virtual brain from diffusion MRI of a drug-resistant
epilepsy patient, embed excitable Epileptor neural fields, and show that
realistic cortico-cortical delays are sufficient to generate self-sustaining
re-entry. Systematic parameter sweeps reveal a narrow delay-coupling window
that predicts oscillation frequency and seizure duration across 184 recorded
seizures. Precisely timed biphasic stimuli or sub-millimetre virtual lesions
abort re-entry in silico, yielding phase-dependent termination rules validated
in intracranial recordings. Our framework exposes delay-constrained re-entry as
a generic dynamical mechanism for large-scale brain synchrony and provides a
patient-specific testbed for precision neuromodulation and minimally invasive
disconnection.

### [336] [Covariance spectrum in nonlinear recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05288)
*Xuanyu Shen,Yu Hu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper extends the understanding of neural population dynamics by analyzing covariance spectra in networks with nonlinear neurons across broad dynamical regimes, including chaos, using an effective recurrent connection strength parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previously, neural population activity was studied using covariance spectra in random recurrent networks with simplistic, linear models. The motivation is to address the gap in theory by investigating how these spectra behave in networks with nonlinear neurons and diverse dynamics.

Method: The approach involves deriving equations analogous to linear theory but modified with an effective recurrent connection strength parameter that incorporates neural connection weights and nonlinearity.

Result: The study finds that the effective connection strength effectively predicts covariance spectra and dimensions across various dynamical regimes, providing unified interpretations, even in chaotic systems without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The findings enhance theoretical support for applying covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits, improving the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in neural populations.

Abstract: Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven
significant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as
dimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically
and their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to
use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be
analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to
describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and
Sompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found
accurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic
insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al.
2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural
network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In
this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in
networks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including
chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by
equations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective
recurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection
weights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this
effective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the
spectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the
chaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of
nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support
for applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.

*Yuxuan Tao,Adel Javanmard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework integrating differential privacy with controlled variable selection, using Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation to preserve statistical properties while addressing privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in sensitive data environments under differential privacy constraints while addressing the limitations of existing noise-based privacy mechanisms.

Method: The framework uses Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation for data knockoffs to achieve both approximate isometry and $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. It employs a debiasing technique and analyzes factors affecting the privacy-power trade-off.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates preservation of False Discovery Rate control and statistical power in sensitive domains. Sufficient conditions are outlined under which power converges to one, outperforming noise-based differential privacy methods.

Conclusion: By bridging knockoff-based FDR control and private data release paradigms, the framework offers a robust approach for variable selection in high-dimensional, privacy-sensitive settings.

Abstract: We introduce a novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled
variable selection. Our framework enables rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control under differential privacy constraints. While the Model-X knockoff
procedure provides FDR guarantees by constructing provably exchangeable
``negative control" features, existing privacy mechanisms like Laplace or
Gaussian noise injection disrupt its core exchangeability conditions. Our key
innovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique
that simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate
isometry for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private
variable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension
reduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample
size and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our
analysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private
knockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the
power of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two
critical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --
enabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis
demonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections
outperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical
power even under strict privacy budgets.

Motivation: The motivation is to systematically address how discretization schedules for masked discrete diffusion models can be optimized using information geometry principles.

Method: The authors analyze discretization schedules for sampling in terms of the Fisher-Rao information geometry.

Result: They demonstrate that the optimal schedule derived from the Fisher-Rao geometry corresponds to the widely-practiced cosine schedule.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical backing for the effectiveness of the cosine schedule by linking it to optimality under Fisher-Rao geometry.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of choosing the discretisation schedule
for sampling from masked discrete diffusion models in terms of the information
geometry of the induced probability path. Specifically, we show that the
optimal schedule under the Fisher-Rao geometry recovers the popularly-used

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentially private quantile regression method for distributed high-dimensional data, addressing privacy and computational challenges while enabling statistical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address growing privacy concerns in handling heterogeneous datasets with sensitive information and enable secure statistical analysis using differential privacy.

Method: The authors propose a quantile regression approach incorporating a Newton-type transformation to convert the regression task into an ordinary least squares problem, alongside a differentially private estimation algorithm and a debiased estimator for inference.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate robustness and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, ensuring privacy and enabling valid statistical analysis through simulations.

Conclusion: A novel method for differentially private quantile regression is provided, balancing privacy, computational efficiency, and statistical accuracy, particularly in distributed settings with privacy concerns.

Abstract: With the development of big data and machine learning, privacy concerns have
become increasingly critical, especially when handling heterogeneous datasets
containing sensitive personal information. Differential privacy provides a
rigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling
meaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially
private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed
setting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the
relationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers
or heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to
the non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type
transformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary
least squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private
estimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal
statistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further
propose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid
confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we
propose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for
simultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,
suitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methods in practical scenarios.

Motivation: To address the gap in binary classification research by incorporating multivariate functional covariates, which is an area lacking comprehensive study.

Method: The authors propose an L1-regularized functional support vector machine with an associated algorithm to fit the classifier, leveraging the L1 penalty to identify relevant functional covariates.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in prediction accuracy and feature selection, as evidenced by simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The L1-regularized functional support vector machine expands the scope of functional data classification and effectively integrates prediction with feature selection capabilities.

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional
covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of
considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In
particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine
for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the
classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify
relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from
simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores bias and high-order error bounds in the Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert averaging under Markovian noise and introduces Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to address bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to refine the understanding of bias and error bounds in the commonly used LSA algorithm, particularly under challenging conditions of Markovian noise, and explore ways to mitigate persistent bias issues for improved algorithm performance.

Method: They propose a decomposition of bias via a linearization technique and apply the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to cancel the leading bias term. High-order moment bounds were derived for the extrapolated iterates.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that the leading bias term in the LSA algorithm is linear in the step size and cannot be eliminated by PR averaging. Application of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation successfully cancels this bias while preserving optimal covariance properties.

Conclusion: Richardson-Romberg extrapolation is an effective approach to enhance the accuracy of the LSA algorithm by addressing bias issues without compromising error performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear
Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging
under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant
step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a
linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the
leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR
averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive
high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error
term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla
averaged LSA iterates.

*Pradeep Kumar Shukla,Tanujit Chakraborty,Mustafa Sari,Joel Sarout,Partha Pratim Mandal*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This study explores using advanced time series forecasting methods for predicting the creep deformation of salt rock under various confining pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creep deformation prediction is vital for the safe and effective design of underground storage facilities for hazardous materials.

Method: The research employed deep neural networks (N-BEATS, TCN, RNN, and Transformers) and statistical models after testing data stationarity and analyzing causality and trends.

Result: N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed other models, offering up to 20% improved accuracy compared to traditional models in predicting creep deformation.

Conclusion: Advanced models like N-BEATS and TCN can effectively capture complex temporal deformation patterns, making them suitable for accurate creep predictions under varying stress levels.

Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods
to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt
rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment
is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for
nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for
their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high
ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined
using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain
datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure
levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including
Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed
minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data.
Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test,
confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and
wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of
deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time
Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against
statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results
demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various
stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a
15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models,
effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning models like encoder-decoders for understanding and predicting material responses in HEAs, aiding in the property-driven design of alloys.

Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology
across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense
industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure,
and property data presents significant challenges for predictive property
modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the
underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods
capable of learning from limited and heterogeneous datasets. This work presents
several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to
mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors
associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation
testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder
decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi
objective hyperparameter optimization, are evaluated for mapping alloy
composition to six mechanical properties. The models achieve competitive or
superior performance to conventional regressors across all properties,
particularly for yield strength and the UTS/YS ratio, demonstrating their
effectiveness in capturing complex composition property relationships.

*Alena Chan,Maria Garmonina*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This paper evaluates various optimization algorithms for forecasting S&P 500 Index returns, introducing a new optimizer called Roaree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance of existing optimization algorithms and address their limitations, specifically combining advantages of training speed and reducing loss oscillations.

Method: The MambaStock model is used to benchmark optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and Lion, followed by the introduction of Roaree to improve on Lion's characteristics.

Result: Gradient-smoothing optimizers achieved the lowest test errors, Lion offered the fastest training, and the proposed Roaree optimizer reduced oscillatory loss behavior while retaining speed.

Conclusion: The newly proposed Roaree optimizer is effective in combining the training speed of Lion and stability of gradient-smoothing optimizers, demonstrating potential for financial forecasting.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of several optimizers on the task of forecasting
S&P 500 Index returns with the MambaStock model. Among the most widely used
algorithms, gradient-smoothing and adaptive-rate optimizers (for example, Adam
and RMSProp) yield the lowest test errors. In contrast, the Lion optimizer
offers notably faster training. To combine these advantages, we introduce a
novel family of optimizers, Roaree, that dampens the oscillatory loss behavior
often seen with Lion while preserving its training speed.

*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Voost, a unified framework for virtual try-on and try-off tasks using a diffusion transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling garment-body correspondence effectively under varying poses and appearances in virtual try-on scenarios remains challenging.

Method: Voost employs a unified diffusion transformer model, enabling joint learning of try-on and try-off tasks without specialized networks, auxiliary losses, or labels. It uses attention temperature scaling and self-corrective sampling during inference for robustness and consistency.

Result: Voost delivers state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, excelling in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: By jointly modeling try-on and try-off tasks, Voost enhances garment-person relational reasoning while maintaining scalability and delivering superior results.

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive overview of the intersection between Gaussian Splatting and language models, and the potential improvements for text-conditioned 3D scene generation and understanding.

Method: The paper surveys existing approaches combining Large Language Models and Gaussian Splatting, examining theoretical details, practical implementations, and real-world applications.

Result: Key advancements include enabling text-guided 3D generation and editing, but limitations like computational inefficiencies and lack of annotated data are also identified.

Conclusion: The research highlights the transformative potential of combining language models with Gaussian Splatting, offering insights into challenges and suggesting paths forward to enhance semantic 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new density control method for improving 3D Gaussian Splatting-based novel view synthesis, leading to better scene reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in the densification strategy of 3D Gaussian Splatting by improving point primitive management to enhance view synthesis quality.

Method: The authors introduce a refinement process guided by the volumes of inertia associated with Gaussian functions. They also study initialization strategies using SfM and DIM methods.

Result: The proposed density control method demonstrates superior reconstruction quality over the standard 3DGS on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset.

Conclusion: This approach effectively improves novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting, showcasing enhanced reconstruction capabilities across various scenes.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for real-time, photorealistic view synthesis, addressing challenges in large-scale scene storage and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS representations have limitations in managing large-scale scenes and efficient storage, especially in complex environments or under constrained resources.

Method: The authors propose a perceive-sample-compress framework, featuring scene perception compensation algorithms, pyramid sampling representations, and a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm.

Result: Experiments reveal improved memory efficiency, enhanced visual quality, and maintenance of real-time rendering speed.

Conclusion: The framework optimizes resource usage, refines visual fidelity in key areas, and provides efficient storage solutions for 3DGS representations for large-scale environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

*Yifan Zhou,Beizhen Zhao,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes and proposes a novel framework with three key innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3DGS methods face spectral conflicts and issues like over-smoothing or feature collision, limiting their ability to capture motion details and deformation consistency.

Method: The framework uses hybrid explicit-implicit functions with innovations like spectral-aware Laplacian encoding, enhanced Gaussian dynamics attributes, and an adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based control.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes with improved fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic 3DGS framework successfully addresses spectral conflicts and achieves superior reconstruction results in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A framework called RAP synthesizes realistic talking head videos in real-time using audio input and a single reference image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce high-quality talking head animations but are computationally complex and unsuitable for real-time use, necessitating a simpler and faster alternative.

Method: RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm to ensure fine-grained audio control and avoid explicit motion supervision.

Result: RAP achieves precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains high visual fidelity under real-time constraints.

Conclusion: RAP establishes state-of-the-art performance in audio-driven portrait animation while meeting real-time processing requirements.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

### [351] [Point cloud segmentation for 3D Clothed Human Layering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05531)
*Davide Garavaso,Federico Masi,Pietro Musoni,Umberto Castellani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel segmentation paradigm for 3D point clouds, focusing on layered representation of clothed human bodies to accurately model underlying body parts and occluded clothing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation methods focus primarily on scene interpretation and lack semantic modeling for clothed bodies, necessitating a strategy to handle overlapping layers in garments and body modeling.

Method: The paper proposes a new layering-based segmentation approach using neural networks, applied to a synthetic dataset designed to simulate realistic 3D scans with labeled layering data. Both coarse and fine garment identification strategies are explored.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the layered segmentation methodology, demonstrating improved accuracy in identifying garment domains.

Conclusion: Introducing layered segmentation strategies optimizes 3D clothed human modeling, enabling detailed reconstruction of both body parts and garment layers, with effective results in synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

*Chris Careaga,Yağız Aksoy*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-supervised technique for realistic image relighting, merging traditional and neural rendering to achieve both physical control and photorealism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide photorealistic image relighting capabilities while maintaining physical control over illumination setups, similar to 3D graphics tools, for real-world scenes.

Method: The authors infer a colored mesh representation of scenes using monocular geometry and intrinsic estimates. They render images with a path-tracing engine followed by a neural renderer for final photorealistic output, facilitated by differentiable rendering.

Result: An effective pipeline for in-the-wild image relighting using self-supervised training that combines physical accuracy with photorealistic interpretation of scenes.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between physical control and photorealistic relighting, enabling advanced illumination editing in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the elusive connection between chaotic dynamics and unstable fixed points in high-dimensional neural systems.

Method: The authors use dynamical mean-field theory combined with numerical simulations to study kinetic energy distribution and its critical behavior in random recurrent neural networks.

Result: The study reveals a continuous shift in average kinetic energy from zero to positive at a critical synaptic gain. It also identifies power-law behavior near this critical point and validates steady-state activity distribution through simulations.

Conclusion: This research offers insights into the kinetic energy landscape and its potential reflection of phase space structure for non-equilibrium dynamics in neural systems.

Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in
high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by
combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We
find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a
positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a
power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity
distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations
on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding
the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space
for the non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Computer science education is a dynamic field with many aspects that
influence the learner's path. While these aspects are usually studied in depth
separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that

however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g.,
in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for
an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with
18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and
exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI
usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of
this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey
questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research
directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and
insights into the in-IDE format. The dataset aims to support further research

Motivation: To address the risks of unsafe and inappropriate AI-generated content in classrooms, especially for pupils aged 5-16 years.

Method: Implemented four safety guardrails — (1) prompt engineering, (2) input threat detection, (3) Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA), and (4) human-in-the-loop review process.

Result: The guardrails underwent evaluation, revealing both challenges and opportunities for refining safety measures in generative AI tools.

Conclusion: Effective safety measures require on-going iteration, refinement, and cross-sector collaboration through open-source sharing of code, datasets, and insights.

Abstract: There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education
sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However,
this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the
AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper
explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within
the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI
tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to
support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are
appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated
with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1)
prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically
sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate
attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to
assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a
human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content
before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these
safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to
take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper
highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI
education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails,
as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source

Result: The study identifies the optimal combination of machine learning model and preprocessing scheme through extensive benchmarking and validates its efficacy using observations of WASP-39b from JWST.

Conclusion: Machine learning regression techniques can serve as computationally efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional Bayesian methods for analyzing exoplanet transmission spectra, especially when applied to high-demand observatories like JWST.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from
transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally
computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming
observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives
that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study
of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their
performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission
spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the
accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include
partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors
(KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking
(STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of
different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance.
We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of
planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and
preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of
WASP-39b.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PaperEval is a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated paper evaluation, including a domain-aware retrieval module and a latent reasoning mechanism. It outperforms prior methods in accuracy and real-world use cases, with successful deployment in a paper recommendation system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising volume of research papers makes it challenging to identify high-quality works, and existing LLM-based methods for automated evaluation suffer from limited domain knowledge and reasoning abilities.

Method: PaperEval incorporates a domain-aware paper retrieval module for contextual comparison and a latent reasoning mechanism for understanding motivations and methodologies. It uses a progressive ranking optimization strategy to refine predictions iteratively.

Result: Experiments show PaperEval excels in academic impact and paper quality evaluation. Its deployment in a real-world system achieved significant engagement on social media, validated by thousands of views and subscribers.

Conclusion: PaperEval successfully addresses limitations in LLM-based paper evaluation, establishing its reliability for both academic and practical usage in filtering high-quality research.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that

### [359] [Align-for-Fusion: Harmonizing Triple Preferences via Dual-oriented Diffusion for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05074)
*Yongfu Zha,Xinxin Dong,Haokai Ma,Yonghui Yang,Xiaodong Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HorizonRec, a model for cross-domain sequential recommendation, leveraging diffusion models to harmonize user preferences across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like data sparsity and interest drift in personalized sequential recommendation by using multi-domain user behavior.

Method: Propose an align-for-fusion framework using dual-oriented diffusion models (DMs) to harmonize user preferences and reduce noise in user representations.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show HorizonRec's effectiveness in integrating fine-grained preferences across domains.

Conclusion: HorizonRec improves cross-domain preference fusion by adopting advanced diffusion techniques and addressing instability and noise concerns.

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

### [360] [Tool Graph Retriever: Exploring Dependency Graph-based Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05152)
*Linfeng Gao,Yaoxiang Wang,Minlong Peng,Jialong Tang,Yuzhe Shang,Mingming Sun,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), a method that uses tool dependency graphs to improve retrieval methods for AI agents. TGR achieves state-of-the-art performance and highlights the importance of considering tool dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current tool retrieval systems that lack the ability to consider dependencies between tools, leading to improper tool selection for task execution.

Method: The authors propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which builds a tool dependency graph based on a newly created dataset (TDI300K). Graph convolution is applied to represent tool dependencies, and these updated representations are used for retrieval.

Result: TGR improves the performance of existing dominant retrieval methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on commonly used datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of tool dependencies through TGR proves beneficial, showing that accounting for dependencies enhances the effectiveness of tool retrieval methods in AI systems.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

*Chiara Mallamaci,Aleksandr Vladimirovich Petrov,Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino,Vito Walter Anelli,Tommaso Di Noia,Craig Macdonald*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS) in music recommendation by introducing a sub-ID-level PPS method integrated into the RecJPQ framework, achieving higher novelty without reducing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music recommendation systems face challenges from repetitive listening behaviors which limit the discovery of new content, affecting user satisfaction.

Method: The authors repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a sub-ID level, enabling a trade-off between accuracy and novelty.

Result: The proposed sub-ID-level PPS (sPPS) demonstrated significant improvements in personalised novelty while maintaining recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: The integration of sub-ID-level PPS enhances the ability to deliver recommendations that balance repetition and novelty, making it a promising approach for music recommendation systems.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

### [362] [Scaling Generative Recommendations with Context Parallelism on Hierarchical Sequential Transducers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04711)
*Yue Dong,Han Li,Shen Li,Nikhil Patel,Xing Liu,Xiaodong Wang,Chuanhao Zhuge*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to support longer user history sequences in recommendation systems by combining context parallelism (CP) with jagged tensor support in HSTU attention models, enhancing model scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the ability of recommendation systems to model high cardinality and non-stationary features effectively, especially when processing longer user interaction histories with limited memory resources.

Method: The authors propose integrating context parallelism (CP) with support for jagged tensors in HSTU attention. This method addresses the challenges of scaling sequence lengths in recommendation systems while reducing memory usage and enabling efficient computation across GPUs.

Result: The approach achieves a 5.3x increase in the supported sequence length of user interactions and a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively overcomes memory and scalability constraints present in traditional recommendation models, enabling more significant metric improvements and better handling of longer user histories.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Leakage Impact Score (LIS) to assess alignment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recommendation systems, addressing challenges in evaluation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome significant challenges in evaluating the alignment of MLLMs in recommendation systems, particularly due to dynamic real-world scenarios, costly evaluations, and limitations of conventional metrics.

Method: The authors propose a novel metric, the Leakage Impact Score (LIS), to measure the upper bound of preference data instead of directly assessing MLLMs. They also share deployment strategies for MLLMs with LIS in practical environments.

Result: Online A/B tests in Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed demonstrated significant enhancements in user engagement (spent time) and advertiser value, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed metric, LIS.

Conclusion: The proposed Leakage Impact Score (LIS) serves as a practical and effective way to evaluate and enhance multimodal recommendation systems, addressing key evaluation challenges and delivering measurable impact in real-world settings.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^3$BSR, a model addressing multimodal and multibehavior sequential recommendation challenges by leveraging denoising techniques and expert interest modeling to improve recommendation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sequential recommendation accuracy by effectively integrating diverse multimodal information and user behavior patterns while addressing noise in data.

Method: The authors propose M$^3$BSR, which includes (1) a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer for removing noise in multimodal representations, (2) Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising for tackling implicit noise in user behavior, and (3) a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer to model and extract specific and common interests across behaviors and modalities.

Result: M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in multimodal multi-behavior sequential recommendation tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M$^3$BSR effectively addresses challenges in multimodal and multibehavior sequential recommendation by denoising noise in modalities and behaviors and extracting nuanced user interests, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

### [365] [On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05398)
*Bruno L. Pereira,Alan Said,Rodrygo L. T. Santos*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines how offline evaluations in recommender systems are impacted by exposure and sampling biases, offering insights on selecting reliable sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of biases—specifically exposure and sampling bias—in offline evaluation of recommender systems, as these distortions can undermine the reliability of model comparisons.

Method: Researchers use a fully observed dataset as ground truth to simulate diverse exposure biases and evaluate common sampling strategies based on four metrics: model separability, fidelity with full evaluation, robustness to exposure bias, and predictive alignment with ground truth.

Result: The study identifies specific conditions under which sampling biases distort evaluation outcomes and benchmarks best practices for reliable offline assessments of recommender systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical recommendations for minimizing bias in offline evaluations, enhancing the reliability and robustness of benchmarking recommender models.

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

TL;DR: KuaiLive introduces a publicly available real-time dataset from Kuaishou to advance live streaming recommendation research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of publicly available datasets that reflect the dynamic nature of live streaming environments, which has hindered academic research progress.

Method: They collect interaction logs from 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over 21 days, offering timestamps, user interactions, and side information to accurately model live streaming dynamics.

Result: KuaiLive provides benchmarks by evaluating several recommendation methods on the dataset, showcasing its utility for diverse tasks such as prediction and multi-task learning.

Conclusion: KuaiLive offers significant advantages by supporting diverse live streaming research domains, paving the way for future advancements in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces an alternative definition of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence called the extended G-JSD, which generalizes to positive densities and provides theoretical insights and closed-form expressions for Gaussian distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in extending the applicability of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence to general positive measures, addressing limitations of normalization and broadening its utility in information sciences and machine learning.

Method: The paper defines the extended G-JSD, compares it to the standard G-JSD, analyzes the gap between them, and derives bounds and closed-form expressions, particularly for multivariate Gaussian distributions.

Result: Results include the explicit gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD, derivation of upper and lower bounds, and corresponding closed-form expressions for multivariate Gaussians.

Conclusion: The work highlights that both the G-JSD and extended G-JSD can be seen as regularizations of the standard Jensen--Shannon divergence, enhancing their theoretical and practical relevance.

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces CodonMoE, a lightweight adapter for genomic language models, converting DNA models into RNA analyzers with high efficiency and without extensive RNA-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current approaches to genomic language models (gLMs) are computationally inefficient, either requiring redundant infrastructure for separate models or massive resources for multi-modal architectures.

Method: CodonMoE is an adaptive mixture model that transforms DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers by providing expert capacity mapping at the codon level without extensive RNA-specific training.

Result: CodonMoE-enhanced DNA models significantly outperform unmodified ones and achieve state-of-the-art results in RNA prediction tasks using 80% fewer parameters than dedicated RNA models.

Conclusion: CodonMoE offers an efficient pathway to unify genomic language modeling across modalities, leveraging DNA data while reducing computational demands and preserving performance.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge:
either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA
and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose
significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant
infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal
architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality
pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive
Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms
DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific
pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal
approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from
codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four
RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models
augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts,
with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80%
fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic
complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a
principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more
abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving
modality-specific performance advantages.

Motivation: To bridge gaps in disease classification by exploring molecular mechanisms underlying disease relationships, beyond clinical presentations.

Method: An automated agentic AI system, GenoMAS, analyzes transcriptomic data to identify gene and pathway-level similarities. A pathway-based similarity framework integrates database enrichment analysis.

Result: The study identifies both known and novel disease links through a similarity network, reveals disease-modulating effects of conditions like obesity and hypertension, and suggests therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare conditions.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the utility of agentic AI in revealing transcriptomic ties between diseases, highlighting molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities, and provide accessible results for further exploration.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden
beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a
transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by
analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated
agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a
novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database
enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The
resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and
previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological
pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these
connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based
taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and
hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic
repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based
on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition,
this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale
transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across
complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph-regularized optimization framework (GRIT) to improve zero-shot cell type annotation accuracy generated by LangCell in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts manually annotating cell types in scRNA-seq data using PCA and k-NN graph is effective but labor-intensive and doesn't scale to large datasets. LangCell provides automated zero-shot annotation, but its accuracy across all cell types remains inconsistent.

Method: The authors refine LangCell’s zero-shot logits through a training-free, graph-regularized optimization framework, leveraging PCA-based k-NN graph structures to enforce local consistency on predictions.

Result: GRIT improves zero-shot annotation accuracy consistently across 14 human scRNA-seq datasets, with gains up to 10%. It demonstrates successful propagation of correct signals through graphs for better predictions.

Conclusion: GRIT serves as a model-agnostic, scalable, and effective plug-in for automated cell type annotation, enhancing robustness and accuracy while eliminating extensive manual effort.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the
structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While
effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large
datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward
automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural
language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While
LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain
suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell
types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by
LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local
consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines
the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied
upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human
scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000
single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy,
achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism
by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling
back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is
training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for
enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Embedding-based pipelines using pre-trained DNA language models achieve comparable accuracy to fine-tuning, with greater efficiency and lower carbon emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether fine-tuning is essential in genomic applications or if alternative methods such as embedding-based approaches can be efficient and competitive.

Method: The study explores embedding extraction from pre-trained DNA language models and evaluates their performance in downstream tasks using lightweight classifiers.

Result: The embedding-based approach often outperforms fine-tuning methods on datasets with varying distributions, achieving faster inference, lower carbon emissions, and competitive performance, e.g., in enhancer classification and promoter classification.

Conclusion: Embedding extraction is a viable and efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering strong generalizability, reduced inference time, and better carbon efficiency for deploying DNA language models.

Abstract: Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide
Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various
genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning,
which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution.
In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always
necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed
representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers
can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data
distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while
reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding
extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and
efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or
unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA
embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for
fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon
emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification,
DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89
with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2).
These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon
efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance. The code is

for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by
the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important
classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic
properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link
graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) used
by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the
corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary
connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain
quantum gates that the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of
actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to
the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive
and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a
low number of qubits.

*Sara Giordano,Kornikar Sen,Miguel A. Martin-Delgado*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for efficient quantum circuit synthesis to generate desired quantum states, achieving scalable and optimized results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently synthesizing quantum circuits to generate specified target states, crucial in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: Utilizes tabular Q-learning with state-space discretization and a hybrid reward mechanism combining static rewards with dynamic penalties to optimize circuit generation.

Result: The framework, tested on graph-state preparation tasks, discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts and adapts robustly to a universal gate set.

Conclusion: The RL-driven approach provides an efficient and adaptable method for quantum circuit optimization in high-dimensional quantum state spaces.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for time series forecasting with Differential Privacy, achieving improved prediction accuracy and privacy-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sensitivity and privacy in time series forecasting while minimizing the performance degradation caused by Differential Privacy mechanisms.

Method: The proposed Q-DPTS framework integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, adhering to $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantees.

Result: Q-DPTS outperforms both classical and quantum baselines in prediction error under the same privacy budget, as demonstrated using the ETT dataset.

Conclusion: Q-DPTS successfully combines quantum expressiveness and privacy mechanisms to enable accurate and secure time series forecasting, paving the way for further research in quantum-enhanced privacy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

Conclusion: This work advances Quantum Machine Learning applications in solving aeroelastic problems, despite optimization challenges in hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to
aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate
the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and
regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor
networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we
observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate
or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Motivation: The paper aims to overcome interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and complex optimization challenges in quantum sensor development.

Method: QCopilot combines commercial LLMs, few-shot prompt engineering, vector knowledge bases, and specialized agents for task-specific operations such as optimization, modeling analysis, and problem diagnosis.

Result: Using QCopilot in atom cooling experiments led to the generation of $10^{8}$ sub-$\mathrm{\mu}$K atoms autonomously within a few hours—a 100x speed improvement over manual methods.

Conclusion: QCopilot reduces barriers to large-scale quantum sensor deployment, provides dynamic modeling capabilities, and can extend to other quantum information systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active

problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic

multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale
quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information
systems.

TL;DR: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning models require careful design to balance expressivity and trainability, leveraging dynamical symmetry and specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning is promising due to its hardware efficiency, but achieving a balance between expressivity and trainability remains a challenge.

Method: The paper explores a necessary condition based on the initial state, measurement observable, and symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations.

Result: Numerical simulations validate the proposed condition's role in ensuring both expressivity and trainability of pulse-based QML models.

Conclusion: The research offers a framework for creating practical pulse-based QML models that optimize both expressivity and trainability through thoughtful design.

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for optimizing engine control in hybrid electric vehicles, integrating GRUs and Decision Transformers to enhance efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy management in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), optimizing fuel consumption and battery charge sustainability in heavy-duty applications.

Method: The method includes reformulating engine control as a sequential decision-making process and augmenting SAC with GRUs and Decision Transformers in actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and enhance planning capabilities.

Result: The SAC agent with a Decision Transformer-based actor and GRU-based critic achieved near-optimal fuel savings within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming on HFET cycles and demonstrated superior generalization on unseen drive cycles.

Conclusion: Integrating GRUs and Decision Transformers into SAC enhances energy management performance and adaptability in hybrid electric vehicles, offering robust solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks,
adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel
consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We
present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We
reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and
enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision
Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal
dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and
generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive
cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show
that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8%
of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test
(HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks,
and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen
drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment),
generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network
(FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in
real-world settings.

Motivation: To enhance graph clustering techniques by addressing inter-connections between vertex sets in large-scale graph datasets.

Method: Efficient online sparsification algorithms tailored to identify bipartite-like clusters in undirected and directed graphs.

Result: Experimental evidences demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining clustering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms optimize graph clustering processes, bridging computational efficiency with real-world applicability.

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive

While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set

the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters

TL;DR: The paper introduces BTPG-max, an advanced algorithm to optimize temporal plan graphs for navigating delays in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), showcasing theoretical optimality and enhanced practical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the common issue of agent delays in MAPF scenarios, which makes predefined schedules infeasible, aiming to improve the robustness of execution amidst such uncertainties.

Method: The authors devised the locally optimal BTPG-max algorithm, enhancing the number of bidirectional pairs in Temporal Plan Graphs compared to prior models like BTPG.

Result: BTPG-max constructs graphs with significantly more bidirectional edges, displays superior anytime performance, and enhances the system's ability to handle agent delays compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: BTPG-max is an effective tool for improving MAPF execution under delays, offering robust and efficient navigation solutions that theoretically and practically outperform prior methods.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for
multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each
agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is
infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To
address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan
Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a
time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG
(BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs"
and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays.
Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max,
that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in
designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a
BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in
practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges,
superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.

*Federico Scarì,Olger Siebinga,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate automated vehicle (AV) interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) across four dimensions: interaction effect, perception, effort, and ability, moving beyond technical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of AV controllers focus on performance metrics, neglecting human-centred interaction aspects crucial for mixed-traffic environments.

Method: The study proposes a structured framework based on human-robot interaction, applying it to a driving simulator case study to analyze AV-HD interactions using one metric per domain.

Result: The research found that metrics covering all four domains reveal vital differences in driver experience when interacting with AVs, demonstrating the utility of comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates designing AV controllers that not only function effectively but interact safely and acceptably with humans, supporting policymakers and developers.

Abstract: As automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly integrate into mixed-traffic
environments, evaluating their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HDVs)
becomes critical. In most research focused on developing new AV control
algorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed
solely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping
efficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of
interaction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework
that addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot
interaction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction
effect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction
ability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on
human drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply
it to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts
with human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring
HDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative
metric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how
participants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,
aggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.
The results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the
evaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver
experience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more
comprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,
developers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour
beyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not
only functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a
human perspective.

Motivation: To address user dissatisfaction with verbose and complex AI responses in search applications and improve engagement.

Method: A study comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems with feedback from approximately 10,000 participants.

Result: Users prefer concise and source-attributed responses over elaborate explanations, revealing an uncanny valley effect in overly sophisticated AI outputs.

Conclusion: AI communication should prioritize directness, source attribution, and transparency over artificial complexity for better user engagement and trust.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize
verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user
satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.)
participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we
demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed
responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI
development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley
effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking,
leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that
optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly
sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing
assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead
suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement
and system reliability.

Method: Developing the SEI framework by integrating infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology to study credibility mediation across institutional, computational, and temporal dimensions.

Result: SEI highlights the importance of coordination over classification and promotes anticipatory and adaptive epistemic models, rather than relying on traditional representationalist models.

Conclusion: The SEI framework offers a novel lens for AI governance, knowledge production, and ethical design of information systems, particularly in the post-coherence era of hybrid human-machine systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the

paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a

theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over
classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of

*Xueyuan Xu,Wenjia Dong,Fulin Wei,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in EEG-based emotion recognition by proposing a channel-wise feature selection method, CWEFS, yielding improved emotion recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A need to deal with redundant and irrelevant information in high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data, which obstructs precise and real-time emotion recognition.

Method: CWEFS operates by integrating EEG feature selection with a shared latent structure model, preserving local geometry and incorporating adaptive channel-weight learning for EEG channels.

Result: CWEFS outperformed nineteen feature selection methods on three popular datasets, achieving optimal performance across six evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: CWEFS is validated as an advanced approach for EEG feature selection, significantly enhancing emotion recognition in multi-dimensional EEG setups.

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional
multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial
redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the
extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the
real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective
approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature
selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on
emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various
channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection
models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,
a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume
conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a
shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space
across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this
consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive
channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of
different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The
effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,
compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG
feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance
across six evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel feature selection algorithm named ADSEL to address challenges in multi-dimensional emotion recognition from EEGs, focusing on handling incomplete labels and improving classifier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to overcome overfitting and computational complexity in EEG-based emotion recognition due to high feature dimensionality and limited samples, as well as challenges due to incomplete emotion label data.

Method: The proposed method, called ADSEL, employs adaptive dual self-expression learning and least squares regression to integrate sample-level and dimension-level learning for reconstructing incomplete multi-dimensional labels and optimizing feature selection.

Result: ADSEL enhances the accuracy of label recovery by enabling cross-sharing of information between sample and dimension levels, effectively identifying the optimal subset of EEG features for emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The research successfully addresses the limitations of existing EEG feature selection techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of ADSEL in improving model generalization and feature subset optimization for multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial
research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high
dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently
leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature
selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most
existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional
emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent
subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which
can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection
methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on
correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the
correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with
various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion
recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression
learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a
bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression
learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the
cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the
simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and
dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label
recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces FDC-Net, a framework that integrates EEG denoising and emotion recognition tasks for improved noise-robust emotion recognition. Tests on DEAP and DREAMER datasets show strong results in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current EEG-based emotion recognition methods, which suffer from error accumulation, lack of synergy between denoising and emotion recognition, and lack noise robustness.

Method: The proposed FDC-Net framework establishes a dynamic coupling between artifact removal and emotion recognition through bidirectional gradient propagation, joint optimization strategies, and a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive Transformer.

Result: FDC-Net achieves a maximum correlation coefficient of 96.30% on DEAP and 90.31% on DREAMER for artifact removal. For emotion recognition under artifact interference, it achieves accuracies of 82.3% (±7.1%) on DEAP and 88.1% (±0.8%) on DREAMER.

Conclusion: FDC-Net effectively addresses the practical challenges in EEG-based emotion recognition by improving noise robustness and performance in both denoising and emotion recognition tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value
in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical
applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various
physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and
emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which
not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential
synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion
recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly
denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address
these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion
recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,
termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification
Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic
collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition
through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization
strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive
Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based
emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels
were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition
performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the
denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of
96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the
emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net
achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on
DREAMER.

*Wei Xiang,Muchen Li,Jie Yan,Manling Zheng,Hanfei Zhu,Mengyun Jiang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to help drivers in Level 3 automated driving systems maintain attention and manage secondary tasks via humanized advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Level 3 automated systems reduce drivers' risk perception, necessitating a method to assist drivers during emergencies requiring takeover.

Method: The study uses LLMs to deliver persuasive advice based on road conditions, utilizing visual and auditory cues to influence drivers.

Result: The tool was found effective in keeping driver attention, lowering cognitive load, and better coordinating secondary tasks with takeover action.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in enhancing driver support during multi-tasking in automated driving scenarios.

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems allows drivers to engage in secondary tasks
while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency
necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a
limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To
address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions
through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions
encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver
behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that
our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive
load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides
insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task
automated driving.

### [390] [Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05012)
*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEAR, a system aiming to enhance prompt management in modern LLM workflows by making prompts structured, adaptive, and integrated within the execution model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and lack of integration of prompts within LLM pipelines, which limits optimization, reuse, and runtime control.

Method: Develop and implement SPEAR, a language and runtime system, featuring runtime prompt refinement and structured prompt management with prompt algebra for constructing and adapting prompts.

Result: Early experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of runtime refinement and structured management, alongside optimizations like operator fusion and prefix caching, achieving better results compared to static prompts.

Conclusion: SPEAR improves LLM workflows by enhancing prompt adaptability, efficiency, and reusability, paving the way for better control and automation in data-centric systems.

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenticData, a system enabling natural language queries for data analysis across structured and unstructured domains, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify unstructured data analytics, reducing the reliance on experts, and addressing inefficiencies in existing systems.

Method: AgenticData utilizes a feedback-driven planning technique to convert natural language queries into semantic plans and uses a multi-agent collaboration strategy involving three agents.

Result: AgenticData demonstrated superior accuracy on diverse tasks across three benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: AgenticData proves effective for simplifying and improving unstructured data analytics, making it accessible through natural language interfaces.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

*Zhaowei Wang,Yunsong Huang,Weicheng Liu,Hui-Ming Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed RF sensing system using Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas and deep reinforcement learning to enhance object detection accuracy, even in noisy and jammed environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RF sensing methods face challenges due to adverse propagation channels, including fading and noise, impacting sensing accuracy.

Method: The authors deploy distributed RIMSA receivers and use deep reinforcement learning for optimizing beamforming patterns, combined with neural networks for signal-to-sensing mapping.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate superior sensing performance for the proposed distributed RIMSA system, overcoming environmental challenges and maintaining accuracy under jamming attacks.

Conclusion: Using distributed RIMSA receivers with optimized beamforming patterns offers a robust, high-accuracy solution for RF sensing, even in interference-prone environments.

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

*Theia Henderson,David R. Karger,David D. Clark*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graffiti, a system for creating personalized social applications that interoperate, allowing users to retain connections and data while navigating various app designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigidity of existing one-size-fits-all social app designs and the technical challenges of building new, interoperable communities.

Method: The researchers propose the Graffiti system, utilizing total reification for compatibility in diverse designs and channels to avoid unintended interoperation. They implemented decentralized APIs and built a Vue.js plugin to showcase applications resembling popular platforms like Twitter and Wikipedia.

Result: Graffiti enables developers to create interoperable yet personalized social applications that prevent data silos and cater to diverse aesthetic and functional preferences.

Conclusion: The Graffiti framework demonstrates how to support innovation in social applications by fostering a flexible, interoperable ecosystem that balances personalization with connectivity.

Abstract: Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid
one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both
technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from
existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a
wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also
interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of
designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all
without losing their friends or data.
  Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly
contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate.
Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by
accident, avoiding context collapse.
  Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we
show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built
a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter,
Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore
how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader
ecosystem that Graffiti enables.

*MD Shaikh Rahman,Feiroz Humayara,Syed Maudud E Rabbi,Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving content-based mammographic image retrieval systems, achieving significant precision using advanced CNN architectures and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inherent complexity of mammographic image retrieval tasks requiring exact BIRADS categorical matching across five classes and overcome methodological limitations such as small sample sizes and improper validation.

Method: It systematically evaluates CNN architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies like sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble optimization using rigorous data splitting and statistical validation via bootstrap confidence intervals.

Result: Substantial improvements were achieved in precision@10, particularly with DenseNet121 and ResNet50 using advanced fine-tuning, and combining architectures via super-ensemble optimization reached new performance benchmarks of 36.33%.

Conclusion: The study establishes new benchmarks for 5-class medical retrieval tasks, proposes evidence-based guidelines for architecture selection, and highlights its clinical relevance for diagnostic support and quality assurance applications.

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

*Suyi Chen,Haibin Ling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Introduced cryoGS, a Gaussian mixture model-based method for efficient, self-contained cryo-EM 3D reconstruction using raw particle images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations with existing cryo-EM reconstruction methods that require external initialization, by creating a method capable of stable reconstruction without external dependencies.

Method: Developed cryoGS, which integrates Gaussian splatting with cryo-EM imaging physics and includes innovations like orthogonal projection-aware splatting with normalization and FFT-aligned coordinate systems.

Result: Experiments on real cryo-EM datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS compared to representative baseline methods.

Conclusion: cryoGS is a stable and efficient solution for 3D cryo-EM image reconstruction, eliminating the need for external initialization and enabling fully self-contained pipelines.

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

*Caner Özer,Patryk Rygiel,Bram de Wilde,İlkay Öksüz,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach using implicit neural representations (INRs) for artifact detection in medical imaging, aiming to reduce memory overhead and improve scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in medical imaging reduce diagnostic accuracy, and current image-based artifact detection methods are constrained by preprocessing needs and high memory requirements.

Method: They introduce INRs to create compact, continuous image representations and complement this with deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers for quality assessment.

Result: The proposed method was tested on the ACDC dataset with synthetic artifact patterns, showing effective image quality assessment comparable to alternatives but with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Using INRs with advanced neural architectures offers a scalable and efficient solution to artifact detection in medical imaging, balancing performance and computational demands.

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in registering pre-surgery MR images with post-resection US images, which have distinct imaging characteristics.

Method: The method employs unpaired style transfer using a 3D CycleGAN to generate synthetic T1 images and uses a coarse-to-fine registration process with affine and deformable transformations.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances MR to US image registration, showing promising results in aligning these distinct modalities.

Abstract: We developed a pipeline for registering pre-surgery Magnetic Resonance (MR)
images and post-resection Ultrasound (US) images. Our approach leverages
unpaired style transfer using 3D CycleGAN to generate synthetic T1 images,
thereby enhancing registration performance. Additionally, our registration
process employs both affine and local deformable transformations for a
coarse-to-fine registration. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
the consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

TL;DR: The study evaluates AI models' ability to differentiate Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas, predict genetic aberrations, and classify diagnostic categories, outperforming pathologists but with some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a diagnostic challenge in distinguishing Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas due to overlapping histological features, and improved methods are needed.

Method: AI models were trained and validated on a dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 melanomas, assessing their performance in three tasks: differentiation of tumor types, genetic aberration prediction, and diagnostic categorization. Comparison with pathologists and a simulation experiment on workflow impact were conducted.

Result: The top AI model achieved 0.95 AUROC and 0.86 accuracy in distinguishing tumor types. It surpassed random guessing in predicting genetic aberrations (accuracy of 0.55) and diagnostic categories (accuracy of 0.51). Although AI outperformed pathologists, differences were largely not statistically significant.

Conclusion: AI exhibited high predictive ability in differentiation tasks and some advantage in more complex predictions, potentially reducing costs and workflow times in pathology when integrated.

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

*Jillur Rahman Saurav,Mohammad Sadegh Nasr,Jacob M. Luber*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper explores using a multi-level VQGAN to generate virtual H&E stains from mIF images, outperforming standard cGAN in quality and utility for diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of molecular data from mIF imaging with morphological H&E standards is crucial for unlocking the potential of molecular diagnostics using H&E-based CAD tools.

Method: A multi-level Vector-Quantized GAN (VQGAN) was employed and compared with a standard conditional GAN (cGAN) for producing virtual H&E stains from mIF images, tested on colorectal cancer datasets.

Result: VQGAN-generated images outperform cGAN in visual plausibility, nuclei segmentation, and semantic tissue classification tasks, showing better agreement with ground-truth data.

Conclusion: Multi-level VQGAN offers a superior approach for generating accurate virtual stains, bridging molecular and morphological analyses, and improving integration into H&E-based workflows.

Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep,
spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the
morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) can be very important for
obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a
virtual H&E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate
morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the
vast ecosystem of H&E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze
rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological
analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level
Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity
virtual H&E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a
standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal
cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional
utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures
produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN
provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically,
downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue
classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior
performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the
cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior
architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a
viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and
powerful H&E-based analytical workflows.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ERDES dataset for improving automated detection and classification of retinal detachment (RD) using ultrasound clips. It also provides benchmarks based on spatiotemporal CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clinical challenges in diagnosing retinal detachment (RD) accurately, especially determining whether the macula is intact or detached, necessitates a robust, automated imaging solution to assist healthcare providers.

Method: The paper introduces ERDES, an open-access dataset containing labeled ocular ultrasound clips for RD presence and macular status. It also uses spatiotemporal convolutional neural networks to establish baseline benchmarks for automation.

Result: ERDES dataset was curated and labeled to support RD detection and macular classification. Benchmark evaluations using multiple CNN models were provided, demonstrating potential in automating RD assessment.

Conclusion: The ERDES dataset aims to enable the development of machine learning models capable of automating RD detection, ultimately improving diagnostic capabilities in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Retinal detachment (RD) is a vision-threatening condition that requires
timely intervention to preserve vision. Macular involvement -- whether the
macula is still intact (macula-intact) or detached (macula-detached) -- is the
key determinant of visual outcomes and treatment urgency. Point-of-care
ultrasound (POCUS) offers a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible
imaging modality widely used in diverse clinical settings to detect RD.
However, ultrasound image interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise
among healthcare providers, especially in resource-limited settings. Deep
learning offers the potential to automate ultrasound-based assessment of RD.
However, there are no ML ultrasound algorithms currently available for clinical
use to detect RD and no prior research has been done on assessing macular
status using ultrasound in RD cases -- an essential distinction for surgical
prioritization. Moreover, no public dataset currently supports macular-based RD
classification using ultrasound video clips. We introduce Eye Retinal
DEtachment ultraSound, ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular
ultrasound clips labeled for (i) presence of retinal detachment and (ii)
macula-intact versus macula-detached status. The dataset is intended to
facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for
detecting retinal detachment. We also provide baseline benchmarks using
multiple spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. All
clips, labels, and training code are publicly available at

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: PoET-2, a multimodal protein foundation model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in understanding complex mutations and outperforms previous methods in sequence-function tasks, particularly with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs have shown potential in protein understanding and design, but scaling them has not improved mutation comprehension or protein function prediction, highlighting a need for advanced architectures.

Method: PoET-2 integrates retrieval-augmented family-specific learning, structural conditioning, hierarchical transformer encoders, and a dual decoder with causal and masked objectives for generative and bidirectional modes.

Result: PoET-2 leads in zero-shot variant effect prediction and performs exceptionally on multi-mutation and indel mutation scoring. It surpasses prior methods, especially in supervised tasks with small datasets.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centered architectures provides significant advancements in protein foundation models for understanding and predicting protein functions.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural
protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein
sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works
have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does
not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for
protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal,
retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context
learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure
conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2
uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context
ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language
modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and
bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring
variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised
settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning
sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work
highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal,
family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.

*Iyiola E. Olatunji,Franziska Boenisch,Jing Xu,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerabilities of graph-aware large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks, identifies new attack surfaces, and proposes a defense framework called GALGUARD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the rising integration of LLMs with graph-structured data for improved task performance, prompting an investigation into their robustness, a largely unexplored area.

Method: The authors assess vulnerabilities using existing adversarial attack methods designed for graph-based models, apply these attacks to LLAGA and GRAPHPROMPTER models, and discover a novel attack surface in LLAGA. They propose GALGUARD, a defense mechanism combining LLM-based feature correction and GNN structural defenses.

Result: The findings reveal that LLAGA's node sequence template increases vulnerability, GRAPHPROMPTER's GNN encoder is comparatively robust, but both are susceptible to feature perturbation attacks.

Conclusion: Certain design choices in graph encoding influence the robustness of graph-aware LLMs. The defense framework GALGUARD effectively mitigates both feature perturbations and structural attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

### [403] [Incident Response Planning Using a Lightweight Large Language Model with Reduced Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05188)
*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil C. Lupu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel LLM-based method for incident response planning that aims to reduce hallucination while improving recovery times and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying effective response actions for complex systems during cyberattacks, leveraging embedded security knowledge in LLMs.

Method: Introduces a three-step process involving fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning to create response plans with bounded hallucination probabilities.

Result: Experimental analysis showed shorter recovery times by up to 22% and demonstrated the method's generalizability across diverse incident types and actions.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight method is effective for incident response, reduces hallucination risks, enhances recovery times, and is deployable on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

*Wanting He,Wenyuan Li,Yunran Wei*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for evaluating pension funds periodically and dynamically managing risks using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for improved evaluation methods for pension funds by considering interim periods and dynamic risk management.

Method: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is employed along with calibration of U.S. mortality rates using the Lee-Carter model to optimize investment and insurance strategies.

Result: Numerical findings reveal that periodic evaluations result in risk-averse strategies, while improved mortality projections lead to more risk-seeking behavior.

Conclusion: Periodic, dynamic evaluations of pension funds offer insights into managing risks better during interim periods and adapt strategies to mortality trends.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for the periodic evaluation of
defined-contribution pension funds. The performance of the pension fund is
evaluated not only at retirement, but also within the interim periods. In
contrast to the traditional literature, we set the dynamic risk measure as the
criterion and manage the tail risk of the pension fund dynamically. To
effectively interact with the stochastic environment, a model-free
reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to search for optimal investment
and insurance strategies. Using U.S. data, we calibrate pension members'
mortality rates and enhance mortality projections through a Lee-Carter model.
Our numerical results indicate that periodic evaluations lead to more
risk-averse strategies, while mortality improvements encourage more
risk-seeking behaviors.

*Richard Duong,Jannis Chemseddine,Peter K. Friz,Gabriele Steidl*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative modeling approach based on the telegrapher's equation, demonstrating advantages over existing diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative models have limitations, such as unbounded velocity norms and challenges in scalability.

Method: The authors propose a generative model grounded on the damped wave equation (telegrapher's equation) using a multi-dimensional stochastic Kac process. Neural networks approximate the velocity field for sample generation under the flow matching framework.

Result: The model exhibits global bounded velocity norms and Lipschitz continuous probability flow in Wasserstein distance, showing better scalability and performance compared to diffusion models in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The telegrapher's equation-based generative modeling approach overcomes drawbacks of diffusion models and provides a scalable alternative with analytically tractable velocity fields.

Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model
based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation.
Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac
type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process
in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability
flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to
diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the
Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these
considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of
independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this
process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space
and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point
analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network
that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its
advantages over diffusion models.

TL;DR: This paper implements a novel quantum regression approach to study gene-gene interactions in Alzheimer's, focusing on key genes to better understand disease progression for potential therapies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of decoding gene-gene interactions in Alzheimer's disease, a multifactorial illness, to enable advancements in targeted therapies and diagnostics.

Method: The authors develop a Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) based on Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to analyze interactions among key genes in the Entorhinal Cortex using genetic data from AD patients.

Result: The study identifies intricate interactions among key Alzheimer's-related genes, offering insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the disease's pathogenesis.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of Alz-QNet in uncovering gene regulatory mechanisms in Alzheimer's, paving the way for effective gene-based therapies and diagnostics.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease
(AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge.
Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the
gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this
article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how
some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol
regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1
($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by
other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in
gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network
(Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the
state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene
interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal
Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed
Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$,
$FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE
microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database
$GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the
progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions,
shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the
pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or
regulators for theranostics.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper investigates changes in Federal Reserve communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the focus on financial stability and unconventional monetary policy compared to earlier crises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the Federal Reserve adapts communication strategies amidst crises, particularly comparing its approach during COVID-19 with historical economic stresses like the dot-com and global financial crises.

Method: The authors used specialized dictionaries (focused on COVID-19, UMP, and financial stability), sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, alongside a comparative analysis of Fed communications across different crises.

Result: The paper finds that the Federal Reserve's communications were more reactive to COVID-19 than earlier crises, with notable use of declining sentiment in signaling monetary policy changes. It also documents a shift towards discussing unconventional monetary policy as a central communication theme since the Global Financial Crisis.

Conclusion: Central bank communication strategies evolve significantly during crises, showcasing an institutional shift in adaptation strategies, particularly in incorporating unconventional monetary policy into regular discourse.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of applying large language models (LLMs) for ASR in low-resource language settings, which is underexplored compared to their successes in high-resource contexts.

Method: The authors use the SLAM-ASR framework that integrates a lightweight projector between a speech encoder and an LLM. They evaluate training data requirements and the efficacy of pretrained monolingual and multilingual projectors.

Result: Findings show that monolingual or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource languages alleviate the challenges of data scarcity in low-resource ASR settings. Performance was tested using multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: Pretrained multilingual projectors and LLMs effectively enhance performance on low-resource ASR tasks, offering guidance for further research in multilingual and low-resource language applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a
trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly,
we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges posed by dysarthric speech in creating assistive technologies, especially due to limited data and potential biases in speech synthesis systems.

Method: The researchers evaluated the F5-TTS neural speech synthesis system using the TORGO dataset, analyzing intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation alongside fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference.

Result: F5-TTS showed strong bias towards prioritizing intelligibility over speaker similarity and prosody preservation for dysarthric speech.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to incorporate fairness-aware mechanisms in dysarthric speech synthesis to build more inclusive assistive technologies.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive
technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent
advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning,
facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may
introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using
TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody
preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like
Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric
severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech
intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech
synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware
dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech
technologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a small-footprint open-vocabulary KWS model with state-of-the-art performance, leveraging a novel keyword encoder and cross-attention detection mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and accurate system for detecting open-vocabulary keywords in speech, especially suited for small devices, and to address limitations in handling out-of-domain conditions and second-language speech.

Method: The model consists of a speech encoder (tiny Whisper or tiny Conformer), a target keyword encoder as a hyper-network generating convolutional filter weights, and a detection network integrating a Perceiver module's cross-attention mechanism for precise keyword detection.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art keyword spotting performance, generalizes well to out-of-domain and second-language conditions, and offers high efficiency with only 4.2 million parameters in its smallest model.

Conclusion: The proposed model is both highly efficient and robust, outperforming larger models while maintaining generalization and effective handling of diverse speech conditions.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of detecting words
or terms within speech recordings, regardless of whether they were included in
the training data. This paper introduces an open-vocabulary keyword spotting
model with state-of-the-art detection accuracy for small-footprint devices. The
model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a
detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny
Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that
takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of
weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a
keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter
weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the
cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the
target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system
achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our
smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models
that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to create a domain-specific, low-latency AI voice agent pipeline to improve automation and interactivity in the telecommunications industry, particularly for call center and customer support services.

Method: The approach integrates four tailored AI models—TSLAM (a quantized telecom language model), T-VEC (telecom embedding model), TTE (telecom ASR), and T-Synth (telecom TTS)—operating in tandem for real-time interactions. The pipeline employs streaming ASR, conversational intelligence, retrieval-augmented generation, and TTS.

Result: The evaluation on 500 telecom-specific queries showed real-time processing capabilities (RTF < 1.0) across the pipeline, indicating suitability for low-latency telecom deployments.

Conclusion: The pipeline and its integrated models are effective for enabling next-generation automated telecom applications, achieving low-latency, domain-optimized voice AI interactions for use cases like customer support and diagnostics.

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time,
interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center
automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven
customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized
models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language
Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific
Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive,
domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken
interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE),
conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over
telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for
telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500
human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent
queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and
real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise,
low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examining methods for emotion analysis via brain-computer interfaces, with focus on addressing barriers like constrained music datasets, unimodal data reliance, and cumbersome systems.

Method: AI-generated music for emotion induction coupled with wireless, portable headband devices that collect synchronized EEG-fNIRS recordings.

Result: Validation with a 14-hour dataset (20 participants) revealed effective emotion elicitation (valence/arousal). Current dataset expands to 44 participants, made publicly accessible.

Conclusion: MEEtBrain enhances emotion-based neurophysiological research with scalable stimuli, multimodal data fusion, and real-world applicability via portable systems, encouraging wider adoption and future research.

Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based
affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer
Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for
emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus
Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and
curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings
that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}:
Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights
from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome
setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability
due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these
limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for
emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with
synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the
music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale,
eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use
our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style
and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A
14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to
validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target
emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset
(44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to
promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is

*Huaicheng Zhang,Wei Tan,Guangzheng Li,Yixuan Zhang,Hangting Chen,Shun Lei,Chenyu Yang,Zhiyong Wu,Shuai Wang,Qijun Huang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL framework to control hallucination in AI-driven song generation, showing significant improvement in alignment with lyrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative language models for song creation suffer from hallucination, misaligning produced songs with input lyrics.

Method: The authors use a reinforcement learning framework with three optimization strategies (DPO, PPO, GRPO) and a hallucination preference dataset based on phoneme error rates.

Result: The framework achieved significant reductions in hallucination using PER metrics: DPO (7.4%), PPO (4.9%), GRPO (4.7%) while maintaining musical quality.

Conclusion: This RL framework systematically addresses hallucination control, enhancing lyric alignment and musical coherence, with potential for broader generative music capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated
AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer
from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics
and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained
self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core
challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging
preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions
include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed
via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture
alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three
distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance
positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and
GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to
iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,
yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective
and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress
hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents
a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song
generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music
style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future
generative song research.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs) to calculate information content (IC) and evaluates their effectiveness in modeling musical expectancy and surprisal, achieving better or comparable performance to Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer's (GIVT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the modeling of musical expectancy and surprisal, which is key for understanding musical structure and patterns.

Method: The authors used IC calculations from autoregressive diffusion models based on diffusion ordinary differential equations and compared them against GIVTs. They evaluated the models on tasks such as monophonic pitch surprisal and segment boundary detection in multi-track audio.

Result: ADM-based models demonstrated better performance in terms of negative log-likelihood and matched or exceeded GIVTs in both musical surprisal tasks.

Conclusion: Surprisal estimated at different noise levels in the diffusion process aligns with audio features at varying granularities. Tunable noise levels enhance task performance, showcasing the ADM's adaptability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative
Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical
expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such
modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We
empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms
of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's
effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1)
capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in
multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the
performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different
diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio
features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we
find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks'
results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'JPS,' a new method combining visual perturbations and textual prompts for bypassing safety filters in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), achieving high attack success and malicious intent fulfillment rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of jailbreak attacks by ensuring that bypassed safety filters produce outputs that fulfill the attacker’s malicious intent, addressing issues of low-quality harmful content in previous methods.

Method: JPS employs a collaborative process combining adversarial image perturbations and optimized textual prompts to bypass safety measures. These components are iteratively co-optimized for better attack performance. It also introduces the Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) to evaluate the alignment of outputs with malicious intent.

Result: The proposed JPS method achieves state-of-the-art results in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) across various MLLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: JPS demonstrates efficacy in bypassing safety mechanisms while ensuring outputs align with malicious intentions, advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak attacks on MLLMs.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

### [418] [Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05473)
*Sam Kouteili,Hiren Madhu,George Typaldos,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper explores leveraging code embeddings to predict audio embeddings for live-coding, allowing alignment between code and its musical output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM code generation for creative coding, particularly in live-coding music, where diverse and meaningful relationships between code and its audio output are crucial.

Method: The authors investigate the topology between code and audio embeddings, finding non-linear relationships. They build a predictive model to construct an alignment map between the two spaces.

Result: The model successfully predicts audio embeddings from code embeddings, aligning the two spaces and enabling diverse, relevant musical output.

Conclusion: A code-audio embedding alignment map can be learned to improve LLM-driven creative coding for musically diverse and user-intent-aligned outputs.

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize
their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present
unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's
audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and
produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and
audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a
simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive
model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the
aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts
output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

### [419] [Can SGD Handle Heavy-Tailed Noise?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04860)
*Ilyas Fatkhullin,Florian Hübler,Guanghui Lan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the theoretical behavior of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under heavy-tailed noise, demonstrating that vanilla SGD achieves optimal sample complexity across various optimization regimes despite challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether vanilla SGD, without any adaptive modifications, can effectively handle heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors analyze the convergence guarantees of vanilla (projected) SGD under the assumption that stochastic gradients have bounded p-th moments for p in the range (1, 2]. They derive results for convex, strongly convex, and non-convex objectives, offering theoretical convergence rates and matching lower bounds where applicable.

Result: SGD achieves minimax optimal convergence rates in convex and strongly convex regimes, as well as convergence rates for non-convex objectives under specific smoothness conditions. Mini-batch SGD is also shown to perform well under these conditions with potential improvements in the smoothness constant.

Conclusion: The findings establish vanilla SGD as a robust optimization method even under heavy-tailed noise, contradicting the belief that such noise severely hampers its effectiveness. The results elevate SGD as a theoretically sound baseline across numerous challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale
optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common
in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly
understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid
of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse
stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded
$p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence
guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex
problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal
sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex
regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex
objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary
point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement
this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial
step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under
standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it
also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample
complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These
results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD
ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled
baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.

### [420] [Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Constrained Biclustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05493)
*Antonio M. Sudoso*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper develops methods for biclustering with constraints, solving the k-densest disjoint biclique problem, using both exact algorithms and efficient heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorporating background knowledge into clustering is important for improving solution quality and interpretability, and extending this to biclustering allows for guided grouping of rows and columns in data.

Method: The paper proposes an exact branch-and-cut algorithm using semidefinite programming and a heuristic method based on low-rank factorization and augmented Lagrangian optimization.

Result: The exact method was effective compared to general-purpose solvers, and the heuristic method offered high-quality, efficient solutions for large datasets.

Conclusion: Both proposed approaches provide a robust framework for solving constrained biclustering problems, advancing tools for machine learning and optimization.

Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering,
simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal
submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into
clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted
growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research.
Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the
joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with
pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which
specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a
model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint
biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite
subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing
the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact
and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation,
strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion.
Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions
into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we
introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the
SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented
Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a
block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly
outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality
solutions efficiently on large instances.

### [421] [Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445)
*Costas Smaragdakis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network designed to create quadrature rules for integration over non-uniform point clouds, improving upon standard Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately integrating over non-uniform point clouds, a key aspect for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for PDEs using variational principles, motivates this research.

Method: The authors develop a GNN architecture, QuadrANN, leveraging deep message-passing schemes and geometric feature encoding to compute adaptive and permutation-invariant quadrature weights.

Result: QuadrANN demonstrates reduced variance in integral estimations, addressing singularities and enhancing performance compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: QuadrANN improves numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds, benefiting energy functional optimization and modern deep learning variational solvers for PDEs.

Abstract: Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge
for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC)
methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural
network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating
quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature
weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of
the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer
encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as
well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers
incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the
QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is
permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall
domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,
including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the
solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,
QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in
critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This
enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the
optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based
variational solvers.
