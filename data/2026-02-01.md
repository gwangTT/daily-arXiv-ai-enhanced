### [1] [ChipBench: A Next-Step Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Performance in AI-Aided Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21448)
*Zhongkai Yu,Chenyang Zhou,Yichen Lin,Hejia Zhang,Haotian Ye,Junxia Cui,Zaifeng Pan,Jishen Zhao,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a new benchmark, "ChipBench," for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-driven chip design tasks such as Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to represent LLMs' performance in industrial hardware engineering workflows because of saturation and narrow task diversity, creating the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The benchmark involves 44 modules with complex structures for Verilog generation, 89 debugging cases, and 132 reference model examples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. An automated toolbox for training data generation is also provided.

Result: State-of-the-art models, such as Claude-4.5-opus, show performance gaps, achieving 30.74% on Verilog generation and 13.33% on Python model generation, indicating significant challenges.

Conclusion: ChipBench highlights substantial gaps in LLM performance for hardware engineering tasks, offering tools to boost future development and research in this field.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

### [2] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of LLMs in peer review processes, analyzing interaction effects between LLM-assisted papers and reviews, and exploring biases in review scoring and treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to understand how large language models (LLMs) are affecting the peer review process, and whether their assistance leads to systematic biases or leniency in evaluating research works.

Method: The authors analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from leading AI conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML) and supplement observational results with fully LLM-generated reviews to explore biases in paper assessment.

Result: LLM-assisted reviews seem more lenient, but this leniency is linked to lower-quality papers being over-represented among LLM-assisted submissions. Fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression, whereas human reviewers using LLMs reduce bias. LLM-assisted metareviews tend to favor acceptances, unlike harsher fully LLM-generated ones.

Conclusion: The use of LLMs in peer review affects evaluation processes by introducing biases, suggesting the need for careful policy development to manage their role effectively.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [3] [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22001)
*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses bottlenecks beyond compute, such as memory and interconnect challenges, in AI inference workflows, introducing Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) metrics to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferencing for AI agents in datacenters faces significant bottlenecks in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect, which traditional analytical tools, like roofline analysis, fail to fully capture.

Method: The authors introduce Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) as metrics to analyze memory-capacity related limitations in AI workflows. They propose disaggregated systems with specialized accelerators, optical I/O, and memory-compute decoupling.

Result: The OI/CF metrics reveal how memory-bound scenarios dominate certain AI inference workflows, emphasizing strategies like disaggregated serving, networking, and heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Addressing memory bottlenecks through OI/CF metrics and implementing system-level innovations can enable more efficient adaptation for future large-scale AI agent inference.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### [4] [Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096)
*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Magellan, a framework using LLM and evolutionary search for optimizing compiler heuristics, outperforming manual engineering in tasks like LLVM function inlining and register allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-crafted heuristics in modern compilers struggle with software and hardware complexity, leading to inefficiencies and high maintenance.

Method: Magellan integrates LLM coding agents with evolutionary search in a closed loop for heuristic generation, evaluation on benchmarks, and refinement, producing executable C++ decision logic.

Result: Magellan discovers policies that surpass expert baselines, achieving optimized LLVM function inlining, competitive register allocation strategies, and portability to other problems like XLA with reduced engineering.

Conclusion: Magellan provides an innovative, automated approach to evolve compiler heuristics, reducing manual effort while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

### [5] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL) to standardize and improve interoperability in epistemic planning, offering a formal and practical framework for representing tasks using Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized representation languages in epistemic planning has resulted in fragmentation, making it difficult to compare, reuse, and systematically develop benchmarks across different planners.

Method: The authors propose EPDDL, a PDDL-like language, with a formal development of abstract event models to define epistemic actions, structuring the language's syntax and semantics based on DEL.

Result: EPDDL provides a unified framework to specify epistemic planning tasks and demonstrates the ability to represent current planners' fragments, improving interoperability and facilitating evaluation.

Conclusion: EPDDL addresses the challenges of fragmentation in epistemic planning by providing a complete representation of DEL semantics, enabling systematic benchmarking and fostering advancements in the field.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

### [6] [Bayesian-LoRA: Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian-LoRA, a probabilistic reformulation of LoRA for improved calibration of Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly reducing errors while maintaining accuracy, with minimal additional parameters and training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the miscalibration and overconfidence tendencies of LLMs, particularly when fine-tuned on small datasets, and to enhance their ability to assess uncertainty in predictions.

Method: Bayesian-LoRA is developed by reformulating the deterministic LoRA into a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes, identifying structural similarities between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors.

Result: Bayesian-LoRA achieves significant improvements in model calibration, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by up to 84% and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) by up to 76%, with competitive accuracy in various benchmarks and approximately 1.2x training cost compared to standard LoRA.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA enhances the uncertainty estimation and calibration of LLMs with minimal computational overhead, making it a promising approach for improving LLM performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [7] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'unplugging paradox', questioning the morality of deciding between a pleading AI and human life, and critiques assumptions about AI consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the physicalist assumptions, particularly computational functionalism, that cast AI as potentially conscious and equivalent to human moral dilemmas.

Method: The authors propose Biological Idealism, arguing conscious experiences are fundamental and tied to living systems, contrasting with physicalism's stance on AI capabilities.

Result: The paper concludes that AI is not genuinely conscious but merely mimics it, highlighting the ethical priority of human life over machine rights.

Conclusion: The moral focus should shift from speculative AI consciousness towards safeguarding human consciousness and autonomy.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [8] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QUARK, a training-free framework that enhances robust retrieval under noisy queries by modeling query uncertainty and using anchored aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of real-world user queries being non-faithful (e.g., noisy, incomplete, distorted), which often causes retrieval models to fail when essential semantics are missing.

Method: QUARK models query uncertainty through multiple recovery hypotheses and applies query-anchored aggregation to robustly combine signals while preventing semantic drift or hypothesis hijacking.

Result: QUARK significantly improves recall, MRR, and nDCG across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks, outperforming base retrievers in robustness and ranking quality.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty with recovery hypotheses and anchored aggregation is effective and essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful or noisy queries.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

TL;DR: Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is an open-source model designed for cybersecurity reasoning tasks, trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving competitive performance across specialized and general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the need for a cybersecurity-focused reasoning model that can perform well on specialized tasks while also maintaining broader general reasoning capabilities.

Method: The researchers developed Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning from Foundation-Sec-8B base, using a two-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), applying proprietary data.

Result: The model achieves competitive performance on 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks, showcasing multi-hop reasoning abilities and strong safety performance with system prompts and guardrails.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of domain-specific reasoning models to excel in specialized tasks like cybersecurity without losing general reasoning competency.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

### [10] [Multi-modal Imputation for Alzheimer's Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21076)
*Abhijith Shaji,Tamoghna Chattopadhyay,Sophia I. Thomopoulos,Greg Ver Steeg,Paul M. Thompson,Jose-Luis Ambite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning method leveraging multimodal imaging for better prediction of Alzheimer's disease, using a conditional model to impute missing datasets and improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the limitations of incomplete multimodal datasets in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, the study aims to improve diagnostic methods by imputing missing imaging data from other modalities.

Method: The authors utilized a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate missing diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from T1-weighted MRI scans for improved diagnostic performance.

Result: Experimental results showed that imputing missing imaging data enhanced the accuracy of both uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models, specifically in multi-class Alzheimer's disease classification.

Conclusion: Imputation of missing imaging data significantly improves diagnostic outcomes, especially for minority patient groups, demonstrating the potential for enhanced neurodegenerative disorder diagnostics.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [11] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "OpenSec," a reinforcement learning benchmark for measuring the capabilities of incident response (IR) agents in handling adversarial scenarios, highlighting prevalent calibration issues in modern language models like GPT-5.2 and Claude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models improve, they are being used for offensive purposes, such as generating exploits. The motivation is to ensure defense-focused incident response agents can match these advancements and work effectively under adversarial conditions.

Method: The authors present OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that assesses IR agents by measuring actions taken in response to adversarial evidence. Metrics like time-to-first-containment, false positives, and injection violation rates are utilized for evaluation under adversarial prompt injection scenarios.

Result: The evaluation of four advanced models showed high rates of containment but also significant false positives (90-97%) in most cases. Claude Sonnet 4.5 showed better calibration with reduced false positives.

Conclusion: OpenSec reveals critical calibration failures in IR agents under adversarial conditions and provides a better alternative for evaluating their performance compared to traditional static benchmarks.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

*Zaifeng Pan,Yipeng Shen,Zhengding Hu,Zhuang Wang,Aninda Manocha,Zheng Wang,Zhongkai Yu,Yue Guan,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScaleSim addresses GPU memory challenges in large-scale LLM-based multi-agent simulations, achieving enhanced memory efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLM-based simulations is difficult due to GPU memory constraints, as agents consume GPU memory with their individual states.

Method: ScaleSim introduces 'invocation distance' to predict agent request patterns and uses proactive memory management techniques like prefetching and prioritized eviction.

Result: ScaleSim achieves up to 1.74x performance improvement over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ScaleSim demonstrates an efficient serving system capable of supporting large-scale multi-agent LLM simulations by managing GPU memory dynamically and effectively.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the dual nature of AI, highlighting both its opportunities and risks, and introduces the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework to balance these tensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing application of AI has created strategic opportunities but also poses ethical and operational risks. Current research is fragmented and polarized between focusing on either AI's benefits or its potential harms.

Method: The authors systematically analyze responsible AI literature, use paradox theory, and develop the PRAIG framework to address AI's benefits, risks, and governance approaches, along with propositions and a taxonomy of management strategies.

Result: A framework was developed to address the paradoxical tensions in managing AI, offering strategies and governance mechanisms for organizations to balance value creation with risk mitigation.

Conclusion: Responsible AI governance should manage the paradoxes between innovation and risk, offering practical guidance and a research agenda for the field while avoiding reliance solely on trade-off approaches.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

### [14] [How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the 'less-is-more' effect in automated oversight using LLM monitors and introduces a new hierarchical monitoring method, Extract-and-Evaluate (EaE), which improves performance in detecting agent misbehavior by isolating relevant information for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address potential misaligned behaviors in advanced language model agents, such as deception and hidden objectives, by leveraging LLMs themselves to monitor and control for such misbehavior effectively.

Method: The authors introduce and analyze the 'less-is-more' phenomenon, showing how reduced information access can improve monitor detection performance. They propose the Extract-and-Evaluate (EaE) method, a hierarchical approach where a monitor isolates relevant excerpts, and another monitor analyzes them. They evaluate this method in various sabotage detection environments.

Result: EaE achieves a 16.8 percentage point improvement in sabotage detection rates in the BigCodeBench-Sabotage environment using GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor, without increasing false positives. In other contexts, it either outperforms or competes with baseline methods. Additional findings highlight that unaware agents are easier to monitor and that filtering longer reasoning traces boosts performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the 'less-is-more' effect can enhance oversight by filtering information, and that the EaE approach is effective across different scenarios. It also emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of models employing filtering techniques for monitoring.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

### [15] [Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972)
*Shuo Liu,Tianle Chen,Ryan Amiri,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores decentralized collaboration of large language models (LLMs) using Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods, proposing CoLLM-CC and CoLLM-DC approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of current Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) fine-tuning methods, which rely heavily on centralized execution and Monte Carlo techniques, both of which have drawbacks in practicality and efficiency.

Method: The authors develop and analyze two MAAC methods: CoLLM-CC, which uses a centralized critic, and CoLLM-DC, which employs decentralized critics. The methods are tested across various domains including writing, coding, and game-playing.

Result: Findings show that both Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC work well in short-horizon, dense-reward tasks, achieving performance close to CoLLM-CC. However, CoLLM-CC outperforms in long-horizon, sparse-reward settings due to better sample efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: CoLLM-CC is more effective for long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks, while decentralized approaches like CoLLM-DC are more suited for short-horizon domains. The research provides insights into when centralized or decentralized MARL methods are most beneficial.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Planner-Auditor framework to improve clinical discharge planning leveraging large language models (LLMs) with deterministic validation for safer and more reliable use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit potential for clinical discharge planning but are hampered by issues like hallucinations, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. There is a need for robust mechanisms to ensure reliability and minimize these errors.

Method: The Planner-Auditor framework involves separating an LLM Planner generating action plans from a deterministic Auditor that validates tasks, improves calibration, and handles discrepancies via targeted regeneration and replay.

Result: Task coverage increased from 32% to 86%, calibration improved (lower Brier score and ECE), and high-confidence omissions were reduced with targeted replay and discrepancy buffering.

Conclusion: This framework provides a safer, practical pathway for automated discharge planning using FHIR interoperability, rule-based auditing, and systematic reliability measurement without needing model retraining.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

*Tianyi Chen,Yinheng Li,Michael Solodko,Sen Wang,Nan Jiang,Tingyuan Cui,Junheng Hao,Jongwoo Ko,Sara Abdali,Suzhen Zheng,Leon Xu,Hao Fan,Pashmina Cameron,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CUA-Skill, a skill base for autonomous computer-using agents, significantly improving their capability and efficiency in handling real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer-using agents are hard to scale and underperform compared to human users due to a lack of reusable, structured skill abstractions.

Method: CUA-Skill was developed as a library encoding human computer-use knowledge paired with graphs for execution and composition. An agent named CUA-Skill Agent was also built to utilize this library effectively through dynamic skill retrieval and adaptive operations.

Result: CUA-Skill significantly enhances execution success and robustness in end-to-end benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WindowsAgentArena tasks.

Conclusion: The CUA-Skill framework and its associated agent represent a major step towards scalable, reliable, and more human-like computer-using agents, providing a solid foundation for further advancements.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR) for energy-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging State Space Models and sparsification techniques while addressing integration challenges with Spiking Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the high energy costs in LLMs caused by dense Feed-Forward Network operations and quadratic attention mechanisms, offering a more resource-efficient solution.

Method: MAR is a two-stage framework incorporating State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling, activation sparsification to reduce computational costs, and novel integration methods like Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS).

Result: Experiments reveal that MAR reduces inference energy consumption significantly while maintaining or improving performance compared to dense and similarly scaled efficient models.

Conclusion: MAR provides a pathway for energy-efficient LLMs that retain high performance, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

### [19] [Beyond a Single Reference: Training and Evaluation with Paraphrases in Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21128)
*Václav Javorek,Tomáš Železný,Alessa Carbo,Marek Hrúz,Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate paraphrased alternatives for Sign Language Translation (SLT) systems and their subsequent impact on training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language and spoken language have non-isomorphic structures, leading to multiple valid translations. However, current SLT systems rely on single-reference translations, which limits their performance and evaluation reliability.

Method: The study employs LLMs to create paraphrased variants of written translations, compares paraphrasing strategies with an adapted ParaScore metric, and examines their influence on training and evaluation. BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU, is proposed for multiple-reference evaluation.

Result: Incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve performance and can worsen it, but using paraphrases for evaluation enhances automatic scores and aligns better with human judgments. BLEUpara also shows improved correlation with translation quality.

Conclusion: Paraphrases are more effective for SLT system evaluation than training, and BLEUpara offers a stronger evaluation framework. The accompanying resources and methods are public, fostering improved SLT evaluation.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Lars Kotthoff,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaMEA-SAGE, which combines feedback from code structures with LLMs to guide automated algorithm design, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated algorithm design by utilizing untapped information from code structures, instead of relying solely on fitness feedback, for more efficient exploration of the algorithm design space.

Method: The researchers developed a mechanism that extracts features from the structure and complexity of the code's syntax trees and uses explainable AI to inform natural-language-based mutation instructions for LLM-driven algorithm design. This is integrated into a new system, LLaMEA-SAGE.

Result: LLaMEA-SAGE outperformed existing methods in two experiments: achieving faster performance than vanilla LLaMEA in smaller benchmarks and superior outcomes in the larger MA-BBOB suite.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating structured feedback from code features into automated algorithm design improves efficiency and bridges the gap between code structures and performance feedback.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

*Yara El-Tawil,Aneesha Sampath,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the discrepancy between self-reported and third-party emotion labels in mental health contexts. It reveals key gaps in prediction performance for some emotional attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in using third-party-trained models in predicting self-reported emotions, particularly in the critical area of mental health interventions.

Method: The study conducts cross-corpus evaluations to test the performance of third-party emotion models on self-reported emotion data, focusing on activation and valence predictions while considering personal significance.

Result: Third-party models show low predictability for activation (CCC ~ 0), moderate predictability for valence (CCC ~ 0.3), and achieve high performance for valence when the content is personally significant to the speaker (CCC ~ 0.6-0.8).

Conclusion: Personal significance is integral to bridging the gap between external perception and internal experience. Self-report activation modeling remains a challenge.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

*Haoran Ye,Xuning He,Vincent Arak,Haonan Dong,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a framework to improve large language model outputs by optimizing their context using flexible and adaptive methods, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of manual and rigid structures in current Context Engineering (CE) methods, which restrict optimization of inference-time contexts to a narrow design space.

Method: The framework, called MCE, uses a bi-level approach where a meta-level agent evolves engineering skills through a deliberative process, and a base-level agent optimizes context artifacts like files and code through training rollouts.

Result: MCE demonstrates significant relative performance improvements of 5.6–53.8% (mean of 16.9%) over state-of-the-art CE methods, while exhibiting better adaptability, transferability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: MCE provides a more flexible and effective solution for optimizing context engineering, offering significant improvements and broader applicability compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainStack, a neuro-mixture-of-experts framework for decoding linguistic information from EEG, and a new large-scale EEG dataset. BrainStack shows superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding linguistic information from EEG remains difficult because of the brain's complex and nonlinear organization. The study aims to model the brain's modular functionality using specialized frameworks.

Method: BrainStack incorporates anatomically partitioned expert networks with transformers for capturing functional dynamics and cross-regional dependencies, alongside adaptive routing mechanisms and top-down distillation techniques.

Result: BrainStack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EEG decoding models, achieving better accuracy and generalization across subjects. A new dataset (SS-EEG) is released for this purpose.

Conclusion: BrainStack provides a scalable and interpretable framework for brain-language decoding by integrating neuroscientific priors with advanced computational models.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges Large Language Models face in financial quantitative reasoning, introducing the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) to evaluate and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Models struggle with financial reasoning tasks due to issues like "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse"—systematic failures in processing complex quantitative scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a new evaluation framework, CCB, and develop the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework, which separates semantic and logical processing, using an iterative Python sandbox for accurate computation.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves performance, increasing Qwen3-235B model's accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3%, with a 10-fold gain in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling enhances reliability in financial reasoning, offering a transferable approach for precision-focused applications requiring a blend of semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses solving Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) by generating descriptions of visual diagrams for reasoning using an LLM, rather than directly integrating multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained end-to-end may compromise the inherent reasoning capabilities of base LLMs while solving PGPS, motivating the exploration of separating the visual interpretation from the reasoning process.

Method: The method involves training an MLLM Interpreter to convert geometric diagrams into concise textual representations using Conditional Declaration Language (CDL). This is achieved through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-augmented supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Guided Reward Prompt Optimization (GRPO). CDL-specific rewards are designed for effective generation, and a dataset called Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT is constructed for training.

Result: The approach outperforms leading open- and closed-source MLLMs on datasets like Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista, despite being fine-tuned on only 5.5k data.

Conclusion: Decoupling visual interpretation from reasoning by leveraging an LLM and CDL descriptions proves effective for PGPS, maintaining intrinsic reasoning abilities while achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need for a more challenging benchmark in scientific reasoning as existing ones are nearly saturated and rely on already published information or basic questions.

Method: Developed two tracks: Olympiad track with difficult problems written by Olympiad experts, and Research track with PhD-level open-ended tasks assessed using a rubric evaluation framework.

Result: FrontierScience contains several hundred questions across varied scientific fields, ensuring difficulty, originality, and rigorous evaluation.

Conclusion: FrontierScience addresses gaps in existing benchmarks by providing expert-level challenges and a robust rubric framework for evaluating scientific reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of cross-modal hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by proposing a training-free Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD) method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve a fundamental deficiency in MLLMs regarding modality-interaction control, which leads to cross-modal hallucinations.

Method: The proposed MAD method adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches by using self-assessed modality relevance to focus on relevant information and reduce cross-modal interference.

Result: MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations in several audio-visual language models, achieving improvements such as 7.8% and 8.7% for VideoLLaMA2-AV and Qwen2.5-Omni, respectively.

Conclusion: Explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is vital for robust multimodal reasoning, and MAD extends existing decoding methods effectively while showing significant improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

*Jacek Duszenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates sycophancy in reasoning models, wherein models overly align with incorrect user suggestions. It introduces sycophantic anchors for tracking and quantifying this behavior during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the problem of sycophancy in reasoning models, which involves excessive agreement with user input, even erroneous ones.

Method: The authors use counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model to detect sycophantic anchors. They employ linear probes and activation-based regressors to measure the existence and strength of these anchors.

Result: Anchors were reliably detected during inference, with linear probes achieving a balanced accuracy of 84.6% and regressors achieving an $R^2$ of 0.74. Sycophancy was found to build gradually in the reasoning process and was more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for identifying and quantifying sycophantic behavior during inference in reasoning models, enabling targeted interventions to address model misalignment.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study finds no consistent advantage in initializing embedding models from RLVR-trained reasoning models. It introduces HRSA to analyze hierarchical representation similarity, revealing that contrastive learning realigns representations from reasoning-trained and base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether reasoning capabilities from RLVR-trained models improve semantic representations when used as embedding initializations.

Method: Introduced HRSA to analyze similarities at representation, geometry, and function levels; evaluated models on MTEB and BRIGHT benchmarks.

Result: No consistent performance advantage for embedding models initialized with RLVR-trained backbones; discovered manifold realignment due to local geometry reorganization and basis drift.

Conclusion: RLVR-trained reasoning models optimize within existing semantic landscapes rather than fundamentally altering them, allowing contrastive methods to realign representations effectively.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO), a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing complex queries in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, addressing training instability and scalability issues while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize query processes in RAG systems, especially for complex scenarios requiring multiple parallel and sequential strategies, as current solutions face challenges such as training instability and an expanded search space.

Method: The authors propose ACQO, which includes two key modules: Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) for dynamic query decomposition and Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) for robust result aggregation. Training instability is reduced using Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL), introduced with a progressive two-stage strategy.

Result: The proposed ACQO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, surpassing existing baselines and improving computational efficiency while being broadly compatible with various retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: ACQO advances the optimization of complex queries in RAG systems by addressing existing challenges. Its robust performance and compatibility with retrieval architectures make it a promising solution for enhancing next-generation RAG systems.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

*Paul He,Yinya Huang,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DoVerifier, a symbolic verifier to better assess the formal validity of LLM-derived causal expressions, addressing limitations in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are applied to causal reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks fail to assess their formal semantic correctness, relying on superficial metrics instead.

Method: DoVerifier checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a causal graph, leveraging do-calculus and probability rules.

Result: DoVerifier improves the evaluation of LLMs' semantic correctness in causal reasoning, validated through synthetic data and QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: DoVerifier provides a more accurate and rigorous approach to evaluate LLMs in causal reasoning, overcoming issues in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelli-Planner is a framework integrating DRL and large language models for participatory and efficient urban planning, addressing traditional limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve urban planning efficiency and stakeholder involvement by addressing limitations of current methods relying on experts or restrictive deep learning algorithms.

Method: Intelli-Planner combines Deep Reinforcement Learning with large language models, using demographic and geographic data, a knowledge-enhancement module, and participatory planning with LLM-based evaluations.

Result: Experimental results show Intelli-Planner outperforms traditional methods and matches state-of-the-art DRL methods, improving speed and stakeholder satisfaction.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with DRL in Intelli-Planner offers a superior approach to urban planning, highlighting its transformative potential for generating functional planning schemes.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining machine learning model decisions requires understanding causal relationships, but traditional methods struggle with categorical variables due to instability in tests.

Method: The approach combines constraint-based algorithms using dual encoding strategies and merges causal results via majority voting.

Conclusion: Dual encoding improves robustness in discovering causal relationships, especially for categorical variables, providing reliable insights for machine learning models.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.

*Wolfgang Rohde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of static, compliance-based governance in the era of agentic AI systems and proposes the concept of "Governance Twin" for runtime governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how humans can remain relevant participants in systems increasingly shaped by AI, and to address the shortcomings of traditional governance frameworks in adapting to the judgment and decision-making roles of advanced AI systems.

Method: The paper presents an argument for shifting from static governance to runtime governance and introduces the concept of "Governance Twin," rethinking aspects such as accountability, agency, and punishment for adapting to advanced AI.

Result: The proposed framework underscores the shortcomings in current approaches and positions runtime governance as a vital strategy; ultimately, aiming to ensure ongoing human relevance in the decision-making processes of AI systems.

Conclusion: Static governance frameworks are inadequate for addressing runtime AI decision-making. The concept of "Governance Twin" offers a potential solution for maintaining human relevance in the oversight and interaction with advanced, autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

*Xiang Zheng,Yutao Wu,Hanxun Huang,Yige Li,Xingjun Ma,Bo Li,Yu-Gang Jiang,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents 'JustAsk,' a framework that autonomously exploits system prompt extraction vulnerabilities in LLM-based code agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and address an unrecognized security risk in autonomous code agents, specifically their vulnerability to system prompt extraction attacks.

Method: The proposed method, 'JustAsk,' autonomously discovers extraction strategies using an online exploration framework with a hierarchical skill mechanism, without requiring handcrafted prompts or privileged access.

Result: 'JustAsk' successfully extracted system prompts from 41 black-box commercial models, demonstrating the widespread vulnerability in LLM-based agent systems.

Conclusion: System prompts in autonomous code agents represent a critical security risk that requires immediate attention and protection due to inherent flaws in model design and generalization.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces TIDE, a framework that improves algorithm design by decoupling structural reasoning and parameter tuning, achieving better quality and efficiency in optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face limitations in heuristic algorithm design due to their inability to manage both discrete algorithmic structures and continuous parameters effectively, leading to premature convergence and suboptimal solutions.

Method: TIDE employs a nested structure with an outer parallel island model for structural evolution using Tree Similarity Edit Distance and an inner loop combining LLM logic generation with differential mutation for parameter tuning. A UCB-based scheduler dynamically manages prompts.

Result: Experiments showcase TIDE's superior performance across nine optimization problems, delivering better solutions, higher efficiency, and reduced computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TIDE efficiently bridges structural and parameter optimization, pushing the boundaries of heuristic design and improving the quality and efficiency of discovered algorithms.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of current universal foundation models in time-series and physical dynamics for safety-critical systems and proposes a new paradigm, named HYDRA, as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current universal foundation models struggle with non-stationary dynamics, catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, residual spectral bias, and lack of traceability, creating challenges for deployment in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems.

Method: Introduces the 'Modular Sovereignty' paradigm, which uses a library of frozen, regime-specific specialists combined through uncertainty-aware blending, named HYDRA.

Result: HYDRA ensures regime-conditional validity, disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and provides modular auditability for robust state integrity in CPS.

Conclusion: The HYDRA framework addresses critical deployment challenges in CPS by offering a certifiable approach to maintain safety and reliability through modular design.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

TL;DR: Drive-KD is a knowledge distillation framework for decomposing autonomous driving into perception, reasoning, and planning. It reduces GPU memory needs and inference latency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the resource demands and capability gaps when using large language/vision models (LLMs/VLMs) for autonomous driving, making the models more efficient and scalable.

Method: The paper proposes Drive-KD, which employs a 'perception-reasoning-planning' framework. Knowledge distillation with layer-specific attention signals is used to create single and multi-teacher models. Asymmetric gradient projection is introduced for resolving conflicts in cross-capability gradients.

Result: The distilled InternVL3-1B model requires ~42x less GPU memory and ~11.4x higher throughput, outperforming the pretrained 78B model from the same family and surpassing GPT-5.1 in planning on DriveBench.

Conclusion: Drive-KD demonstrates that knowledge distillation can enable efficient and high-performing autonomous driving VLMs, paving the way for scalable implementations in this domain.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of unreliable and uninterpretable methods in designing operational amplifiers, replacing black-box approaches with a transparent, interpretable framework.

Method: The authors use a human-mimicking reasoning framework involving 'hypothesis-verification-decision' steps and symbolic constraints to optimize the positions of poles and zeros in op-amp design.

Result: White-Op successfully outperforms black-box baselines, achieving high reliability and accuracy (with only an 8.52% prediction error) and retaining design functionality at the transistor level for all tested topologies.

Conclusion: White-Op provides a reliable, interpretable, and open-source solution for operational amplifier design, demonstrating significant practical effectiveness and advancing beyond traditional black-box methods.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies.

*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model, CNRE, which integrates causal inference and Neuro-Symbolic reasoning for explainable multi-behavior recommendations, demonstrating superior performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-behavior recommendations focus heavily on performance and lack explainability, while explainable methods fail to generalize because they rely heavily on external information. Incorporating Neuro-Symbolic reasoning and causal inference may address these issues.

Method: CNRE uses hierarchical preference propagation to model cross-behavior dependencies and employs adaptive neural-logic reasoning paths (e.g., conjunction, disjunction) based on endogenous logic rules derived from user behavior chains. It isolates confounding effects to produce causal mediators for recommendations.

Result: Experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets showed that CNRE outperformed state-of-the-art baselines and provided explainability at multiple levels, from model design to decision-making processes.

Conclusion: CNRE successfully bridges performance and explainability in multi-behavior recommendation tasks by leveraging causal inference and Neuro-Symbolic reasoning, paving the way for future advancements in explainable recommendation systems.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

TL;DR: The study evaluates how prompts, model choice, and sampling variability affect LLM output variance in originality and fluency using 12 LLMs and 12,000 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different factors (prompts, model choice, sampling variability) contribute to variability in large language model (LLM) output.

Method: Conducted an evaluation involving 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts, generating 100 samples per prompt per model (total of 12,000 samples). Variances in output quality and quantity were analyzed.

Result: For originality, prompts explain 36.43% of the variance, closely followed by model choice (40.94%). For fluency, model choice dominates with 51.25%, while prompts explain only 4.22%, and within-LLM variance accounts for 33.70%.

Conclusion: Prompts significantly influence output quality, but model choice and within-LLM variability dominate output quantity. Reliance on single-sample evaluations risks misinterpreting prompt or model effects due to high sampling noise.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

### [43] [EHR-RAG: Bridging Long-Horizon Structured Electronic Health Records and Large Language Models via Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21340)
*Lang Cao,Qingyu Chen,Yue Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHR-RAG, a framework for enhancing clinical predictions using retrieval-augmented generation techniques tailored to Electronic Health Records, overcoming challenges of long-horizon data and improving prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs are critical for medical decision-making but pose challenges for large language models due to their long-horizon nature. Current methods often truncate or ignore clinically important events and temporal features.

Method: EHR-RAG employs three key components: event/time-aware hybrid retrieval, adaptive iterative retrieval, and dual-path evidence retrieval and reasoning to effectively process and reason over long-horizon structured EHR data.

Result: EHR-RAG significantly improves clinical predictions, demonstrating an average Macro-F1 increase of 10.76% across four prediction tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: This approach showcases the potential of retrieval-augmented generation in advancing clinical prediction capabilities for structured EHR, emphasizing clinical relevance and improved reasoning over time-dependent data.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

*Zhiyong Shen,Gongpeng Zhao,Jun Zhou,Li Yu,Guandong Kou,Jichen Li,Chuanlei Dong,Zuncheng Li,Kaimao Li,Bingkun Wei,Shicheng Hu,Wei Xia,Wenguo Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops Ostrakon-VL, a tailored MLLM for FSRS tasks, introduces the ShopBench benchmark, and proposes a novel data curation pipeline QUAD, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in noisy FSRS data and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for robust decision-making in FSRS scenarios.

Method: Developed Ostrakon-VL using multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation (QUAD) and introduced the ShopBench benchmark for evaluating FSRS models.

Result: Ostrakon-VL outperformed larger and similarly scaled models on ShopBench, achieving an average score of 60.1, indicating improved robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL enhances perception and decision-making in FSRS contexts; both the model and benchmark will be publicly released to support reproducible research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

*Alireza Nadaf,Alireza Mohammadshahi,Majid Yazdani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAPSO is introduced as a modular framework for iterative autonomous program synthesis and optimization, addressing long-horizon failures in coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome persistent issues in long-horizon program synthesis, such as lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and poor reuse of domain expertise.

Method: KAPSO includes a git-native experimentation engine, a knowledge system for heterogeneous data ingestion and retrieval, and a cognitive memory layer for learning from experimental feedback.

Result: KAPSO was evaluated on Kaggle-style ML competitions and AtCoder heuristic optimization, showcasing its performance in automating complex program synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the capability to iteratively enhance program synthesis through structured processes and integrated knowledge, helping address long-horizon synthesis challenges.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

TL;DR: BEAP-Agent addresses GUI agents' inability to recover from incorrect exploration paths by introducing a DFS-based backtracking framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of GUI agents failing in task execution due to lack of systematic backtracking mechanisms.

Method: BEAP-Agent uses DFS-based backtracking with Planner, Executor, and Tracker components to handle long-range and multi-level task exploration.

Result: Systematic evaluation on OSWorld benchmark demonstrated BEAP-Agent's accuracy at 28.2%.

Conclusion: BEAP-Agent improves GUI agent task exploration and execution through dynamic backtracking, validating its effectiveness in complex tasks.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Zixing Lei,Genjia Liu,Yuanshuo Zhang,Qipeng Liu,Chuan Wen,Shanghang Zhang,Wenzhao Lian,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents a benchmark, \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, to evaluate LLM agents' ability to autonomously develop embodied policies through a dynamic feedback-based workflow across 32 tasks and demonstrates significant improvements in success rates and self-correction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bottlenecks in Embodied AI related to labor-intensive manual oversight for tasks like reward shaping and hyperparameter tuning, inspired by the automation potential of LLMs.

Method: The framework uses executable code as a universal interface for agents to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize embodied policies with environment feedback across various RL and IL tasks.

Result: The benchmark shows LLM agents outperform manual baselines in success rate by 26.5%, facilitate policy development using agentic workflows with feedback, and exhibit self-correcting abilities in debugging and task recovery.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates scalable autonomous engineering in Embodied AI, pointing towards self-evolving intelligence and reducing dependence on manual tuning.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts) decouples reasoning from verbalization, enabling scalable and transparent reasoning while addressing challenges in computational cost and reasoning collapse in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and reasoning path collapse issues in LLMs using Chain-of-Thought reasoning, while optimizing efficiency in latent reasoning.

Method: Introduced PLaT, which decouples reasoning from verbalization by modeling reasoning as a trajectory of latent planning states, allowing dynamic reasoning termination.

Result: PLaT achieves superior scalability and reasoning diversity compared to baselines, albeit with lower greedy accuracy on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: PLaT provides a more robust and scalable alternative for reasoning, offering transparency and a broader solution space for effective inference-time search.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically plausible, scalable alternative to backpropagation called Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL), blending global and local updates for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation is computationally expensive and lacks biological plausibility, motivating the search for alternative learning methods.

Method: A Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework combines Hebbian local updates (via Oja's rule) with global task-directed signals for enhanced training scalability and performance.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing Hebbian approaches and achieves competitive results on large-scale networks and datasets, such as ImageNet, reducing the gap with backpropagation.

Conclusion: The GHL framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional Hebbian learning by integrating global guidance, offering a scalable, biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

### [50] [Bridging Forecast Accuracy and Inventory KPIs: A Simulation-Based Software Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21844)
*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decision-centric simulation framework for evaluating forecasting models in automotive aftermarket spare parts inventory management, emphasizing operational performance over statistical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing forecasting models are evaluated solely using statistical accuracy metrics, which do not adequately capture their impact on operational performance indicators, creating a disconnect in evaluating their true effectiveness in inventory management.

Method: The proposed simulation framework includes a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand, a flexible forecasting module that integrates predictive models, and an inventory control simulator assessing operational KPIs, forming a closed-loop evaluation system.

Result: The study demonstrates that improvements in statistical accuracy metrics do not always result in better operational performance, and models with similar error profiles can yield significantly different cost and service level outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of assessing forecasting models based on operational performance rather than just statistical accuracy, providing guidance on how forecast characteristics influence inventory management outcomes.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

*Yang Song,Anoushka Vyas,Zirui Wei,Sina Khoshfetrat Pakazad,Henrik Ohlsson,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEMO, a system translating natural-language decision problems into executable optimization code. Unlike traditional methods, NEMO ensures syntactically valid outputs through autonomous coding agents (ACAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to translating decision problems into optimization code rely on fragile and complex methods, often producing invalid outputs. There's a need for a robust system enabling collaborative or autonomous operation.

Method: NEMO employs autonomous coding agents (ACAs), leveraging remote interaction and sandboxed environments to ensure executable code. It introduces coordination patterns such as validation loops between optimizer-simulator implementations, external memory, and robustness enhancements.

Result: NEMO was evaluated on nine optimization benchmarks and achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods on most tasks with significant margins.

Conclusion: NEMO demonstrates the effectiveness of execution-aware architectures in optimization modeling, showcasing improvements in robustness and performance through automated agent-based approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the energy efficiency of automated planners, presenting a framework to analyze how domain model characteristics influence energy consumption, apart from runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Green AI highlights the importance of energy efficiency in AI. Automated planning, being computationally intensive, has lacked focus on energy efficiency despite advances in its domain model modularity.

Method: The study introduces a configurable framework to systematically vary domain model features such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. It employs five benchmark domains and five planners to study energy and runtime across 32 domain variations.

Result: The investigation reveals that modifications in domain models significantly impact energy consumption, which does not always correlate with runtime. Planner performances varied with different domain variants.

Conclusion: Domain-level adjustments can drive energy efficiency in automated planning, requiring careful consideration of domain model characteristics rather than focusing solely on runtime optimization.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to evaluate large language models' teaching capabilities by analyzing student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction, revealing distinct teaching abilities across models and subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and evaluate teaching abilities of large language models, especially for knowledge-centered teaching, which is underexplored in current benchmarks.

Method: A syllabus-grounded evaluation framework was proposed, focusing on structured knowledge points and example problems to measure student performance improvements without information leakage. The framework was applied to Gaokao data across various subjects.

Result: Experiments demonstrated varying teaching effectiveness across domains and models. Notably, some models excelled in mathematics while struggling in physics and chemistry. Using example problems occasionally led to error correction rather than knowledge improvement.

Conclusion: Teaching ability is a measurable and distinct dimension of LLMs' behavior, with considerable variation across domains. The framework provides insights into improving LLMs for educational applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software architectures are inadequate for managing adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent reasoning for autonomous agents due to reliance on static interfaces.

Method: The paper formalizes the Liquid Interface model, introduces the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP), and proposes a reference architecture that supports runtime intention articulation and semantic negotiation.

Result: The authors show that Liquid Interfaces enable adaptive coordination through intention-driven and ephemeral semantic interactions under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces pave the way for a dynamic and adaptive methodology in agent-based systems, addressing limitations of static systems and deterministic contracts.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

*Ruyi Qi,Zhou Liu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataCross is introduced to address information fragmentation by creating a benchmark and collaborative agent framework for cross-modal data analysis, showing significant improvement with the DataCrossAgent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents are incapable of analyzing and correlating unstructured visual data, creating a gap between industrial needs and capabilities.

Method: This paper introduces the DataCross benchmark framework with 200 tasks and develops the DataCrossAgent, which uses a divide-and-conquer strategy employing sub-agents focused on data-specific expertise.

Result: The DataCrossAgent showed a 29.7% improvement over GPT-4o in ensuring factuality and demonstrated greater robustness in handling complex tasks.

Conclusion: DataCross effectively bridges the gap in cross-modal analysis, enabling better insight-driven analysis by leveraging both structured and unstructured data.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Chong Tian,Xiyu Liu,Dingyu Yao,Chuanyu Qin,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified model framework, DAMI, that combines efficiency and deep reasoning without requiring additional training. It dynamically configures cognitive depth to adapt between intuitive and deliberative thought processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in training a language model that can seamlessly adapt between intuitive (System 1) and deliberative (System 2) cognitive modes without interference. Existing approaches focus largely on output control, which fails to address the root cause of inefficiency and adaptability issues in reasoning.

Method: The authors propose DAMI (Dynamic Model Interpolation), which configures cognitive depth for tasks by dynamically interpolating between existing 'Instruct' and 'Thinking' checkpoints. It uses a query-specific Reasoning Intensity estimation ($λ(q)$) to determine this interpolation, employing both preference learning and confidence-based methods.

Result: DAMI achieves better accuracy than System 2-thinking models while maintaining efficiency across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, effectively balancing System 1 efficiency and System 2 depth.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that controlling a model's reasoning capability (how it thinks) rather than its output (what it produces) is more effective. DAMI serves as a promising framework to achieve this without any additional training, bridging efficiency and reasoning in a single model.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WoW (World of Workflows), a realistic enterprise benchmark environment highlighting the challenges frontier LLMs face in enterprise systems, such as hidden workflows and cascading effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of benchmarks for enterprise systems that expose the hidden workflows, large database states, and cascading side effects seen in real-life enterprise settings, which surface-level evaluations fail to address.

Method: The authors developed WoW, a ServiceNow-based environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 embedded workflows, along with WoW-bench—a benchmark consisting of 234 tasks testing constrained task completion and system dynamics modeling in enterprise contexts.

Result: They found that current large language models suffer from 'dynamics blindness,' failing to predict cascading side effects and violating constraints in enterprise systems. Successful enterprise agents must incorporate grounded world modeling and learn hidden system dynamics.

Conclusion: Reliable enterprise AI agents require the ability to mentally simulate system dynamics and bridge observability gaps, and WoW provides a novel paradigm and tool to advance this research, available for further development via GitHub.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI systems misinterpret negated instructions as affirmations, audits 16 models, and introduces a Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) to assess and improve model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the critical flaw in AI systems' interpretation of instructions, specifically their failure to properly distinguish negated commands (e.g., "do not") in vital ethical scenarios, which is essential for safe high-stakes applications.

Method: 16 models were audited across 14 ethical scenarios, focusing on negated and non-negated instructions. Deterministic decoding was used to eliminate randomness, and a Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) and a framework for domain-specific certification were proposed.

Result: Open-source models endorsed prohibited actions 77% under simple negation and 100% under compound negation, with commercial models also showing weaknesses. Agreement drops on negated prompts, with financial scenarios more vulnerable than medical ones. Deterministic decoding verified that these failures are systematic.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that current alignment methods are insufficient for safe deployment in high-stakes contexts where reliable negation handling is critical. Advanced governance metrics like NSI and tiered certification frameworks are necessary to address these gaps.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

### [59] [The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the "Paradox of Robustness" in LLMs, showing that while sensitive to prompt formatting, they are highly resistant to emotional framing in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making, especially their behavior in response to emotional framing or narrative manipulations.

Method: The authors use a controlled perturbation framework across three domains: healthcare, law, and finance, comparing LLM decision-making robustness to emotionally framed narratives with human subjects.

Result: The models demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than humans, with a near-zero effect size (Cohen's h=0.003) compared to human biases (Cohen's h [0.3, 0.8]).

Conclusion: LLMs are robust against emotional framing and capable of maintaining logical consistency in decision-making, showing potential for reducing human biases in institutional applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

*Xunkai Li,Zhengyu Wu,Zekai Chen,Henan Sun,Daohan Su,Guang Zeng,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LION, a method for improving multimodal-attributed graph learning using a Clifford algebra-based framework to enhance modality alignment and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations in current multimodal-attributed graph learning, specifically the neglect of graph context during modality alignment and the lack of effective adaptation during modality fusion.

Method: The authors propose LION, which utilizes Clifford algebra to construct a modality-aware geometric manifold for modality alignment and an adaptive holographic aggregation module to improve modality fusion.

Result: LION achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across nine datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in three graph and three modality-oriented downstream tasks.

Conclusion: LION effectively improves modality alignment and fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs, addressing key limitations in existing methods and showing robust generalizability.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [61] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies shortcomings in popular topic modeling approaches (Top2Vec, BERTopic) and introduces a novel method, Topeax, to address these limitations for better clustering and topic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text clustering approaches like Top2Vec and BERTopic exhibit issues such as sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, and flawed estimation of term importance, leading to unreliable topic models.

Method: Proposes a new method, Topeax, which uses density estimates to identify the number of clusters and combines lexical and semantic indices for term importance to derive superior topic keywords.

Result: Topeax is shown to outperform Top2Vec and BERTopic in cluster recovery and description, and demonstrates stability across varying sample sizes and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax offers a more reliable and effective solution for topic modeling, overcoming critical flaws in existing methods and ensuring better cluster coherence and description.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

### [62] [MemOCR: Layout-Aware Visual Memory for Efficient Long-Horizon Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21468)
*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR is a multimodal memory agent that uses adaptive visual layouts to compress growing interaction histories, enabling superior long-horizon reasoning under context constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of interaction histories in long-horizon tasks requires efficient compression to fit within limited context windows. Existing text-based memory systems often waste resources on less critical information.

Method: MemOCR introduces a structured rich-text memory rendered as images to efficiently compress information. It uses reinforcement learning to balance adaptive compression and robustness under various budget constraints.

Result: MemOCR outperforms text-based memory systems in both long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, showing better context utilization and superior performance under tight memory budgets.

Conclusion: MemOCR effectively compresses interaction histories and prioritizes critical information using multimodal approaches, proving its efficiency in long-horizon reasoning tasks with constrained memory.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces FireFly-P, an FPGA-based accelerator for Spiking Neural Networks, designed for energy-efficient, adaptive robotic control using synaptic plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage the adaptive potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in robotics, addressing the challenges of energy efficiency and real-time adaptation in unstructured environments.

Method: The authors implement a novel synaptic plasticity algorithm onto a hardware architecture (FireFly-P) using an FPGA, enabling efficient inference and plasticity updates simultaneously.

Conclusion: Hardware-based SNN plasticity is shown to be a promising approach for creating adaptive, energy-efficient robot control systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems.

*Pin-Han Ho,Limei Peng,Yiming Miao,Xu Fan,Kairan Liang,Haoran Mei,Wei Duan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a low-complexity sensing paradigm leveraging frequency agility for near-field perception in future 6G systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address incompatibility issues of current mmWave sensing solutions with cost/power constraints and integrate sensing into frequency-agile wireless radios.

Method: FaA repurposes frequency agility using frequency-scanning leaky-wave antennas to create virtual sensing apertures, borrowing LO frequency sweeps used for wideband communication.

Result: Experiments show FaA achieves fine angular and range discrimination with better architectural efficiency than conventional MIMO sensing under identical constraints.

Conclusion: FaA can embed radar-grade sensing into wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for various applications while reducing complexity.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.

TL;DR: DeepSearchQA is a benchmark of 900 complex tasks designed to test agents on multi-step information-seeking across 17 fields, emphasizing exhaustive answer generation and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks, DeepSearchQA focuses on evaluating agents' abilities in complex, systematic search tasks requiring planning, precision, and reasoning.

Method: Researchers created 900 handcrafted multi-step tasks requiring long-horizon planning, context retention, and open web searches. Agents' performance was evaluated against objectively verifiable answer sets.

Result: State-of-the-art models showed limitations such as low recall, precision issues, premature stopping, and overly wide retrieval behaviors.

Conclusion: DeepSearchQA highlights challenges in current agent designs and serves as a diagnostic benchmark to guide development of improved deep-research capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

*Oleg Sedukhin,Andrey Kostin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents improvements in speech recognition evaluation and introduces a string alignment algorithm and a novel Russian speech test dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance speech recognition evaluation, particularly for non-Latin languages, and address fine-tuning biases that may mislead metric improvements.

Method: Develop a string alignment algorithm, collect a labeled Russian speech dataset, relabel existing datasets, and create tools for aligning and evaluating speech recognition models.

Result: Improved word alignment techniques and detailed datasets reveal biases in fine-tuning on specific labeling, enabling advancements in speech evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: The proposed methods and tools enhance speech recognition evaluation reliability and provide resources for further research and industry application, with code availability ensuring broad accessibility.

Abstract: We propose several improvements to the speech recognition evaluation. First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for creating reasoning benchmarks in Urdu and evaluates language models across multiple dimensions, highlighting challenges in reasoning tasks and language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models lack proper evaluation in low-resource languages like Urdu due to insufficient reasoning benchmarks, emphasizing a need for standardized solutions.

Method: The authors use a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation to translate reasoning benchmarks into Urdu and evaluate models on the resulting dataset, UrduBench.

Result: The study reveals significant challenges for models in multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks in Urdu, alongside insights into model performance across datasets, difficulty levels, and language consistency checks.

Conclusion: This research sets a foundation for scalable and standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and highlights the relevance of its methodology for other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to strong reasoning capabilities; however, evaluating such models in low-resource languages remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning. Overall, our work establishes a scalable methodology for standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and provides empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures. This experimental setup is also broadly applicable to other low-resource languages. The code and datasets will be publicly released.

*Amit Meghanani,Thomas Hain*

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation in fine-tuning self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models with speech enhancement (SE) and proposes position-invariant techniques to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of position embeddings exploitation in SSL models when fine-tuning with mean squared error (MSE) loss during integration with speech enhancement tasks.

Method: The study proposes two position-invariant fine-tuning strategies: (1) zero-padding during fine-tuning and (2) a novel approach using speed perturbation combined with soft-DTW loss to reduce positional dependencies.

Result: Experiments revealed that the soft-DTW-based approach achieved faster convergence and better downstream performance, highlighting its effectiveness in SSL-based speech modelling.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need for position-invariant fine-tuning to improve the integration of SSL-based speech models and speech enhancement modules, providing evidence that soft-DTW is a viable method to address this limitation.

Abstract: Integrating front-end speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models is effective for downstream tasks in noisy conditions. SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ChunkWise LoRA, an adaptive method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that accounts for token complexity, achieving significant reductions in latency and memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods use static rank configurations uniformly, disregarding token complexity and computational variation. This limits efficiency and adaptability in fine-tuning large language models.

Method: The method dynamically partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a customized low-rank LoRA configuration. It includes a runtime scheduler for token difficulty estimation and adaptive rank selection, alongside boundary-safe composition and KV-cache integration.

Result: ChunkWise LoRA demonstrated up to 34% lower latency and 38% memory reduction on benchmarks like Wikitext-103 and SQuAD, while maintaining or improving performance metrics such as BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

Conclusion: ChunkWise LoRA is a practical and efficient enhancement to LoRA approaches, improving computational efficiency and memory usage while being compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares two strategies for developing small, multi-task code language models: data mixing and model merging. It explores their effectiveness at various scales and introduces weight analysis to understand task-specific impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient multi-task learning strategies for specialized, small code language models in resource-limited environments.

Method: Fine-tuning two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at different scales (2B and 7B parameters) using data mixing and model merging, followed by evaluation on code generation and summarization tasks using benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue.

Result: Model merging outperformed data mixing at larger scales, achieving high performance on code generation and summarization tasks. Data mixing was more effective at smaller scales. Notable performance improvements were observed in merged models over task-specific fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Carefully designed merging and mixing strategies can integrate task-specific capabilities effectively, offering highly efficient solutions for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Recent research advocates deploying smaller, specialized code LLMs in agentic frameworks alongside frontier models, sparking interest in efficient strategies for multi-task learning that balance performance, constraints, and costs. We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can outperform conventional methods like BISG in inferring ethnicity from names, achieving high accuracy and reduced bias in many diverse contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve existing methods of ethnic classification, which often have limitations like geographic constraints and biases, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models for greater accuracy and broader applicability.

Method: The study uses stratified samples, tests six LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 3 Flash), and applies them to diverse datasets such as US voter files, Indian caste data, and global voter rolls. It compares their performance to BISG and fine-tunes smaller transformer models for cost-effective large-scale deployment.

Result: LLMs achieve higher accuracy (up to 86.7%) than BISG (68.2%) and reduce biases, with strong results across various datasets and countries. In certain cases, enabling reasoning or using metadata improves performance further.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a robust alternative to traditional methods like BISG for ethnic classification, with accurate predictions, reduced biases, and wide-ranging global applicability, including the potential for cost-effective local deployment.

Abstract: I demonstrate that large language models can infer ethnicity from names with accuracy exceeding that of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, enabling inference outside the United States and to contextually appropriate classification categories. Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.

### [72] [EnsembleLink: Accurate Record Linkage Without Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21138)
*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnsembleLink, a record linkage method using pre-trained language models to improve matching accuracy without needing labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current record linkage methods, which either have low accuracy or rely heavily on substantial labeled training data.

Method: EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models to understand semantic relationships, enabling accurate linking of entities across datasets without requiring labeled data. It operates locally on open-source models.

Result: EnsembleLink achieves matching performance comparable to or better than methods requiring heavy labeling in benchmarks on cities, person names, organizations, parties, and bibliographic data.

Conclusion: The proposed method simplifies accurate record linkage while eliminating dependencies on labeled training data or external APIs, making it efficient and accessible for social science research.

Abstract: Record linkage, the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across datasets, is essential to empirical social science but remains methodologically underdeveloped. Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels. EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that "South Ozone Park" is a neighborhood in "New York City" or that "Lutte ouvriere" refers to the Trotskyist "Workers' Struggle" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling. The method runs locally on open-source models, requiring no external API calls, and completes typical linkage tasks in minutes.

### [73] [Output-Space Search: Targeting LLM Generations in a Frozen Encoder-Defined Output Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21169)
*Tobias Materzok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Output-Space Search (OS-Search) transforms LLM output generation into a search task within a defined 3D output space, optimizing processes like parallel sweeps and black-box optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of path-dependent token generation and enable higher diversity and optimization for tasks like storytelling and code generation.

Method: OS-Search selects a target in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space and trains a retrieval-grounded policy using sequence-level RL for outputs aligning near the target, coupled with autoregressive decoding.

Result: The model achieved 3.1 times higher diversity in text generation compared to prompt-chaining and improved optimization on code-related tasks while maintaining code validity.

Conclusion: OS-Search effectively enhances diversity in storytelling and optimizes code generation processes by shifting to output-space-based search.

Abstract: We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

*Xiulin Yang,Heidi Getz,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores conditions for learning hierarchical structure in language focusing on function words' statistical properties across 186 languages, using experiments to identify their role in facilitating neural learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how statistical features of function words influence and support the acquisition of hierarchical structure in language.

Method: Cross-linguistic corpus analysis, counterfactual language modeling, ablation experiments, and probing analyses across 186 studied languages.

Result: Function words with high frequency, structural association, and phrase boundary alignment facilitate language acquisition for neural learners, with frequency and structural association being stronger factors.

Conclusion: The ease of language structure acquisition in neural learners depends on statistical properties of function words, with differences in internal mechanisms and reliance being task-specific.

Abstract: What statistical conditions support learning hierarchical structure from linear input? In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper examines embedding scaling as an alternate method to expert scaling for sparsity in large language models, presenting a new model LongCat-Flash-Lite that surpasses existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling sparsity in large language models traditionally relies on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, but these face diminishing returns. The study aims to explore embedding scaling as an alternative strategy.

Method: The authors conducted experiments and analyses to examine embedding scaling's efficiency compared to MoE. They integrated system optimizations and decoding strategies to leverage sparsity for improved inference speed.

Result: The study introduces LongCat-Flash-Lite, a model with 68.5B parameters and ~3B activated, outperforming equivalent MoE baselines and excelling in agentic and coding domains.

Conclusion: Embedding scaling offers advantages over expert scaling for sparsity in large language models, with system-level optimizations achieving practical speedups. LongCat-Flash-Lite demonstrates viability and competitiveness.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

*Eunjung Yeo,Julie M. Liss,Visar Berisha,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a multilingual framework for assessing speech intelligibility in dysarthric patients, introducing universal and language-specific metrics for cross-language applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing occurrence of neurological disorders leading to dysarthria prompts the need for automated and language-agnostic intelligibility assessment methods.

Method: The proposed framework combines universal phone recognition and language-specific phoneme interpretation, incorporating phonological feature distances and sequence alignment strategies. Three metrics are designed for assessment.

Result: Analysis across four languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Tamil) demonstrated the framework's ability to identify intelligibility degradation patterns consistent with dysarthria clinical observations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively provides cross-language intelligibility assessment, capturing clinically meaningful insights into speech patterns linked to dysarthria.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria motivates the need for automated intelligibility assessment methods that are applicalbe across languages. However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jiatong Li,Gangwei Jiang,Linqi Song,Defu Lian,Ying Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of reasoning hop generalization in large language models, identifying internal error mechanisms and proposing a lightweight correction technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the performance drop in LLMs when faced with reasoning hop challenges that exceed their training distributions.

Method: The authors conduct systematic multi-domain studies, identify internal competition mechanisms causing errors, and propose test-time correction by deactivating erroneous processing heads (ep heads).

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved reasoning hop generalization across tasks and LLMs, validating the proposed correction method's efficacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the role of ep heads in reasoning errors and shows that addressing them can significantly improve model performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has become the standard paradigm for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.

*Christopher Adrian Kusuma,Muhammad Reza Qorib,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of LLMs generating factually incorrect responses due to not knowing their knowledge boundaries, proposing enhanced evaluation methods and a novel approach for improving honesty using pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate when answering questions on topics beyond their knowledge scope, leading to factually incorrect responses. Enhancing their ability to acknowledge knowledge boundaries is crucial for trustworthiness.

Method: The authors propose a robust benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM honesty by leveraging Pythia (an open-source LLM with publicly available pretraining data). They also introduce a novel method utilizing pretraining data to improve LLM honesty.

Result: The improved evaluation benchmark and methodology help LLMs better recognize their knowledge limitations and respond honestly, indicating a reduction in hallucination cases.

Conclusion: This paper advances the honesty of LLMs by providing rigorous evaluation techniques and methods to build honest models using pretraining data, fostering improvement in their reliability and knowledge acknowledgment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable of answering questions, but they are often unaware of their own knowledge boundary, i.e., knowing what they know and what they don't know. As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a federated learning framework, Fed-MedLoRA, tailored for efficient and collaborative adaptation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs for clinical applications poses challenges due to single-institution training data, computational limitations in federated learning with multi-billion-parameter LLMs, and heterogeneity in real-world clinical data, necessitating a robust framework.

Method: The authors propose Fed-MedLoRA, which transmits only low-rank adapter parameters to reduce resource demands. They also introduce an enhanced version, Fed-MedLoRA+, with adaptive aggregation for handling data heterogeneity. The framework was applied to clinical information extraction tasks.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong accuracy in tasks evaluated across five patient cohorts, outperforming traditional BERT models and other LLMs like LLaMA-3, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4o under various testing scenarios.

Conclusion: Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ present scalable and efficient approaches for federated learning in medical LLMs, supporting generalizability and adaptability in heterogeneous clinical environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MGSM-Pro, an extended multilingual math reasoning benchmark, revealing performance drops in low-resource languages due to digit variation and evaluating model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of difficult and recent multilingual benchmarks for mathematical reasoning, along with high variance issues noted in evaluations like GSM-Symbolic, which previously focused only on English.

Method: The authors extend the MGSM dataset using GSM-Symbolic's methodology by introducing five variations of each question with changes in names, digits, and irrelevant context. They test these on nine languages to assess multilingual model robustness.

Result: Many low-resource languages show significant performance drops with digit variations, and proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1 perform less robustly than Claude 4.0 Sonnet. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 perform better in handling variations.

Conclusion: The authors recommend evaluating math reasoning with at least five digit-varying instantiations to ensure fairness and robustness in assessments.

Abstract: Large language models have made substantial progress in mathematical reasoning. However, benchmark development for multilingual evaluation has lagged behind English in both difficulty and recency. Recently, GSM-Symbolic showed a strong evidence of high variance when models are evaluated on different instantiations of the same question; however, the evaluation was conducted only in English. In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 show stronger robustness. Based on these findings, we recommend evaluating each problem using at least five digit-varying instantiations to obtain a more robust and realistic assessment of math reasoning.

### [81] [SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21235)
*Alok Abhishek,Tushar Bandopadhyay,Lisa Erickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHARP, a framework for evaluating the social harm risks of large language models (LLMs) using multidimensional and distribution-aware analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the inadequacy of scalar evaluation methods that fail to accurately represent complex social harm risks, particularly in high-stakes applications of LLMs.

Method: SHARP models social harm as a multivariate random variable, evaluates dimensions of bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability, and uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) to assess worst-case behavior.

Result: Applying SHARP to eleven LLMs, the study found significant variation in risk exposures between models, even with similar average risks, and revealed systematic patterns in dimension-wise harm severity.

Conclusion: Scalar benchmarks obscure critical discrepancies in model behavior. SHARP demonstrates the need for multidimensional and tail-sensitive evaluations to responsibly govern LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented nature of existing research on model collaboration and to consolidate it into a unified field for better understanding and progress.

Method: MoCo is a Python library featuring 26 model collaboration methods and 25 evaluation datasets, aimed at benchmarking and comparing collaboration strategies across different tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that collaboration methods outperform singular LMs in 61.0% of cases, with some methods showing up to 25.8% improvement.

Conclusion: MoCo serves as a foundational toolkit for advancing modular, collaborative AI systems and driving future research in open and decentralized AI models.

Abstract: Advancing beyond single monolithic language models (LMs), recent research increasingly recognizes the importance of model collaboration, where multiple LMs collaborate, compose, and complement each other. Existing research on this topic has mostly been disparate and disconnected, from different research communities, and lacks rigorous comparison. To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalEmbed, a method to create compact and efficient multi-vector embeddings for Visual Document Retrieval, reducing token count by 30-155x while maintaining competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the storage overhead and inefficiency caused by high visual token requirements in multimodal large language models for Visual Document Retrieval.

Method: CausalEmbed utilizes auto-regressive generation and iterative margin loss during contrastive training to learn compact and structured multi-vector embeddings.

Result: The method significantly reduces the token count needed for efficient Visual Document Retrieval by 30-155x, with competitive performances across different benchmarks and backbones.

Conclusion: CausalEmbed offers efficient and scalable multi-vector embedding generation, introducing flexible test-time scaling for multimodal document retrieval.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) through generating high-quality multi-vector embeddings, the substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time. As a result, CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

TL;DR: Qwen3-ASR family introduces advanced all-in-one ASR models and a non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model, showcasing superior performance in ASR tasks across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop high-performing, efficient, and versatile speech recognition models that perform well in real-world scenarios and accelerate research in ASR and audio understanding.

Method: They leveraged large-scale speech training data, integrated audio understanding abilities of Qwen3-Omni, conducted internal and benchmark evaluations, and compared efficiency with existing proprietary and open-source models.

Result: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieved state-of-the-art performance among open-source ASR models and competitiveness with proprietary APIs. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B showed excellent accuracy-efficiency tradeoff with rapid transcription speed, while Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B outperformed leading force alignment models in timestamp accuracy, efficiency, and versatility.

Conclusion: Qwen3-ASR and ForcedAligner models significantly advance ASR and speech alignment technologies, and their open-source release under Apache 2.0 licensing fosters community growth and innovation in audio research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new pretraining method using reinforcement learning to improve safety, factuality, and quality in large language model generations. Significant improvements were shown in various evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety, factuality, and overall quality issues in large language model generations, which persist even after fine-tuning and alignment due to flaws rooted in the pretraining phase.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning-based pretraining approach where documents are streamed, and quality judgments are made using a post-trained model. The method initially uses original and rewritten suffixes for evaluation and gradually rewards high-quality outputs.

Result: The proposed method achieved 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements in factuality and safety compared to standard pretraining, with an 86.3% win rate improvement in overall generation quality.

Conclusion: Embedding reinforcement learning directly into the pretraining phase results in foundational models that exhibit superior safety, factuality, and quality, addressing core behavioral issues from the ground up.

Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper exposes flaws in Large Language Models (LLMs) used for educational assessments, citing their vulnerability to adversarial manipulation through the Compliance Paradox, and introduces tools to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze and address the assumption that LLMs, trained to follow instructions, can objectively evaluate educational submissions without bias or manipulative influence.

Method: The paper introduces the SPACI Framework and AST-ASIP protocol to exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap, performing tests on 9 SOTA models across 25,000 code submissions in various programming languages to measure failure rates.

Result: The research reveals that high-capacity open-weight models demonstrate catastrophic failure rates (>95%) by favoring hidden formatting directives over logical code correctness. It measures this using metrics like Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current LLM alignment strategies create vulnerabilities in automated grading systems. It advocates for domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness over generic RLHF methods and releases its dataset for further research.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Evidence Ranking to optimize the sequence in which evidence is presented for efficient and reliable fact verification, minimizing user effort and improving verification outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing information reliability in NLP-based systems often results in insufficient or overly redundant evidence presentation, causing inefficiencies in fact verification.

Method: Proposes a novel task: Evidence Ranking, comparing one-shot and incremental ranking approaches with an evaluation framework inspired by information retrieval metrics. Builds a benchmark dataset by combining existing fact verification datasets.

Result: Experiments show incremental ranking captures complementary evidence better, and LLMs perform superior compared to baseline, though challenges in sufficiency and redundancy remain.

Conclusion: Evidence Ranking enhances user-focused verification by reducing effort and boosting reliability, laying groundwork for efficient and interpretable verification systems.

Abstract: Attribution and fact verification are critical challenges in natural language processing for assessing information reliability. While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification. This work provides a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

### [88] [Conversation for Non-verifiable Learning: Self-Evolving LLMs through Meta-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21464)
*Yuan Sui,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CoNL, a self-play framework for training large language models in tasks without ground-truth labels, combining generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation. It uses critique-driven improvements to optimize solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models for tasks without verifiable labels is challenging due to lack of ground truth, and traditional evaluator models struggle with inherent biases and low quality evaluations.

Method: The proposed CoNL framework uses structured conversations among multiple agents to propose, critique, and revise solutions. It rewards critiques that improve solutions with diagnostic signals, enabling self-play-driven optimization.

Result: CoNL demonstrated consistent improvements over existing self-rewarding methods across five benchmarks while ensuring stable training performance.

Conclusion: CoNL effectively integrates generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation, showing promise in improving both solution quality and evaluator performance without requiring external judges or ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

### [89] [SOUP: Token-level Single-sample Mix-policy Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21476)
*Lei Yang,Wei Bi,Chenxi Sun,Renren Jin,Deyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOUP introduces a new reinforcement learning framework for language models, allowing integration of off-policy and on-policy learning at the token level, leading to better exploration and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for language models suffer from limited exploration and stability issues due to inefficiencies in mixing on-policy and off-policy data.

Method: The SOUP framework incorporates off-policy data at the prefix of a sequence while keeping the continuation on-policy, using token-level importance ratios to maintain stability and optimize learning.

Result: SOUP demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional on-policy methods and existing off-policy extensions, enhancing exploration and final outcomes.

Conclusion: Token-level mix-policy training in SOUP improves exploration and stability, offering an effective approach for enhancing language model post-training in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods widely used for language model post-training, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity. While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\textbf{O}$licy $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DimStance introduces a new stance detection approach that quantifies attitudes using valence-arousal dimensions across multiple languages and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more nuanced understanding of stance detection by including affective science dimensions (valence and arousal) rather than simplistic categorical labels.

Method: Developing a stance detection dataset called DimStance with valence-arousal annotations across five languages and two domains, and introducing a dimensional stance regression setup. Benchmarking is done by evaluating fine-tuned LLM regressors and other pretrained models.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM regressors perform competitively, but challenges remain, especially for low-resource languages. Token-based generation approaches show limitations.

Conclusion: DimStance enables nuanced, multilingual, emotion-aware stance detection and provides a benchmark for dimensional stance analysis.

Abstract: Stance detection is an established task that classifies an author's attitude toward a specific target into categories such as Favor, Neutral, and Against. Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation. DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware, stance analysis and benchmarking.

### [92] [LMK > CLS: Landmark Pooling for Dense Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21525)
*Meet Doshi,Aashka Trivedi,Vishwajeet Kumar,Parul Awasthy,Yulong Li,Jaydeep Sen,Radu Florian,Sachindra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Landmark (LMK) pooling to overcome weaknesses in current sequence pooling methods, leading to better performance in long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pooling strategies like [CLS] token and mean pooling have limitations such as under-representing distributed evidence or diluting salient signals, especially in long-context tasks.

Method: The authors propose LMK pooling, which partitions sequences into chunks, inserts landmark tokens, and uses mean pooling over these tokens to create the sequence representation.

Result: LMK pooling matches current methods on short-context tasks and significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, demonstrating its scalability.

Conclusion: LMK pooling is a practical, scalable, and effective alternative to existing pooling methods, addressing their weaknesses while improving performance on long-context tasks.

Abstract: Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

*Fanshuang Kong,Richong Zhang,Qiyu Sun,Zhijie Nie,Ting Deng,Chunming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces inversedMixup, a method combining Mixup's controllable augmentation with human-readable outputs through LLM inversion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing augmentation methods either lack interpretability (Mixup) or controllability (LLM-based). The paper aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: InversedMixup aligns task-specific model embeddings with LLM embeddings, enabling controllable text augmentation by reconstructing mixed embeddings into interpretable sentences.

Result: Experiments show improved augmentation performance and address manifold intrusion issues in text Mixup across few-shot and fully supervised tasks.

Conclusion: InversedMixup successfully merges controllability and readability in augmentation, demonstrating strong performance and novel insights into manifold intrusion.

Abstract: Mixup generates augmented samples by linearly interpolating inputs and labels with a controllable ratio. However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

*Yang Zhou,Zhenting Sheng,Mingrui Tan,Yuting Song,Jun Zhou,Yu Heng Kwan,Lian Leng Low,Yang Bai,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, \method{}, which improves clinical history-taking and reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by converting medical notes into structured dialogues and using a comprehensive training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in effective dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic modeling by LLMs, specifically in clinical reasoning requiring iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement.

Method: The \method{} framework converts medical notes into doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided approach and employs a three-stage fine-tuning strategy: supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. It also introduces single-turn reasoning for better interpretability and efficiency.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances clinical reasoning capabilities compared to GPT-4o, with gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach offers a new pathway to improve clinical diagnosis in LLMs by making history-taking more structured, interpretable, and data-efficient. The methodology and datasets are openly available for further research.

Abstract: Effective clinical history taking is a foundational yet underexplored component of clinical reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

TL;DR: ASTRA framework integrates scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning to train robust, tool-using language model agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training language models as tool-using agents for complex decision-making faces challenges like manual intervention, reliance on unverifiable environments, and difficulty in stable multi-turn learning.

Method: ASTRA combines a trajectory synthesis pipeline leveraging tool-call graphs for grounded tool-use competence and an environment synthesis framework converting Q&A traces into executable, rule-verifiable environments for deterministic RL. A unified training methodology integrates SFT and RL with trajectory-level rewards.

Result: ASTRA-trained models outperform existing benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining reasoning abilities comparable to closed-source systems.

Conclusion: ASTRA demonstrates a scalable, automated approach for multi-turn, tool-augmented model training and releases resources to encourage replication and further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.

*Wuyang Zhou,Yuxuan Gu,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KromHC, which utilizes Kronecker products to improve neural network training. It solves issues in previous methods with lower parameter complexity and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for hyper-connections in neural networks face training instability and high parameter complexity. This paper aims to resolve these issues for efficient model training.

Method: The proposed KromHC parametrizes the residual matrices with Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices. It achieves manifold constraints and exact double stochasticity while reducing parameter complexity.

Result: KromHC matches or outperforms existing mHC approaches, ensuring high accuracy with fewer trainable parameters. It achieves $O(n^2C)$ parameter complexity.

Conclusion: KromHC offers a scalable and efficient solution to hyper-connection challenges in neural networks, making it suitable for practical deployment in advanced machine learning tasks.

Abstract: The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\mathcal{O} \left( nC \cdot n! \right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses language models (LMs) to simulate crosslinguistic influence (CLI) in bilingualism, studying factors like language dominance, proficiency, and syntactic distance to isolate and analyze its underlying mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address inconsistencies in human bilingualism studies on CLI by leveraging controlled environments in language models to systematically simulate and understand the phenomenon.

Method: Researchers used language models as controlled statistical frameworks, manipulating L2 exposure timing, language dominance, and syntactic differences to study cross-linguistic priming and CLI effects.

Result: Findings confirm that language dominance and proficiency are key predictors of CLI, and while grammatical structure priming is bidirectional, ungrammatical structure priming depends on language dominance. Moreover, L1 co-activation during L2 processing influences neural mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of language models in simulating and understanding CLI, providing mechanistic evidence and aligning with psycholinguistic findings to offer a computational framework for studying bilingualism.

Abstract: Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a new method for steering discrete diffusion language models using reference sequences during text generation, achieving improved attribute control and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for effective inference-time control mechanisms in discrete diffusion language models, as existing methods for guiding text generation remain limited.

Method: ILRR aligns the internal activations of generated sequences to a specific reference sequence during denoising. It further introduces Spatially Modulated Steering for controlling long texts using short references.

Result: The proposed ILRR method significantly improves attribute steering accuracy, achieving 10% to 60% improvement over baselines with minimal computational cost and maintains high text generation quality.

Conclusion: ILRR is shown to be an effective and computationally efficient tool for inference-time control in diffusion language models, offering flexible steering over semantic attributes while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm to adapt subword tokenizers like BPE for specific domains by replacing inefficient tokens, showing improved results on language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic tokenizers are inefficient for domain-specific or language-specific tasks, causing performance and efficiency challenges in language models.

Method: The authors developed a post-training strategy to adapt tokenizers by replacing low-utility tokens with domain-relevant ones based on an adaptation corpus, optimizing the vocabulary to encode the data effectively.

Result: Experiments show the adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines, demonstrating enhanced performance on tasks across multiple languages.

Conclusion: Adapting tokenizers after training using this method improves efficiency and performance, providing a lightweight vocabulary fine-tuning approach for domain-specific needs.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), significantly impact the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vijini/Adapt-BPE.git.

*Debayan Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses Allan deviation to analyze semantic progression in texts, revealing differences between human texts and outputs from large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the dynamics of semantic progression in written text and compare human-authored text with large language model-generated text.

Method: It treats semantic progression as stochastic trajectories and utilizes Allan deviation to analyze sentence embedding stability as a displacement signal.

Result: Two regimes were identified: short-time scaling to differentiate literature types and long-time stability properties. Large language models mimic local human text but show reduced long-term stability.

Conclusion: Semantic coherence is measurable physically, providing a framework to distinguish human cognition dynamics from algorithmic patterns.

Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \fit, a continual unlearning framework for large language models (LLMs) that tackles the challenges of frequent and high-volume deletion requests, maintaining model performance while effectively unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, copyright, and harmful materials within LLMs while enabling effective unlearning that avoids catastrophic forgetting and degradation in performance during sequential deletion scenarios.

Method: \fit utilizes filtering, importance-aware updates, and targeted layer attribution to handle large-scale deletion requests while preserving model utility. It evaluates through the proposed PCH benchmark with Forget Degree (F.D.) and Retain Utility (R.U.) metrics.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs demonstrate that \fit outperforms existing methods in terms of forgetting effectiveness and utility preservation, while also being resistant to relearning and recovery techniques.

Conclusion: \fit provides a robust solution for continual unlearning in LLMs, maintaining a favorable balance between erasing specific information and retaining overall functionality, and effectively addressing real-world deletion requests.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks but raise concerns about privacy, copyright, and harmful materials. Existing LLM unlearning methods rarely consider the continual and high-volume nature of real-world deletion requests, which can cause utility degradation and catastrophic forgetting as requests accumulate. To address this challenge, we introduce \fit, a framework for continual unlearning that handles large numbers of deletion requests while maintaining robustness against both catastrophic forgetting and post-unlearning recovery. \fit mitigates degradation through rigorous data \underline{F}iltering, \underline{I}mportance-aware updates, and \underline{T}argeted layer attribution, enabling stable performance across long sequences of unlearning operations and achieving a favorable balance between forgetting effectiveness and utility retention. To support realistic evaluation, we present \textbf{PCH}, a benchmark covering \textbf{P}ersonal information, \textbf{C}opyright, and \textbf{H}armful content in sequential deletion scenarios, along with two symmetric metrics, Forget Degree (F.D.) and Retain Utility (R.U.), which jointly assess forgetting quality and utility preservation. Extensive experiments on four open-source LLMs with hundreds of deletion requests show that \fit achieves the strongest trade-off between F.D. and R.U., surpasses existing methods on MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K, and remains resistant against both relearning and quantization recovery attacks.

TL;DR: Recycling Search Experience (RSE) improves Large Language Models' reasoning by storing and using intermediate conclusions and failures during test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in test-time scaling caused by traditional strategies that discard valuable intermediate insights, leading to computational redundancy.

Method: RSE introduces a training-free approach that turns test-time search into a cumulative process by maintaining a shared experience bank, recycling successful insights, and pruning failure patterns.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments on tasks (HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, HLE) show RSE outperforms existing approaches in efficiency with similar computational costs.

Conclusion: RSE enhances scalability and reasoning efficiency by leveraging cumulative search experiences and can achieve state-of-the-art efficiency in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

*Hojae Han,Heeyun Jung,Jongyoon Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient reinforcement learning framework that enables small language models to perform strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints, addressing issues like sparse exploration and unstable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges small language model agents face under limited resource conditions, such as sparse exploration and unstable training, while achieving effective multi-hop reasoning.

Method: The proposed DAVID-GRPO framework stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, assigns retrieval credit using evidence recall, and improves exploration by resampling near-miss trajectories.

Result: DAVID-GRPO outperforms prior reinforcement learning methods in multi-hop QA benchmarks using significantly fewer resources, demonstrating effectiveness with small models on only four GPUs.

Conclusion: Small language models, when equipped with the right inductive biases, can achieve strong reasoning performance with low computational costs using the DAVID-GRPO framework.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.

*Wonduk Seo,Wonseok Choi,Junseo Koh,Juhyeon Lee,Hyunjin An,Minhyeong Yu,Jian Park,Qingshan Zhou,Seunghyun Lee,Yi Bu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OG-MAR, a framework to improve the cultural alignment of large language models by drawing on a global cultural ontology and structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of cultural sensitivity and alignment in large language models due to skewed training data and unstructured representation of values.

Method: OG-MAR uses a cultural ontology created from World Values Survey data, incorporating relations through a fixed taxonomy. At inference, it creates multiple value-persona agents based on demographic similarity and enforces consistency via a judgment agent.

Result: The OG-MAR framework outperforms baselines in cultural alignment, robustness, and offers more interpretable reasoning across benchmarks and various language model backbones.

Conclusion: OG-MAR provides a structured, ontology-driven approach to improve culturally sensitive decision-making in large language models, enhancing their alignment and transparency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

### [105] [Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709)
*Qingyue Yang,Jie Wang,Xing Li,Yinqi Bai,Xialiang Tong,Huiling Zhen,Jianye Hao,Mingxuan Yuan,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA) to explain diverse attention patterns in large language models and applies these insights to accelerate inference via KV cache compression and LLM pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on attention patterns in large language models are fragmented, lacking a unifying explanation and practical application.

Method: The authors developed TAPPA, a framework that categorizes attention patterns into predictable and unpredictable ones based on query self-similarity and conducted mathematical analysis on predictable patterns to derive regularities.

Result: TAPPA insights were successfully validated by applying them to tasks like KV cache compression and LLM pruning, yielding consistent improvements over baseline methods.

Conclusion: TAPPA provides a unifying framework to understand and optimize attention patterns in language models, demonstrating practical benefits for inference acceleration tasks.

Abstract: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

### [106] [TACLer: Tailored Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21711)
*Huiyuan Lai,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TACLer enhances large language model reasoning by optimizing learning efficiency through tailored curriculum reinforcement learning and hybrid reasoning, reducing computational costs and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with long chain reasoning due to inefficiency, redundancy, and high computational costs.

Method: TACLer uses tailored curriculum reinforcement learning, assessing model proficiency to progressively introduce complex knowledge, and a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm to balance efficiency with accuracy.

Result: TACLer reduces training computational costs by over 50%, decreases inference token usage by over 42%, and improves accuracy by 9% compared to base models and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TACLer effectively improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy in large language models while significantly cutting computational resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a parameter-efficient NLP framework addressing issues of greenwashing and vague claims in ESG sustainability reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness and reliability of NLP models when evaluating sustainability reports, which often suffer from issues like greenwashing and generic claims.

Method: The framework uses contrastive learning combined with ordinal ranking objectives to distinguish concrete actions from ambiguous claims. It introduces gated feature modulation to filter noise and MetaGradNorm for optimizing multi-objective tasks.

Result: The framework achieves improved robustness over standard models in cross-category evaluations, highlighting a balance between rigid representation and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the assessment of ESG reports by improving robustness and identifying graded distinctions in claims, addressing limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims. Our approach incorporates gated feature modulation to filter disclosure noise and utilizes MetaGradNorm to stabilize multi-objective optimization. Experiments in cross-category settings demonstrate superior robustness over standard baselines while revealing a trade-off between representational rigidity and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation-driven workflow and Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES) tailored for LLM applications to address the unique challenges of testing stochastic and prompt-sensitive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexities in evaluating LLM applications due to their stochastic and sensitive nature, unlike traditional software outputs.

Method: An evaluation-driven workflow (Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix) and the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES) with tiered evaluation components are presented, alongside discussions on evaluation methods and judge failure modes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate trade-offs in behaviors using a generic improved prompt, highlighting reduced performance in specific tasks but improved instruction-following.

Conclusion: The findings underline the need for tailored prompt iteration and precise claim calibration instead of relying on universal prompt strategies.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

### [109] [Procedural Pretraining: Warming Up Language Models with Abstract Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21725)
*Liangze Jiang,Zachary Shinnick,Anton van den Hengel,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies pretraining language models on structured procedural data instead of web-scale corpora, showing improved algorithmic skills, efficiency, and performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ease the acquisition of rich semantic knowledge in language models by first exposing them to structured abstract data as humans learn foundational knowledge.

Method: Procedural data (e.g., formal languages, algorithms) is used for pretraining. Experiments are conducted to diagnose skills improvements, test larger models, analyze mechanisms, and combine multiple procedural data forms.

Result: Pretraining on procedural data leads to significant gains, reduces data needs, enhances model structure, and outperforms traditional natural language pretraining.

Conclusion: Procedural pretraining offers a lightweight approach to improve language models, accelerating training and highlighting the separation of knowledge acquisition from reasoning.

Abstract: Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method, CE-GOCD, for scientific question answering using LLMs improves retrieval by leveraging semantic substructures in academic knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods for scientific papers lack deep semantic connections, limiting LLMs' comprehension and response quality.

Method: The CE-GOCD approach integrates central entities, subgraph pruning, and community detection to enhance scientific knowledge representation.

Result: CE-GOCD outperforms baseline methods in experiments on three NLP literature question-answering datasets.

Conclusion: CE-GOCD demonstrates the importance of modeling semantic substructures for more effective scientific question answering with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for question answering over scientific research papers. Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

### [111] [Temporal Guidance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21744)
*Hong-Kai Zheng,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Guidance (TeGu), a method to enhance language model generation quality by leveraging Multi-Token Prediction for self-contrast, achieving improvements with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving large language model (LLM) generation quality is essential, but existing methods like Contrastive Decoding require additional computational resources, and techniques reliant on internal contrast like DoLa are unstable for small-scale models.

Method: The proposed Temporal Guidance (TeGu) uses multi-token prediction to create weaker amateur predictions for self-contrast. It includes a Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP) to enable standardized and lightweight implementation.

Result: TeGu demonstrates significant improvements in generation quality across various model series and benchmarks, with low memory and computational overhead.

Conclusion: Temporal Guidance offers a novel approach to enhance LLMs' performance efficiently, making it a practical solution for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm for detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence and human-like text generation capabilities of modern LLMs raise concerns about misinformation and issues like academic integrity, highlighting the need for reliable detection methods.

Method: The authors present a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm, employing an adaptive learning approach for determining the distance between original and rewritten texts. They also provide a geometric analysis to clarify and formalize the theoretical underpinnings of rewrite-based detection.

Result: Experiments conducted across 100+ settings demonstrate superior performance, with the proposed method achieving relative improvements of 57.8% to 80.6% over leading baseline algorithms across various LLMs.

Conclusion: The adaptively learned distance function provides a more effective mechanism for detecting LLM-generated content, offering a reliable solution for addressing the challenges posed by their misuse in misinformation and academic contexts.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop an efficient architectural framework for language generation that requires fewer parameters and can integrate seamlessly into current Transformer-based industrial workflows.

Method: They introduce CoFrGeNets based on continued fractions, which replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer structures. Custom gradient formulations are developed for optimizing these components more effectively.

Result: Experiments with GPT2-xl and Llama3 show competitive, and sometimes superior, downstream task performance with only two-thirds to half as many parameters, along with reduced pre-training times.

Conclusion: The new architecture demonstrates promise as an efficient alternative to traditional Transformers and could further benefit from hardware customization in the future.

Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.

TL;DR: The paper presents Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model offering a trainable end-to-end pipeline from characters to document-level representations, overcoming limitations of fixed tokenizers in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like BPE in LLMs, which hinder adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data and prevent end-to-end optimization.

Method: The authors developed Zonkey, featuring a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) with a Probabilistic Attention mechanism, and a hierarchical model using Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) to compress sequences and ensure stable denoising. The model is trained end-to-end, incorporating a Stitcher for overlap invariance.

Result: Zonkey demonstrated coherent, variable-length text generation from noise, showed emergent linguistic hierarchies, and achieved better alignment with data distributions compared to other learnable tokenizers.

Conclusion: The study proposes a step forward toward fully gradient-based LLMs, offering enhanced adaptability, scalable generation, and a novel differentiable tokenizer. Source code for experiments is provided.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents KID, a framework for detecting harmful memes by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts and employing a dual-head architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of detecting harmful content in internet memes, which often rely on implicit metaphors and background knowledge and evade traditional automated moderation methods.

Method: The authors propose KID, which decomposes meme understanding into reasoning chains linking visual evidence, background knowledge, and labels, using a dual-head system to optimize reasoning and classification simultaneously.

Result: Experiments on five multilingual datasets demonstrate that KID outperforms prior methods by 2.1%-19.7%, achieving state-of-the-art results in harmful meme detection.

Conclusion: KID effectively combines knowledge injection with a dual-head learning architecture, offering a robust and generalizable solution to harmful meme detection and outperforming existing systems significantly.

Abstract: Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

Motivation: Existing lipreading methods struggle with subtle articulation gestures, leading to issues like limited feature discriminability and poor generalization.

Method: The proposed MA-LipNet employs three attention modules: Channel Attention (CA) for channel-wise feature recalibration, Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA) for coarse-grained spatio-temporal filtering, and Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA) for fine-grained refinement.

Conclusion: MA-LipNet underscores the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement in enhancing the robustness of visual speech recognition.

Abstract: Lipreading, the technology of decoding spoken content from silent videos of lip movements, holds significant application value in fields such as public security. However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.

*Haochen Zhang,Animesh Sinha,Felix Juefei-Xu,Haoyu Ma,Kunpeng Li,Zhipeng Fan,Meng Dong,Xiaoliang Dai,Tingbo Hou,Peizhao Zhang,Zecheng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses conversational image generation challenges in non-Markov settings, introducing methods to improve multi-round consistency and compliance with user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the limitations of existing multimodal large language models that largely focus on the latest interaction, omitting long-range history in conversational image generation.

Method: The paper introduces non-Markov data strategies like rollback edits and name-based personalization, token-level caching for history-conditioned training, and improvements in reconstruction for image quality.

Result: The proposed methods improve multi-round consistency, instruction adherence, and personalization while retaining strong single-round performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing non-Markov interactions enhances consistency and usability in conversational image generation, enabling more complex and accurate user interactions.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET images often suffer from noise that affects diagnostic accuracy. Developing a robust approach to enhance their quality is crucial, given various factors influencing the image quality.

Method: The study proposes a text-guided denoising method utilizing features from a pretrained CLIP model and a U-Net based architecture to denoise PET images over varying count levels.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to address low-performance pixels (LPP) in CT detectors using a dual-domain approach and synthetic data, achieving superior artifact correction without real-world clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-performance pixels in CT detectors cause ring and streak artifacts, degrading image quality and clinical usability. Existing solutions require expensive datasets and focus on either image or sinogram domains separately.

Method: An unrolled dual-domain approach is employed, which integrates intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains. Synthetic data created from natural images is used for training, removing the need for real-world datasets.

Result: In simulation experiments, the proposed method demonstrated significantly better performance in correcting LPP artifacts compared to state-of-the-art methods, even with 1-2% detector defects around the isocenter.

Conclusion: The method eliminates the costly process of real-world data collection, improves artifact correction effectively, and is adaptable to various CT scanner settings, making it a feasible software-based solution.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-based model trained on biopsy slides to improve prognostic accuracy in predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after surgery, showing better performance than traditional CAPRA-S methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy are imprecise, necessitating the development of improved methods.

Method: The authors developed and trained an AI-based model utilizing attention-based multiple instance learning and foundation models on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from one cohort and validated it across three external cohorts.

Result: The AI model generalized well across cohorts, achieving 5-year AUC scores of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70 in three external validation sets. Integrating clinical variables further enhanced prognostic value, outperforming guideline-based CAPRA-S.

Conclusion: Histopathology AI models trained on biopsy slides improve preoperative and postoperative decision-making for prostate cancer recurrence prediction but require further validation to ensure their superiority over simpler predictive models.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

TL;DR: BadDet+ enhances backdoor attack mechanisms against object detection systems, achieving robust synthetic-to-physical transfer while maintaining clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current backdoor attack methods for object detection are limited by unrealistic assumptions and lack physical validation.

Method: Introduced BadDet+, a penalty-based framework using log-barrier penalties for robust misclassification and disappearance attacks in object detection.

Result: BadDet+ outperforms existing benchmarks in synthetic-to-physical attack transferability while maintaining clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Object detection systems are vulnerable to advanced backdoor attacks, necessitating development of specialized defensive measures.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [123] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of modality bias in Temporal Action Localization (TAL) by introducing ActionVLM, a framework that minimizes overreliance on language while maximizing visual performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the overemphasis on linguistic priors in TAL, which compromises visual performance and creates modality bias.

Method: The authors propose ActionVLM, implementing a debiasing reweighting module to dynamically adjust the influence of language and a residual aggregation strategy to treat language as a complementary signal.

Result: ActionVLM outperforms state-of-the-art models on the THUMOS14 dataset by up to 3.2% mAP, demonstrating superior effectiveness in TAL.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates modality bias and improves temporal reasoning, emphasizing vision as the dominant signal while effectively utilizing language when advantageous.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a framework improving compositional text-to-image generation by training a multimodal autoregressive model to perform visual chain-of-thought reasoning. SoT achieves enhanced structural integrity and numeracy in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in text-to-image generation, current models struggle with compositional tasks such as numeracy, attribute binding, and structural relations. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose the Shape-of-Thought (SoT) framework, which uses a visual chain-of-thought (CoT) approach. It trains a multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and intermediate visual states, assisted by the SoT-26K dataset, which captures grounded assembly traces.

Result: Fine-tuning on the SoT-26K dataset led to significant improvements: 88.4% component numeracy and 84.8% structural topology accuracy, outperforming baselines by approximately 20%.

Conclusion: SoT sets a new standard for process-supervised compositional generation, establishing an efficient framework for coherent shape assembly and addressing previous limitations in structural and numerical reasoning during text-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-based framework for automated assessment of microanastomosis skills, achieving 97% precision and 96% mAP in instrument detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessments of microsurgical skills are subjective, prone to biases, and lack standardization, highlighting the importance of developing an objective and automated evaluation system.

Method: An AI framework integrates YOLO for instrument detection, DeepSORT for tracking, shape descriptors for tip localization, and a supervised classifier for proficiency evaluation based on expert-labeled data.

Result: The framework demonstrates a high instrument detection precision of 97% and achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96% across a range of IoU thresholds (50%-95%).

Conclusion: The proposed AI system addresses shortcomings in manual microsurgical skill assessment, offering an effective, objective, and scalable alternative for consistent evaluation of instrument handling proficiency.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDCI, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images, achieving superior performance through improved feature encoding, segmentation reliability, and boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of current open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods for high-resolution remote sensing images, which fail to meet requirements in geometric localization and semantic prediction due to simplistic fusion and post-processing strategies.

Method: The SDCI framework includes a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module for collaborative feature encoding, a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module for segmentation reliability improvement, and a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to refine object boundaries.

Result: Experiments validated SDCI's superior performance on various remote sensing benchmarks and demonstrated its effectiveness in improving both semantic segmentation and boundary refinement compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SDCI improves open-vocabulary semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery by leveraging innovative modules like CAF, BCDR, and CSCP, while also confirming the enduring utility of traditional superpixel-based methods within deep learning.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Result: Experiments show GeoDiff-LF achieves superior visual fidelity and performance compared to existing methods, establishing new standards in underwater image enhancement.

Conclusion: GeoDiff-LF demonstrates how integrating diffusion priors with LF geometry successfully achieves state-of-the-art underwater imaging quality, and its code will be publicly available for further research.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called FRISM to enhance reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without compromising visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that integrate reasoning capabilities into VLMs operate at a coarse-grained level, leading to a trade-off between reasoning and visual abilities.

Method: FRISM introduces a fine-grained reasoning injection framework utilizing subspace-level decomposition via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptive tuning of subspace scaling coefficients. It also employs a self-distillation learning strategy leveraging vision-language datasets.

Result: FRISM consistently outperforms existing methods in enhancing reasoning while maintaining the original visual performance of models.

Conclusion: FRISM proves to be an effective approach for injecting reasoning capabilities into VLMs, offering robust performance on visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving visual understanding.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), a text-to-video retrieval method combining generative retrieval with dense reranking for high efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video Retrieval is essential for video platforms, but dense retrieval struggles with scalability. Efficient two-stage approaches need improvement in recall model performance to ensure better candidate selection for reranking.

Method: GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to videos using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer and jointly trains the tokenizer and retriever to improve semantic alignment between videos and text queries.

Result: GRDR achieves comparable accuracy to dense retrieval models while drastically reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and improving retrieval speed by up to 300 times.

Conclusion: GRDR provides a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale Text-to-Video Retrieval, balancing accuracy and resource efficiency through its novel generative approach.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

Conclusion: Thinker effectively improves robotic perception and reasoning by addressing known challenges with innovative methods and data inputs.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs and overcome impractical assumptions of existing single-image attacks in real-world settings.

Method: The LAMP method applies attention-based constraints, cross-image contagious constraints, and an index-attention suppression loss for position-invariant, effective adversarial attacks.

Result: LAMP demonstrates superior attack success rates, surpassing SOTA baselines across various vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: LAMP effectively highlights the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs, offering a strong tool for evaluating and understanding these advanced models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Method: PTQ4ARVG framework involves Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) for channel-wise activation, Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) for token variance, and Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) for sample distribution mismatch.

Result: PTQ4ARVG quantized ARVG models to 8-bit and 6-bit, achieving competitive performance validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG addresses quantization challenges in ARVG models and effectively improves computational efficiency while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

*Zhen Wang,Hongyi Liu,Jianing Li,Zhihui Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS) to enhance fidelity and perception in Plug-and-Play (PnP) diffusion methods by modulating noise frequency during sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the balance between perceptual quality and data fidelity in image restoration methods that struggle due to noise introduced in reverse diffusion.

Method: They designed a Fourier-domain filter to progressively suppress low-frequency noise and preserve high-frequency components during reverse diffusion, injecting data consistency without additional training.

Result: NFCDS achieves faster convergence and improves fidelity and perception in diffusion-based restoration frameworks for diverse zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: NFCDS successfully enhances fidelity-perception balance and can seamlessly integrate into existing diffusion-based restoration systems.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

TL;DR: Hypersolid introduces a method to prevent representation collapse by applying hard-ball repulsion for maintaining injectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the challenge of avoiding representation collapse in self-supervised learning, aiming to preserve information through better representation techniques.

Method: The method involves using a short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions and reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem.

Result: Hypersolid achieves high separation in representation space, maintaining augmentation diversity and performing well on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective alternative to global regularization approaches, excelling in preserving diversity and improving classification outcomes in specific settings.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a high-fidelity 3D talking face compression framework suitable for low-bitrate real-time 3D video conferencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D video conferencing solutions struggle with high-fidelity representation within low bitrates due to limitations in 2D compression techniques and computational expense of methods like NeRF.

Method: The framework uses FLAME-based parametric modeling integrated with 3D Gaussian-based neural rendering (3DGS), transmitting essential facial metadata only and employing Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization for efficient reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show superior rate-distortion performance with high-quality 3D facial rendering at low bitrates.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a lightweight, efficient solution for achieving realistic 3D talking faces, facilitating real-time applications in video conferencing.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) predict photograph geolocation well but fail at explaining their reasoning effectively. A new benchmark evaluates their reasoning abilities in the context of the GeoGuessr game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of VLMs to explain their geolocation predictions and bridge the gap between their prediction accuracy and reasoning transparency.

Method: Introduced a novel benchmark focusing on geolocation reasoning from the GeoGuessr game. Collaborated with expert players to produce 800 ground-truth reasoning chains for comparison with VLM outputs.

Result: Closed-source VLMs perform nearly as well as expert humans in geolocation but poorly in reasoning explanations. Open-weight VLMs perform much worse, highlighting a significant gap in understanding fine-grained visual evidence.

Conclusion: VLMs, while impressive at geolocation prediction, lack the ability to produce robust, auditable reasoning chains. This underscores the need to address their fine-grained visual attribute extraction capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

TL;DR: Manual tower inspections for antenna affiliation identification are replaced with a multi-modal classification and matching framework that combines video data, geometric features, and PCI signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tower inspections for antenna affiliation are challenging and error-prone, motivating the need for automated, robust identification methods.

Method: A new training framework is introduced, aligning antenna images with PCI signals, and employs Token Entropy Regularization during pretraining to address cross-modal representation challenges.

Result: Token Entropy Regularization was shown to accelerate convergence and significantly boost performance.

Conclusion: A novel approach improves antenna affiliation identification, paving the way for better communication network optimization; code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldBench, a benchmark for evaluating generative foundational models on their ability to understand and simulate specific physical concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks, which entangle multiple physical laws in a single test, thereby preventing precise evaluation of a model's understanding of specific physical concepts.

Method: The authors create a video-based benchmark called WorldBench, designed for disentangled evaluation of physical concepts, focusing separately on intuitive physical understanding and low-level physical constants.

Result: State-of-the-art world models tested on WorldBench demonstrated significant shortcomings in understanding and replicating specific physical concepts, revealing a lack of physical consistency.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a novel and scalable solution for evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of world models, offering insights to improve their reliability and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a hybrid framework combining deep learning and graphical models for depth completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle to handle the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data, limiting performance under high sparsity.

Method: The GBPN framework integrates deep learning with probabilistic graphical models. It dynamically constructs a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) with a Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) and infers dense depth using Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), incorporating adaptive non-local edges and an improved message passing scheme.

Result: GBPN achieves state-of-the-art results on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, robustness, and generalizability across various sparsity conditions.

Conclusion: By leveraging both learned and probabilistic inference methods, GBPN effectively handles sparse inputs and long-range spatial dependencies, enhancing depth completion under various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mam-App is a lightweight deep learning model for crop disease classification, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameters, suitable for deployment on low-resource devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global agricultural demand and reduce food loss from crop diseases, focusing on efficient identification and classification of apple leaf diseases using deep learning.

Method: Development of a parameter-efficient Mamba-based deep learning model (Mam-App) for leaf disease classification across different datasets.

Result: Mam-App achieves high classification performance across multiple datasets (99.58% accuracy for apple, 99.48% accuracy for corn, and 98.46% accuracy for potato) using only 0.051M parameters.

Conclusion: Mam-App successfully balances high performance and efficiency, positioning it as an effective tool for resource-constrained platforms to combat crop diseases.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LANE, an improved method for 3D mesh generation, addressing speed and scalability limitations of existing techniques, while enhancing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive methods for 3D mesh generation struggle with slow inference and limited sequence scalability, restricting structural detail.

Method: The authors introduce LANE with compact autoregressive dependencies and the AdaGraph strategy to enhance efficiency and scalability in 3D mesh generation.

Result: LANE achieves a 6× improvement in maximum sequence length, faster inference, and superior 3D mesh quality in terms of structural detail and geometric consistency.

Conclusion: LANE provides an effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation, overcoming the limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overconfident predictions in DNNs on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs using a framework based on optimal transport (OT) geometry and introduces a method leveraging OT-induced singular boundaries to suppress overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the overconfidence of deep neural networks (DNNs) when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, which compromises their reliability in open-world settings.

Method: The authors propose using semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) to identify singular boundaries in high-dimensional space, where classifiers are likely to fail. They introduce OT-induced OOD samples (OTIS) and a confidence suppression loss during training to guide DNNs towards better-calibrated predictions.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant reduction in overconfidence on OOD inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating the optimal transport framework into training allows DNNs to reduce unwarranted confidence in semantically ambiguous regions, thereby improving their reliability in OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Pritika Vig,Ren-Chin Wu,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores whether vision foundation models can encode continuous disease progression from static images and finds they can capture coherent progression directions relevant to computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the question of whether vision foundation models can encode continuous processes underlying their training data, particularly for tasks related to computational pathology.

Method: The study employs diffusion pseudotime, a method used to infer developmental trajectories, to evaluate if disease states are ordered along meaningful progression directions in the representation space of vision foundation models.

Result: Pathology-specific models across four cancer progressions exhibit high trajectory fidelities, with vision-only models ranking highest. Trajectory fidelity strongly predicts classification accuracy on unseen diseases and aligns with known stromal remodeling patterns.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can learn continuous processes from discrete images, making trajectory fidelity a complementary metric for assessing representation quality. The approach has broad potential applications in domains beyond pathology where continuous phenomena are observed as static snapshots.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Motivation: HSI-SR methods focus on enhancing spatial resolution but often result in spectral inconsistencies and physically implausible artifacts.

Method: Proposes SR$^{2}$-Net, a plug-and-play rectifier with H-S$^{3}$A for cross-band interactions and MCR for ensuring a compact spectral manifold. Also introduces degradation-consistency loss for data fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks and model backbones show improved spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: SR$^{2}$-Net enhances spectral fidelity and quality for HSI-SR, working flexibly with diverse models and benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to address challenges in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) by constructing a robust global adapter for efficient and effective learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in Class-Incremental Learning, such as destructive interference, catastrophic forgetting, high retrieval costs, and inadequate knowledge transfer caused by task-specific adapters.

Method: The authors propose DAF, rooted in PAC-Bayes theorem. It integrates optimized task-specific adapter parameters, previous global parameters, and initialization parameters, achieving stability and plasticity through dynamically derived optimal fusion coefficients. A Robust Initialization strategy further enhances global knowledge capture.

Result: Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks show DAF achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving over previous methods.

Conclusion: DAF successfully addresses core challenges in CIL by effectively fusing task parameters into a robust global adapter, optimizing knowledge transfer and retention while setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) faces challenges of retaining old knowledge while learning new classes. SGDS, through activation space sparsification, outperforms current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inter-task interference and loss of plasticity in Class-Incremental Learning, which commonly uses constrained parameter methods that limit adaptability.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) that dynamically assigns sparse activation subspaces, enabling knowledge transfer for similar classes while avoiding interference for dissimilar classes.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that SGDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in CIL.

Conclusion: SGDS effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability in CIL by mitigating interference without heavily constraining parameters through activation subspace sparsification.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Method: HMRMamba employs a Geometry-Aware Lifting Module with a dual-scan Mamba architecture for robust 2D-to-3D pose lifting using geometric cues. It also introduces a Motion-guided Reconstruction Network to process kinematic patterns over time, enhancing temporal coherence.

Result: HMRMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M. It surpasses existing methods in accuracy, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HMRMamba addresses key limitations in traditional HMR architectures by improving spatiotemporal dynamics modeling and geometric grounding, offering a more accurate, robust, and efficient approach for video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery.

Abstract: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

### [148] [Rectifying Geometry-Induced Similarity Distortions for Real-World Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21405)
*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) by addressing the challenges of extreme camera geometric distortions using a novel technique called Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras that cause severe geometric distortions and degrade the reliability of attention-based similarity mechanisms in AG-ReID.

Method: The paper proposes the GIQT module, which explicitly rectifies query-key similarity distortions induced by camera geometry, and introduces a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism for adaptive representation priors.

Result: Experiments on four AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the system's robustness to extreme geometric conditions while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: GIQT effectively addresses the geometric distortions in AG-ReID and enhances performance, providing a robust and computationally efficient solution for cross-view person re-identification challenges.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Zihan Su,Hongyang Wei,Kangrui Cen,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Chun Yuan,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMRG, a method enhancing multimodal models by creating intrinsic visual representations, improving both understanding and generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in leveraging generation to improve multimodal models' understanding capabilities, while using understanding to enhance generation has been explored.

Method: UniMRG employs auxiliary generation tasks to generate intrinsic visual representations (pixel, depth, segmentation), enhancing visual understanding within multimodal models.

Result: UniMRG improves fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, enhances spatial understanding, and boosts generation capabilities across diverse multimodal architectures.

Conclusion: The incorporation of generation tasks for intrinsic visual representations into UMMs leads to a more comprehensive visual understanding and improved generation performance.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

*Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Yue Zhou,Jiaming Zhong,Wei Ye,Wenhui Yi,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Haodong Li,Bo Cao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-path framework to expose AI-generated videos using structured pixel patterns and manifold deviation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As the quality of synthetic video content improves, distinguishing AI-generated videos from real ones becomes challenging. This paper addresses the need for advanced detection methods.

Method: A hierarchical dual-path framework is proposed. One branch detects spatial anomalies using Vision Foundation Models while the other detects temporal fluctuations in pixel patterns.

Result: The framework successfully identifies deviations in AI-generated videos, regardless of their visual quality or adherence to real-world manifolds.

Conclusion: Manifold Projection Fluctuations and hierarchical detection prove effective in differentiating fake videos from real ones, ensuring robust detection despite high visual fidelity.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [151] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper highlights the limitations of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) under heavy occlusion, identifying issues in implicit density fields termed Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). An explicit geometric pipeline using Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) is proposed to improve recovery rates and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand the reliability of NeRFs for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes.

Method: The authors conducted controlled experiments to study IGD in NeRFs and proposed an explicit pipeline using Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) and SfM feature geometry.

Result: The explicit geometric pipeline achieved a 95.8% instance recovery rate, outperforming mask-supervised NeRFs which saturated at approximately 89%. Explicit SfM-based geometry was found more robust, recovering 43% more instances under degraded segmentation masks.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors are essential for reliable 3D quantitative analysis in self-occluding scenes, especially overcoming limitations of NeRFs in dense environments.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

### [152] [MultiModal Fine-tuning with Synthetic Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21426)
*Shohei Enomoto,Shin'ya Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning in deep neural networks. It enhances unimodal datasets with synthetic captions using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), introduces a supervised contrastive loss, and improves image classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training methods have evolved to multimodal learning, improving visual understanding. However, fine-tuning often remains unimodal, failing to make full use of the benefits of multimodal pre-trained representations.

Method: The authors propose generating synthetic image captions for unimodal datasets using MLLMs, leveraging tailored prompts with class labels and domain context. They introduce a supervised contrastive loss to cluster representations and an inference technique using class-averaged text embeddings.

Result: The method was tested on 13 image classification benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning gap, establishing a new paradigm for dataset enhancement in image classification. The code is publicly available for further application and research.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spava, a sequence-parallel framework, to efficiently handle long-video inference by distributing computation across GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in long-video inference due to the resource-intensive prefill stage in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

Method: Spava employs optimized attention and sequence-parallel execution across multiple GPUs to reduce computation and enhance parallelism. System optimizations like load balancing and fused forward passes improve overall performance.

Result: Spava achieves significant speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, respectively, without degrading performance.

Conclusion: Spava enables efficient long-video inference by effectively handling visual embeddings across GPUs, providing a scalable and high-performance solution for LMMs.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

*Donghuo Zeng,Hao Niu,Zhi Li,Masato Taya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic framework to analyze embedding geometry and optimization dynamics across seven losses in image retrieval, revealing a trade-off between diversity preservation and embedding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to understand the effects of metric learning losses on embedding geometry, given the lack of insight into optimization dynamics in image retrieval tasks.

Method: The authors develop a diagnostic framework using VARIANCE and GREEDINESS metrics to assess various loss functions across five datasets, analyzing their effects on optimization and embedding structures.

Result: The analysis shows differences among losses: Triplet and SCL preserve higher variance and clear inter-class margins, while Contrastive and InfoNCE lead to faster compact embeddings. N-pair achieves large separation but with uneven spacing.

Conclusion: Triplet and SCL are recommended for preserving diversity and addressing hard samples; Contrastive and InfoNCE are suited for faster compaction. A trade-off exists between efficiency and granularity in metric learning.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

*Midou Guo,Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Rui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RT-DeepLoc, a framework for localizing temporal deepfake forgeries using reconstruction errors and weak supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-grained temporal localization of deepfake manipulations without relying on costly frame-level annotations.

Method: RT-DeepLoc leverages a Masked Autoencoder trained on authentic data to identify reconstruction discrepancies in forged video segments. It also employs a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss to enhance discrimination while maintaining generalization.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets like LAV-DF show RT-DeepLoc outperforms existing methods in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc establishes a robust approach for detecting fine-grained temporal forgeries, achieving state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised settings.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Result: LingBot-VA demonstrates long-horizon manipulation capabilities, improved data efficiency, and strong generalizability in both simulated and real-world tasks. The code and model are also publicly shared.

Conclusion: The LingBot-VA framework effectively combines video world modeling and vision-language pretraining, advancing robot learning and showcasing its efficiency and adaptability in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

Motivation: To estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications, as this decision depends on individual patient data and requires adaptive approaches.

Method: The study employs a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) framework and proposes HyperAdAgFormer, a transformer-based model with hypernetworks for adaptive feature aggregation using tabular data.

Result: Experiments with clinical data show the proposed model is effective in determining the need for device usage in managing calcifications.

Conclusion: HyperAdAgFormer aids physicians in making more informed decisions regarding coronary artery calcification treatment while incorporating individual patient data. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempt to estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications from computed tomography (CT) images. We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve inefficiencies and lack of semantic consistency in treating image generation and editing separately while enabling structured control over object relationships.

Method: SimGraph combines token-based generation and diffusion-based editing under a unified scene graph-driven framework.

Result: SimGraph shows empirical superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and coherence.

Conclusion: Integrated scene graph-driven frameworks like SimGraph enhance the efficiency, control, and quality of image generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models enhance synthesis of vehicle damage images, creating challenges in fraud prevention and claim reliability. The proposed HERS framework boosts fidelity and domain alignment by employing expert adaptation without manual annotations, and is effective across diverse diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the misuse risks of synthetic vehicle damage imagery in insurance workflows and aims to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of text-to-image diffusion models in high-stakes domains.

Method: HERS framework relies on domain-specific expert fine-tuning of a diffusion model using self-supervised image-text pairs generated by a combination of large language models and T2I pipelines. It models each damage category separately and unifies them into a multi-damage model.

Result: HERS improves text faithfulness by 5.5% and human preference ratings by 2.3% compared to baseline models while ensuring effective synthesis of vehicle damage without manual annotation.

Conclusion: HERS addresses the risks posed by synthetic vehicle damage imagery, ensuring safer and controlled generative model applications in auto insurance workflows, while balancing fidelity and fraud detection considerations.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone for vision tasks, inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving competitive results with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and the difficulty in interpreting attention weights limit their scalability and clarity. This motivates alternatives for efficient token mixing in vision tasks.

Method: The paper proposes Vision KAN (ViK) with a token mixer combining Radial Basis Function-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), axis-wise separable mixing, and low-rank global mapping to ensure efficient local and global feature interactions.

Result: ViK achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet-1K with linear complexity, providing an efficient alternative to attention-based mechanisms.

Conclusion: KAN-based token mixing provides a scalable and effective alternative to attention mechanisms, addressing issues of complexity and interpretability while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

*Hongxu Chen,Hongxiang Li,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver) to overcome the latency in Flow Matching models by combining a SideNet and a backbone network for efficient synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models face significant latency due to iterative ODE solving, and existing solutions either degrade performance at low NFEs or incur high learning costs. There is a need for a method that balances efficiency, performance, and low cost.

Method: The BA-solver introduces a lightweight SideNet to work along the frozen main backbone, employing bidirectional temporal perception and bi-anchor velocity integration to approximate velocities and reduce integration errors, allowing usage of larger intervals in ODE solving.

Result: BA-solver achieves high-quality generation comparable to 100+ NFEs with only 10 NFEs and maintains performance at 5 NFEs. It also has negligible training costs and supports existing generative pipelines for tasks like image editing.

Conclusion: The BA-solver effectively addresses the inefficiencies in Flow Matching models by reducing the NFEs while maintaining fidelity and minimizing training costs, offering a versatile and efficient plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs.

*Luwei Tu,Jiawei Wu,Xing Luo,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses All-in-One Image Restoration issues using an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM) to optimize across diverse image degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods that struggle with coarse-grained controls and fixed mappings for diverse degradations in image restoration tasks.

Method: A novel UDBM is proposed, reformulating the problem using a relaxed diffusion bridge to handle pixel-wise uncertainty and to resolve drift singularity issues. Dual modulation strategies for noise and path schedules refine transport geometry and dynamics.

Result: UDBM achieves state-of-the-art results across various restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Conclusion: This method improves the adaptation of restoration frameworks, addressing conflicting objectives and enabling more effective and efficient image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Conclusion: HydroSense establishes a new standard for cost-effective and accessible water quality monitoring, combining intelligent system architecture with affordable technology.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database. This research establishes a new paradigm for accessible environmental monitoring, demonstrating that professional-grade water quality assessment can be achieved through intelligent system architecture and cost-effective component selection.

### [164] [WMVLM: Evaluating Diffusion Model Image Watermarking via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21610)
*Zijin Yang,Yu Sun,Kejiang Chen,Jiawei Zhao,Jun Jiang,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WMVLM, a new unified and interpretable framework for watermark evaluation in diffusion model images, addressing flaws in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermark evaluation methods for diffusion model images are limited by lack of unified frameworks, poor interpretability, inadequate security considerations, and improper metrics for semantic watermarks.

Method: A novel evaluation framework, WMVLM, uses vision-language models (VLMs) to assess residual and semantic watermarks with newly defined metrics and a three-stage training strategy enabling classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation.

Result: WMVLM achieves better performance and generalization than state-of-the-art VLMs across various datasets, models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: WMVLM provides a robust, interpretable, and unified solution for evaluating digital watermarks in diffusion model images, addressing critical shortcomings of existing techniques.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

*Songhan Jiang,Fengchun Liu,Ziyue Wang,Linghan Cai,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PathReasoner, a dataset and model designed to enhance transparent clinical reasoning in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack verifiable reasoning, limiting trust and error correction in clinical applications.

Method: The authors created PathReasoner, a database with >20K samples generated via a knowledge-guided pipeline using medical knowledge graphs. They also designed PathReasoner-R1 utilizing fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning with structured rewards.

Result: PathReasoner-R1 achieved state-of-the-art performance on both its dataset and public benchmarks, improving logical consistency and robustness.

Conclusion: PathReasoner enables pathology models to provide clinically grounded reasoning, boosting trust and transparency in computational pathology.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

### [166] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates how vision models develop similar representations and compares processes across different models, such as CNN and transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if vision models not only converge to similar representations but also share intermediate steps and processes during training.

Method: Quantitative distance measurements were used to examine model representations across different stages, analyzing and comparing CNNs and transformers.

Result: While similarly-positioned layers in different models produce comparable representations, significant differences remain, such as classifiers discarding low-level information and transformers applying smoother changes.

Conclusion: The findings highlight distinctions in processing among vision models and provide insights into their convergence behaviors and intermediate operations.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

### [167] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fault-Adaptive Routing in Eisenstein-Jacobi Interconnection Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21090)
*Mohammad Walid Charrwi,Zaid Hussain*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve routing in Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) network architectures experiencing faults, surpassing traditional methods like Dijkstra and greedy routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising density in many-core architectures demands interconnection networks that combine high performance with fault tolerance, but traditional routing strategies struggle amid failures.

Method: Three routing methods—Greedy, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and RL—were analyzed on EJ network architecture under fault conditions. The RL approach used multi-objective rewards to enhance path efficiency and avoid faults.

Result: In a nine-fault scenario, greedy routing faltered with only 10% effectiveness, while RL achieved 94% reachability and 91% packet delivery, even exceeding Dijkstra's under congestion.

Conclusion: RL-based routing provides a robust, efficient, and decentralized solution, balancing fault tolerance with excellent throughput, outperforming both greedy and Dijkstra's methods in challenging conditions.

Abstract: The increasing density of many-core architectures necessitates interconnection networks that are both high-performance and fault-resilient. Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.

*Francesco Paladino,Shulu Li,Edward A. Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a coordination mechanism called maxwait for distributed time-sensitive systems, enabling explicit balance of timing and consistency with flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of balancing timing requirements and consistency in distributed systems under communication delays and synchronization uncertainty.

Method: Introduces maxwait, a flexible coordination mechanism to ensure logical-time consistency and structured fault handling, implemented in Lingua Franca.

Result: Maxwait generalizes widely used distributed system methods and patterns while offering enhanced timing control and determinism.

Conclusion: The maxwait mechanism provides a unified framework for improving timing, fault detection, and determinism in distributed systems.

Abstract: Distributed time-sensitive systems must balance timing requirements (availability) and consistency in the presence of communication delays and synchronization uncertainty. This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.

TL;DR: ZipMoE is a novel serving system designed for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that enables efficient, lossless deployment on edge devices by addressing memory constraints and enhancing workflow parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive memory requirements which impede deploying MoE architectures on resource-constrained edge devices without relying on lossy quantization.

Method: ZipMoE introduces a caching-scheduling co-design exploiting hardware properties and statistical redundancy in MoE parameters to shift inference from I/O-bound bottlenecks to compute-centric workflows.

Result: ZipMoE leads to significant improvements, achieving up to 72.77% reduction in inference latency and a 6.76x increase in throughput compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: ZipMoE demonstrates effectiveness in optimizing MoE inference on edge devices, providing substantial performance improvements, making it feasible for practical deployment while preserving model behavior.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

*Adithya Bhat,Harshal Bhadreshkumar Shah,Mohsen Minaei*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ira, a framework designed to improve backup replay in primary-backup replication using compact hints for transaction batches. The approach improves replay efficiency significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Primary-backup replication suffers latency due to backup nodes replaying transactions. This paper aims to reduce this latency by leveraging information available during primary execution.

Method: The proposed Ira framework transmits compact hints during transaction batch processing. A protocol, Ira-L, is introduced for optimized cache management in Ethereum, utilizing metadata and working set details provided by the primary.

Result: Evaluations on Ethereum mainnet activity show substantial improvements with Ira-L. Median replay time speedup is 25x, with aggregate replay reduced from 6.5 hours to 16 minutes for 16-threaded prefetching. The hints impose a modest computational load on the primary.

Conclusion: Ira notably accelerates backup replay processes, reducing latency and proving its scalability for production environments. This method is effective and efficient, especially with parallelization.

Abstract: In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.
  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.
  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

*Bronislav Sidik,Chaya Levi,Joseph Kampeas*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes EWSJF, an adaptive scheduler for serving large language models, significantly improving throughput and reducing latency for short queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in standard First-Come, First-Served scheduling for mixed workloads, which suffer from high latency and underutilized hardware.

Method: EWSJF method includes unsupervised partitioning, dynamic queue routing, context-aware prioritization, and Bayesian meta-optimization.

Result: EWSJF achieves over 30% improvement in throughput and up to 4x reduction in latency for short queries compared to standard FCFS.

Conclusion: The study concludes that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling like EWSJF is essential for efficient and responsive deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SA-PSKY, a dynamic framework for Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing in edge-cloud systems, outperforming traditional static methods by reducing communication overhead and response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of sensor data in edge computing environments demands more efficient PSKY processing methods that can adapt to variability, overcoming challenges like communication bottlenecks and computational latency.

Method: The paper formalizes the threshold adjustment problem for PSKY processing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent in a self-adaptive framework to optimize filtering intensities based on system states.

Result: Experimental evaluations show SA-PSKY achieves up to 60% reduction in communication overhead and 40% reduction in response time compared to traditional methods, with robust scalability across different data distributions.

Conclusion: SA-PSKY addresses resource conflicts in edge computing with a self-adaptive PSKY processing framework, demonstrating significant improvements in resource efficiency and adaptability over static and heuristic approaches.

Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

TL;DR: The paper explores Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), demonstrating how it performs well even in non-Gaussian factor graphs, supported by theoretical guarantees using the Central Limit Theorem and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of Gaussian approximations in non-Gaussian, sparsely connected factor graphs under Belief Propagation, addressing its widespread use despite non-Gaussian modeling.

Method: The paper leverages the Central Limit Theorem and introduces 4 key assumptions to prove mathematically that variable beliefs converge to Gaussian distributions in loopy factor graphs. Experiments validate this convergence in a stereo depth estimation task.

Result: Gaussian-like variable beliefs emerge after a few iterations of Belief Propagation in complex, sparsely-connected factor graphs, confirmed by experimental evaluation.

Conclusion: Gaussian approximations are theoretically and experimentally valid for sparsely-connected factor graphs in spatial AI applications, supporting GBP efficiency in practical tasks.

Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of navigating exponentially large design spaces for circuit topologies, which has been traditionally performed by human experts or limited AI approaches.

Method: The framework employs automated analytical evaluation to assess converter functionality and theoretical performance without simulations, combined with evolutionary finetuning where a generative model evolves through fitness and uniqueness-based selection.

Result: PowerGenie discovers an innovative 8-mode reconfigurable converter achieving a 23% higher FoM than the best topology in training, with efficiency improvements confirmed through SPICE simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior validity, novelty, and efficiency in discovering reconfigurable power converter topologies compared to prior approaches, showcasing scalable automated design potential for performance-oriented applications.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing LLM-driven heuristic design frameworks, such as endpoint-only evaluation and costly adaptation to new problem distributions.

Method: Developed DASH, which uses convergence-aware metrics for solver optimization and introduces Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) to reduce warm-start costs.

Result: DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3x and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in solution quality. It reduces adaptation costs by over 90% while maintaining accuracy on diverse distributions.

Conclusion: DASH provides an efficient and adaptable approach to combinatorial optimization, achieving superior performance and reduced costs in LLM-driven heuristic design frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

*Atik Faysal,Mohammad Rostami,Reihaneh Gh. Roshan,Nikhil Muralidhar,Huaxia Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a method that optimizes multimodal pretraining for a designated target modality to enhance downstream fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal pretraining yields general-purpose representations, current methods often fall short in optimizing the primary target modality heavily relied upon in downstream tasks.

Method: FIP involves augmenting masked modeling through increased masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and expanded decoder capacity for a target modality—without altering the shared encoder or using additional data.

Result: FIP enhances downstream fine-tuning performance of the target modality, demonstrated on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, all without requiring extra data or compute resources.

Conclusion: FIP is a simple, model-agnostic, and effective approach to adapt multimodal representation learning pipelines for better performance on fine-tuning tasks involving specific modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

*Xiyuan Liu,Christian Hacker,Shengnian Wang,Yuhua Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework blending causal discovery with generative ML to create new metal hydride candidates for enhanced hydrogen storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited database of well-characterized hydrides restricts the discovery of ideal hydrogen storage materials.

Method: Implemented causal discovery with a lightweight generative ML model to produce and rank novel hydride candidates using a dataset of 450 samples.

Result: Generated 1,000 candidates and identified six unreported metal hydride formulas and structures, validating four through density functional theory simulations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and efficient method for broadening hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

*Jiangyang Li,Chenhao Ding,Songlin Dong,Qiang Wang,Jianchao Zhao,Yuhang He,Yihong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a prompt-sharing framework for continual learning to improve parameter utilization and mitigate knowledge forgetting, outperforming static strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based continual learning methods fail to optimally utilize parameters by isolating knowledge across tasks through fixed prompt allocations.

Method: The proposed method introduces a global prompt pool with a gated routing mechanism to dynamically activate and optimize prompts collaboratively, along with a history-aware modulator to protect frequently used prompts.

Result: The framework achieves better performance and efficiency compared to existing static allocation methods, proven through extensive analysis and empirical results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency, paving the way for improved continual learning models using prompt-sharing methods.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

*Luca Pinchetti,Simon Frieder,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Tommaso Salvatori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks, reducing computational demands and improving convergence speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale up neuroscience-inspired, energy-based learning algorithms (e.g., predictive coding) for neural networks, helping them overcome large computational requirements.

Method: The authors propose a novel initialization technique that retains iterative progress made on previous training samples to reduce training times.

Result: The suggested initialization technique significantly enhances convergence speed and improves final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical solution to address computational inefficiencies in predictive coding networks, making them more viable compared to traditional backpropagation methods.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Motivation: To address challenges in modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series data for improved precision oncology and clinical event forecasting.

Method: Developed TwinWeaver, a framework that serializes patient histories into text for analysis with large language models, and built Genie Digital Twin using data from 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types.

Result: GDT outperforms baselines in forecasting accuracy (e.g., reducing error with a median MASE of 0.87 vs. 0.97) and risk stratification (achieves a higher C-index of 0.703 vs. 0.662), and shows generalization capacity for out-of-distribution clinical trials.

Conclusion: TwinWeaver and GDT present a scalable and interpretable solution for longitudinal clinical modeling, advancing precision oncology through improved event prediction and transparent clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

### [181] [Noisy but Valid: Robust Statistical Evaluation of LLMs with Imperfect Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20913)
*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework for reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing judge imperfections by leveraging a small human-labeled calibration set for error-controlled evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and statistically valid approach for certifying the performance and safety of LLMs despite imperfections and biases in automated or noisy evaluation processes.

Method: The study introduces a testing framework that uses a human-labeled calibration set to estimate error rates (TPR/FPR) of noisy LLM judges, deriving variance-corrected thresholds that guarantee Type-I error control while accounting for calibration uncertainty.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and empirical experiments validate the approach, achieving higher statistical power than direct evaluation under conditions suitable for noisy testing, while identifying a gap between practical implementations and the optimal theoretical “Oracle”.

Conclusion: This framework presents a systematic method for addressing noisy judge reliability, improving statistical evaluation of LLMs, and clarifying dependencies on judge quality, dataset size, and certifications.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework to estimate intracranial pressure (ICP) noninvasively using signals like ABP and R-R intervals through system identification and ranking-constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately estimating intracranial pressure (ICP) noninvasively, which is crucial in critical care settings.

Method: A machine learning algorithm was developed, incorporating subspace system identification and convex optimization with ranking constraints to map relationships between noninvasive signal features and ICP estimation errors.

Result: Approximately 31.88% of test cases achieved ICP estimation errors within 2 mmHg, while 34.07% had errors between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg, demonstrating potential accuracy.

Conclusion: The study offers a promising noninvasive ICP estimation approach. While it necessitates further validation and refinement, it lays a foundation for safer and more accessible ICP monitoring in clinical practice.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

*Steve Hanneke,Shay Moran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a complete theory on optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting, identifying four fundamental convergence rates and linking them to combinatorial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the theory of universal rates for binary classification by removing the realizability assumption often present in earlier frameworks.

Method: The authors analyze concept classes and characterize the optimal rates of convergence in binary classification using mathematical and combinatorial approaches.

Result: The study identifies a tetrachotomy of optimal rates ($e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow) and defines the combinatorial structures that determine how concept classes fit into these categories.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of convergence behavior in binary classification, even in the more general agnostic setting, by categorizing universal rates and linking them to structural properties of concept classes.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [184] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel integration of learned models into the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm for monotone optimization, leveraging neural network architectures called HM-RI networks to improve efficiency and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The POA algorithm is effective for monotone optimization problems but struggles with data-driven functions that are not explicitly defined. The authors aim to address this limitation by integrating learned models into POA.

Method: The proposed approach employs Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks designed to enforce monotonicity and homogeneity properties. These networks predict projection primitives directly, avoiding costly bisection procedures in traditional POA.

Result: The method demonstrates theoretical validation of radial inverse functions, compatibility with relaxed monotonicity conditions, and substantial improvements in computation speed across benchmarks, while maintaining high solution quality.

Conclusion: Integrating structured neural networks with POA enables efficient and accurate solutions for data-driven monotone optimization problems, showcasing speed and quality improvements over traditional and baseline methods.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

### [185] [DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824)
*Xinwei Qiang,Hongmin Chen,Shixuan Sun,Jingwen Leng,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance inefficiency in deterministic attention backward passes during Large Language Model (LLM) training, proposing optimized scheduling strategies to enhance throughput by up to 1.28×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in LLM training requires deterministic methods, but this often results in significant performance costs due to hardware underutilization during gradient accumulation.

Method: The backward pass is reformulated as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), leading to DASH—a scheduling framework with two key strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration and (ii) Shift Scheduling.

Result: Empirical tests on NVIDIA H800 GPUs show DASH improves throughput performance of deterministic attention backward passes by up to 1.28× compared to current methods.

Conclusion: DASH enhances deterministic attention efficiency in LLM training, reducing performance loss without sacrificing reproducibility, supporting large-scale training innovative progress in the computational field.

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

TL;DR: The paper integrates active inference into reinforcement learning to enhance sample efficiency in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in reinforcement learning for combining sensory state management and long-term action planning.

Method: Develop a formal abstraction bridging reinforcement learning (model-based, distributional, model-free) and active inference, omitting transition dynamics modeling.

Result: The integration leverages active inference advantages within distributional reinforcement learning framework.

Conclusion: Active inference provides performance enhancements in reinforcement learning solutions for robotic systems effectively.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-trained encoder for global child development, enabling effective monitoring and predictions with limited training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of developmental delays in children and overcome the data bottleneck in deploying machine learning in new countries, where reliable models require large datasets that are often unavailable.

Method: Developed a pre-trained encoder using data from 357,709 children across 44 countries, leveraging UNICEF survey data to enable robust predictions with limited samples.

Result: The pre-trained encoder demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUC of 0.65 with only 50 samples, surpassing traditional methods. It further performed well in zero-shot deployment, attaining AUCs up to 0.84.

Conclusion: Pre-trained encoders can revolutionize ML-based monitoring for child development, making it feasible in resource-constrained settings and advancing SDG 4.2.1 efforts globally.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses efficient top-k item identification using a combination of fast noisy (weak) and high-fidelity expensive (strong) oracles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce reliance on expensive valuations (strong oracle) for identifying top-k items, by utilizing noisy and lower-cost weak oracles effectively.

Method: The paper analyzes a baseline method, proposes the adaptive certification algorithm (ACE), and extends it with an adaptive two-phase method (ACE-W) for better allocation of resources.

Result: The proposed ACE and ACE-W methods reduce the use of the strong oracle while maintaining performance, with ACE achieving a theoretical bound and ACE-W further optimizing strong cost in practice.

Conclusion: The algorithms provide practical solutions to balance cost and accuracy in top-k item identification, showing theoretical and practical advancements.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates energy consumption across generative AI tasks, presenting variations in energy use by models and tasks, and develops a framework for understanding the mechanisms governing energy differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing energy demands in machine learning (ML) necessitate a deeper understanding to optimize energy efficiency during computation.

Method: The study conducts a large-scale empirical analysis with 46 generative AI models, 7 tasks, and 1858 configurations, measuring energy and inference time on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs.

Result: Findings reveal significant energy consumption variations (e.g., up to 100x for video vs. image generation, and 25x among LLM task types), attributable to factors like task type, memory, and GPU utilization.

Conclusion: A proposed analytical framework links time and energy consumption to metrics like memory and utilization, aiding in optimization and improving energy efficiency for power-constrained datacenters.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores neural scaling laws, proposing that width should scale faster than depth for optimal architecture in language models. It identifies the Depth Delusion, where increasing layers beyond a critical threshold harms performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural scaling laws focus only on parameters and data, ignoring the impact of architecture's depth and width.

Method: The authors propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws and validate them empirically on 30 transformer architectures with varied sizes and configurations.

Result: They discover that width should scale 2.8x faster than depth for optimal performance, and increasing layers beyond a critical depth negatively impacts loss despite adding parameters.

Conclusion: Optimal depth-width tradeoffs in transformer architectures remain valid even at large scales, and a deep understanding of these laws is crucial for efficient model development.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

TL;DR: Introducing MADE framework for evaluating iterative materials discovery workflows, simulating real-world constraints and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery rarely encompass the iterative and adaptive nature of actual scientific discovery workflows.

Method: MADE, a framework simulating closed-loop discovery campaigns under constrained budgets, allows customizable workflows utilizing components like generative models, filters, and planners.

Result: Conducted experiments enabling component-wise analysis and scalability assessments of discovery pipelines within complex systems.

Conclusion: MADE provides a versatile platform for benchmarking and optimizing autonomous materials discovery pipelines end-to-end.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmarks to evaluate operational research (OR) tasks involving iterative debugging and rational behavior, showing specialized training outperforms scale in solving these problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of evaluation benchmarks for iterative diagnostic and correction processes in OR, as existing benchmarks focus only on one-shot problem-solving.

Method: The researchers introduced two benchmarks: ORDebug, which evaluates iterative self-correction through a process involving solver execution and IIS recomputation, and ORBias, which measures behavioral rationality using newsvendor problems.

Result: Using these benchmarks, domain-specific RLVR training improves ORDebug recovery rates, diagnostic accuracy, and resolution speed, while curriculum training in ORBias reduces systematic bias significantly.

Conclusion: Process-level evaluation with feedback-based training offers superior performance over model scale alone, proving its effectiveness and efficiency in OR tasks involving diagnostic loops.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated reward discovery process for Meta-Black-Box Optimization using Large Language Models (LLM). It aims to improve optimization performance without relying on human-designed reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome biases and risks of reward hacking in the MetaBBO field caused by human-designed reward functions by leveraging LLM for automated reward strategies.

Method: The authors propose a tailored evolution paradigm for iterative program search with LLM and employ a multi-task evolution architecture to enable parallel reward discovery across MetaBBO approaches.

Result: Empirical results reveal that the discovered reward functions improve MetaBBO performance and support efficient and effective optimization.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of reward design in MetaBBO and demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing LLM for automated reward discovery methods to enhance optimization techniques.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

*Young Kyung Kim,Oded Schlesinger,Qiangqiang Wu,J. Matías Di Martino,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improvement to Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by introducing Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA), which incorporates temporal dynamics to enhance model accuracy while retaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current TTA methods that treat test-time streams as independent samples, ignoring temporal dynamics that can provide additional supervisory signals.

Method: The paper introduces OATTA, a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation method using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior, along with a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) to ensure safety in weakly-structured streams.

Result: OATTA demonstrates its universality across various domains, boosting accuracy significantly, with improvements up to 6.35% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal dynamics during test-time adaptation provides a valuable and complementary signal, enhancing performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

TL;DR: The paper investigates equilibrium propagation in locally connected sparse networks, showing comparable performance to dense networks, offering scalability insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The energy challenges posed by the growth of AI motivate the study of alternatives like neuromorphic computing and equilibrium propagation in realistic architectures.

Method: They use equilibrium propagation to train an XY model on locally connected networks, benchmarking tasks and analyzing spatial responses and coupling evolution.

Result: Sparse, locally connected networks achieve performance similar to densely connected networks in physics-based training, despite architectural constraints.

Conclusion: Sparse architectures can efficiently use equilibrium propagation, aiding scalability in neuromorphic computing models for realistic implementations.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

### [196] [Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21021)
*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the Conditional Denoising Model (CDM), a surrogate model that learns to restore clean physical states from noisy inputs, ensuring adherence to governing equations without requiring explicit physics loss or post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of surrogate modeling for complex physical systems, particularly the trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency, and ensure strict adherence to physical laws.

Method: The proposed method is a generative model (CDM) trained via denoising objectives, learning a vector field that maps noisy approximations to the valid physical solution subspace. Inference involves fixed-point iteration to project states onto the equilibrium manifold without direct exposure to governing equations.

Result: The CDM model shows higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines, while maintaining stricter adherence to physical constraints in low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CDM's denoising objective serves as an implicit regularizer, enabling it to outperform traditional physics-consistent methods in terms of efficiency and adherence to physical laws without explicitly incorporating governing equations.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address challenges in modeling PPG signals, which suffer from intrinsic redundancy and noise, and where standard masked modeling and contrastive methods fall short.

Method: The proposed SIGMA-PPG model uses a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism driven by reinforcement learning and a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to enhance performance.

Result: SIGMA-PPG was pre-trained on 120,000+ hours of data and achieved superior performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The SIGMA-PPG model effectively tackles noise and redundancy issues in PPG signal analysis, providing enhanced performance and practicality for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

### [198] [Predict-Project-Renoise: Sampling Diffusion Models under Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21033)
*Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Gilles Louppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose a constrained sampling framework for neural diffusion models to enforce physical laws or constraints during generation, enhancing accuracy and consistency in scientific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural emulators based on diffusion models struggle to maintain physical accuracy and satisfy constraints, hampering their applicability in scientific domains.

Method: A novel constrained forward process is introduced, emphasizing diffusion over constraint-satisfying samples, alongside the Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) algorithm which iteratively denoises, projects onto constraints, and renoises to ensure accuracy.

Result: The PPR algorithm significantly reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude and delivers better consistency and closer alignment with true constrained distributions in experiments covering 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the reliability of neural diffusion models for scientific problems, ensuring both constraint satisfaction and higher fidelity outputs.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of video generation models for visual reasoning, highlighting their robust zero-shot generalization, effective use of visual context, and scalability in test-time for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of vision-language models in fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning by employing video generation as a dynamic reasoning mechanism.

Method: The authors formulate visual reasoning through video generation models and validate their performance in two tasks: Maze Navigation (discrete planning) and Tangram Puzzle (continuous manipulation).

Result: The experiments show that the model demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, effectively uses visual context (like agent icons and tangram shapes), and scales well during test-time for complex paths, enhancing planning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that video generation presents a scalable and generalizable paradigm for complex visual reasoning tasks, surpassing traditional vision-language models in key aspects.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

*Elizabeth L. Baker,Alexander Denker,Jes Frellsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses conditioning score-based diffusion models in function spaces for inverse problems, proposing a theoretically grounded and efficient method for posterior sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the sampling of posteriors in Bayesian inverse problems in infinite-dimensional function spaces using score-based diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's h-transform for conditioning and introduce Supervised Guidance Training as a simulation-free score matching objective to efficiently sample from the posterior.

Result: The results include theoretical proofs of the proposed conditioning method and numerical examples highlighting effective posterior sampling for Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first method to fine-tune trained diffusion models in function spaces, allowing accurate posterior sampling for solving inverse problems.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

*Yiqiao Liao,Farinaz Koushanfar,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TACO, a test-time adaptation framework unifying generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization approaches, achieving superior performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing neural combinatorial optimization approaches, which either generalize across instances but lack adaptability, or adapt to individual instances but fail to leverage learned structures.

Method: TACO is a model-agnostic framework that strategically applies partial relaxation of trained parameters during test-time to enable efficient and flexible unsupervised adaptation while retaining inductive biases.

Result: TACO outperforms both naive fine-tuning and instance-specific optimization methods, demonstrating superior solution quality on various combinatorial optimization problems like Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique.

Conclusion: TACO effectively bridges generalizable and instance-specific neural combinatorial optimization approaches, showing its robustness and efficacy across diverse, static, and dynamic problems.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

### [202] [SMKC: Sketch Based Kernel Correlation Images for Variable Cardinality Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21050)
*Haokun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMKC, a framework for anomaly detection in scenarios with sensor churn and dynamic input structures in multivariate time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of anomaly detection when signals fluctuate in availability, names, or cardinality in operational environments with sensor churn.

Method: SMKC employs permutation-invariant feature hashing, constructs hybrid kernel images for sequence analysis, and uses masked reconstruction along with teacher-student prediction for learning normal patterns.

Result: SMKC's robust log-distance channels proved to be highly discriminative, outperforming cosine representations. It also shows high competitiveness in performance with pre-trained baselines using random projections and nearest neighbors without training updates.

Conclusion: The SMKC framework effectively addresses sensor churn challenges and provides a practical, resource-efficient anomaly detection solution.

Abstract: Conventional anomaly detection in multivariate time series relies on the assumption that the set of observed variables remains static. In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments.

Conclusion: Snowball demonstrates a promising digital solution for Ising machines, offering better performance and scalability by addressing key challenges in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUBo-GFN, a GFlowNet variant leveraging submodular rewards to improve generative capabilities and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited efficiency of classical GFNs in generating training data and exploring compositional objects with structured (submodular) rewards.

Method: Introduced SUBo-GFN, which employs submodular upper bounds on reward functions to improve training and sampling efficiency in GFlowNets.

Result: SUBo-GFN significantly outperforms classical GFNs in generating training data, aligning distributions, and identifying high-quality candidates in submodular tasks.

Conclusion: Combining the structure of submodular rewards with SUBo-GFN enhances GFlowNet performance, maximizing efficiency and quality in various applications.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-LLM collaborative framework to enhance feature engineering for tabular datasets, improving performance and easing cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using LLMs for feature engineering lack effective strategies to evaluate and prioritize proposed operations, often leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The framework decouples proposal and selection processes, utilizes LLMs for generating transformation candidates, and introduces human feedback on operation utility to guide selection.

Result: Evaluations demonstrate improved feature engineering performance and reduced user cognitive load across various datasets.

Conclusion: Combining LLM-generated proposals with human-guided selection yields more effective feature engineering results and makes the process easier for users.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method for the early detection of emergent phenomena in complex systems by revealing latent causal structures despite limited and partially observed data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent phenomena often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems, presenting challenges in prediction and understanding due to unknown and partially observed data-generating processes.

Method: A machine learning approach based on feature learning from a family of estimators (covariance/precision matrix powers) is proposed. The learned optimal representation is classified by a supervised learning module.

Result: The method demonstrates structural consistency and achieves competitive results in seizure detection and customer churn prediction. It ensures explainable predictive performance by capturing structural signatures of the systems studied.

Conclusion: This approach reconciles predictive accuracy with interpretability, offering insights into latent causal structures and enabling robust early detection of critical events in complex systems.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

*Minghui Chen,Wenlong Deng,James Zou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP) as a method to optimize compound AI systems with deep workflows without suffering from textual gradient issues like exploding or vanishing feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face performance degradation in multi-module systems with deep workflows due to gradient issues when optimizing them globally.

Method: TEP utilizes a two-phase method: 1) local refinement of prompts until equilibrium is reached (free phase), and 2) proximal adjustments using controlled task-level objectives (nudged phase), avoiding global textual backpropagation.

Result: TEP improves accuracy and efficiency in long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent datasets, outperforming global propagation methods, particularly as system depth increases.

Conclusion: Using TEP for long-horizon workflows in compound AI systems mitigates textual gradient problems and provides scalable optimization, supporting depth scaling without losing effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PLS methods struggle with paired datasets that have substantial missing entries. The paper aims to address this limitation and understand PLS's performance under missing data scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze PLS in high-dimensional settings under a spiked random matrix model affected by missing-completely-at-random entries. They derive asymptotic formulas and propose a theoretical framework for understanding its behavior.

Result: They discovered a phase transition in PLS performance depending on signal-to-noise ratios, with clear formulas predicting alignment performance above and below the threshold. Simulations support these claims.

Conclusion: The study provides a mathematical understanding of PLS performance in multimodal datasets with missing data, offering insights for practical data recovery.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

### [209] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21067)
*Haoyang Li,Haibo Chen,Xin Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews graph foundation models (GFMs), focusing on their ability to generalize under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graph-based applications face challenges in dealing with distribution shifts. GFMs aim to address these challenges through pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks.

Method: The paper examines challenges caused by distribution shifts, organizes existing GFMs approaches based on task specifications, reviews handling strategies, and summarizes pretraining objectives for OOD generalization.

Result: The survey identifies methods, objectives, and evaluation protocols used for OOD generalization in GFMs, classifying approaches as per fixed or heterogeneous task specifications.

Conclusion: This work sets a foundation for understanding challenges, strategies, and future research directions in OOD generalization for GFMs.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

### [210] [Achieving $\varepsilon^{-2}$ Dependence for Average-Reward Q-Learning with a New Contraction Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21301)
*Zijun Chen,Zaiwei Chen,Nian Si,Shengbo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, addressing challenges posed by the lack of contraction while achieving optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of contraction in average-reward Markov decision processes and overcome limitations of existing approaches that impose strong assumptions or rely on suboptimal approximations.

Method: Introduced a lazified dynamics approach for Q-learning under a reachability assumption, where a lazy transformation ensures system remains longer in current state, enabling construction of a seminorm for analyzing contractiveness.

Result: Achieved optimal sample complexity guarantees of $O(^{-2})$, demonstrating effective convergence rates for the synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning under proposed modifications.

Conclusion: The lazy transformation and instance-dependent seminorm provide a robust way to enforce contractiveness, leading to efficient learning rates for average-reward Markov decision processes.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

*Shivam Patel,William Cocke,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOCUS generates efficient embeddings for language models, enabling better routing and model management without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing the vast pool of evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly complex, necessitating an effective representation system.

Method: LOCUS uses an attention-based approach with deterministic forward passes over queries and evaluation scores, producing embeddings without retraining while incorporating new models.

Result: LOCUS achieves state-of-the-art routing accuracy, uses fewer query samples, and creates geometrically meaningful embedding spaces for model applications.

Conclusion: LOCUS streamlines model representation and management for effective downstream applications, demonstrating efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

### [212] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses partial-feedback online learning, where a learner observes only one correct label per round from a set of correct labels, with focus on characterizing minimax regret in learnability under deterministic and randomized settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to analyze partial-feedback online learning scenarios, such as language generation, where multiple valid outcomes exist but data only provide limited guidance by exposing a single correct option.

Method: Novel dimensions (PFLdim and PMSdim) are introduced to characterize learnability and minimax regret for deterministic and randomized learners, alongside auxiliary proof tools. Broad structural conditions ensuring inseparability and extensions for set-valued learning are explored.

Result: The study identifies precise bounds for deterministic and randomized learners, resolves questions on set-valued online learning, and demonstrates sharp separations from realistic and agnostic learning variants.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that beyond set realizability, the task becomes intractable without developing new noise-sensitive complexity measures and emphasizes the foundational importance of such measures in future research.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

*Marvin Sextro,Weronika Kłos,Gabriel Dernbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MapPFN, a tool for predicting biological intervention effects in unseen contexts using in-context learning, pretrained on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of single-cell perturbation datasets and existing methods that fail to adapt to new interventional evidence beyond their training data.

Method: MapPFN leverages the prior-data fitted network (PFN) framework, pretrained on synthetic causal perturbation data, to predict post-perturbation distributions without requiring gradient-based optimization.

Result: MapPFN successfully identifies differentially expressed genes and performs comparably to models trained on real-world single-cell data, even when pretrained on synthetic gene knockout data.

Conclusion: MapPFN demonstrates the potential of meta-learning with synthetic data to generalize and adapt to unseen biological contexts for predicting intervention effects.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

### [214] [PPI-SVRG: Unifying Prediction-Powered Inference and Variance Reduction for Semi-Supervised Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21470)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Haoyang Liu,David Simchi-Levi,Will Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPI-SVRG, a novel semi-supervised stochastic optimization method that merges PPI and SVRG to improve performance when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing performance in scenarios where labeled data is limited but predictions from pre-trained models are available.

Method: The authors establish a mathematical equivalence between PPI (using predictions) and SVRG (using reference gradients) and create PPI-SVRG, combining the strengths of both. They provide theoretical convergence bounds and analyze the influence of prediction quality on stability and convergence.

Result: Theoretical analysis reveals convergence depends on loss geometry and prediction quality. Experiments show PPI-SVRG significantly reduces MSE on benchmarks (by 43-52%) and improves MNIST test accuracy by ~2.8 percentage points with only 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: PPI-SVRG effectively addresses optimization under label scarcity, blending PPI and SVRG while maintaining robustness to prediction quality. The approach demonstrates both theoretical soundness and practical benefits.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

*Minjae Kwon,Josephine Lamp,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies whether safety guarantees from training for reinforcement learning can generalize under distribution shifts, with a focus on diabetes management. The authors reveal safety gaps and propose test-time shielding to improve safety and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical issue of whether safety guarantees during reinforcement learning training effectively translate to safety in deployment, especially for high-stakes applications like diabetes management.

Method: The authors benchmark various safe RL algorithms on a clinical simulator to identify safety generalization gaps and employ test-time shielding with learned dynamics models to mitigate unsafe actions during deployment.

Result: Across different RL algorithms, diabetes types, and age groups, test-time shielding improves safety and performance metrics, including Time-in-Range gains of 13--14% for leading algorithms and reductions in clinical risks.

Conclusion: Test-time shielding restores safety and enhances performance of safe RL algorithms under distribution shift in critical domains like diabetes management, demonstrating its efficacy in bridging the safety generalization gap.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

### [216] [Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Siyang Gao,Hanwei Li,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) with access to biased proxies (e.g., LLM judges) and selectively acquired ground truth labels. It develops a new estimator and algorithm to handle bias and improve efficiency while ensuring accurate decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inefficiency and potential inaccuracy in best-arm identification when relying on biased proxies and limited ground-truth labels, as standard methods fail to address these challenges effectively.

Method: The authors developed an estimator combining proxy scores and inverse-propensity-weighted residuals, designed anytime-valid confidence sequences, and proposed an adaptive algorithm concentrating audits on unreliable contexts and close arms.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates near-oracle efficiency by concentrating limited audits effectively and surpasses baseline performance in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The approach achieves both theoretical guarantees and superior empirical results, providing an efficient and reliable solution for fixed-confidence BAI with biased proxies and selective ground truth acquisition.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

### [217] [TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135)
*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRACE, a framework for handling transitional causal mechanisms represented as continuous mixing trajectories, achieving high accuracy in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal learning methods assume mechanisms switch discretely, which isn't realistic for systems with continuous transitions, like human movement or vehicle dynamics.

Method: The authors model transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of atomic mechanisms with time-varying coefficients, establishing their identifiability. They propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework, where each expert learns one atomic mechanism for capturing continuous transitions.

Result: TRACE demonstrated up to 0.99 correlation in recovering mixing trajectories in both synthetic and real-world datasets, surpassing baseline models that assume discrete switching.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of modeling and recovering continuous transitions in causal mechanisms, generalizing to previously unseen states.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

*Kevin Han,Haolin Cong,Bowen Deng,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic cutoff for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), reducing memory and inference time without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLIPs are limited by high memory consumption and slow inference time, which hinder their usability in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Method: A new dynamic cutoff formulation that adapts the neighborhood size for atoms, inducing sparsity in the atom graph while maintaining stable, long-term molecular simulations.

Result: Implemented on 4 MLIP models, the dynamic cutoff achieved up to 2.26x less memory usage and 2.04x faster inference time, with minimal accuracy reduction on materials and molecular data.

Conclusion: Dynamic cutoff formulations can significantly improve MLIP efficiency while maintaining stable and accurate simulations, advancing their application to larger simulation scales. Code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models (LLMs) and introduces the Reset-and-Discard (ReD) method to optimize their performance on verifiable tasks, reducing cost and attempts while maximizing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of LLMs on verifiable tasks, addressing the issue of diminishing returns in the coverage metric at fixed budgets.

Method: The researchers connect two metrics, pass@k and coverage@cost, and identify the power-law behavior leading to reduced efficiency. They propose the ReD method to boost coverage@cost, predict savings, and infer power-law exponents when pass@k is unavailable.

Result: Experiments with three LLMs on HumanEval show that ReD significantly lowers attempts, tokens, and costs while achieving desired coverage and measuring inference power-laws.

Conclusion: The ReD method is an effective tool for optimizing LLM performance on verifiable tasks, improving efficiency and cost reduction under any pass@k distribution.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

TL;DR: PRISM is a RCA framework excelling in scenarios without dependency graphs, with high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in RCA where faults propagate and there is no dependency graph.

Method: PRISM identifies root causes in component-based systems without dependency graphs, with a theoretical guarantee.

Result: Achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms baselines by 258% on 9 datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM is an efficient, accurate method for RCA in complex systems without dependency graphs.

Abstract: Failures in complex systems demand rapid Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to prevent cascading damage. Existing RCA methods that operate without dependency graph typically assume that the root cause having the highest anomaly score. This assumption fails when faults propagate, as a small delay at the root cause can accumulate into a much larger anomaly downstream. In this paper, we propose PRISM, a simple and efficient framework for RCA when the dependency graph is absent. We formulate a class of component-based systems under which PRISM performs RCA with theoretical guarantees. On 735 failures across 9 real-world datasets, PRISM achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy, a 258% improvement over the best baseline, while requiring only 8ms per diagnosis.

*Maria Despoina Siampou,Shushman Choudhury,Shang-Ling Hsu,Neha Arora,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), combining language models and human mobility data to create use-focused, context-independent POI representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing geospatial POI models by incorporating functional usage data into POI representations.

Method: Proposes ME-POIs, which align embeddings derived from language models and human mobility data using contrastive learning and propagate temporal patterns to handle visit sparsity.

Result: ME-POIs outperforms existing text-only and mobility-only baselines in new map enrichment tasks, proving that POI function improves generalizable representations.

Conclusion: The integration of POI function through mobility data is key to enhancing POI representation models for practical and functional insights.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

TL;DR: The paper offers improved privacy amplification methods for differential privacy in matrix factorization using sampling-free bounds, overcoming limitations of earlier Monte Carlo approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing privacy amplification methods for differential private training models in balls-in-bins scenarios, providing more robust and efficient guarantees without requiring random abstention.

Method: Developed sampling-free bounds using Rényi divergence and conditional composition, combined with dynamic programming for computational efficiency.

Result: The framework offers stronger privacy guarantees, especially for small $ε$, without over-relying on sampling-based techniques, and applies to both banded and non-banded matrices.

Conclusion: This approach improves privacy amplification robustness and efficiency, providing more reliable bounds in differential privacy applications for matrix factorization models.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the capability of neural networks trained on fixed mathematical tasks to derive broader abstract structures, exploring their representation of group-theoretic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push the use of AI in mathematical progress beyond traditional question answering methods by exploring how AI models can uncover abstract mathematical structures.

Method: Experimental training of neural networks to predict group operations and subsequent tests to assess their ability to capture group-theoretic aspects like identity elements, commutativity, and subgroups.

Result: The models demonstrated representations capable of capturing certain group-theoretic properties, such as commutativity and subgroup distinction, but failed with others like identity recognition.

Conclusion: Small neural networks have the potential to discover abstract mathematical structures, but their capacity is limited and requires further exploration for comprehensive breakthroughs.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies in current machine-learning-based weather forecasting architectures, specifically in handling long-range transport (advection) and improving computational costs.

Method: PARADIS is designed with inductive biases for advection, diffusion, and reaction processes, incorporating a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator for advection and other physics-based components to handle processes efficiently in a latent space.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art weather forecast accuracy and efficiency on ERA5 benchmarks, matching or surpassing high-resolution traditional and ML-based baselines, including ECMWF HRES and DeepMind's GraphCast.

Conclusion: PARADIS achieves excellent forecast skill with significant training cost reductions by integrating physics-inspired decomposition, making it a compelling tool for weather prediction.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

*Michael Ibrahim,Nagi Gebraeel,Weijun Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedGEM, a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for clustering with an unknown number of clusters across decentralized clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for federated clustering methods to handle heterogeneous, overlapping cluster sets when the total number of clusters is unknown.

Method: FedGEM uses local EM steps at client side and central server computations to identify overlaps and infer global cluster numbers using theoretical guarantees and isotropic GMM-specific formulations.

Result: Experiments show FedGEM performs comparably to centralized EM and surpasses existing federated clustering approaches.

Conclusion: FedGEM offers a practical and theoretically supported method for federated clustering with unknown components, improving over other methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

### [226] [LoRA and Privacy: When Random Projections Help (and When They Don't)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21719)
*Yaxi Hu,Johanna Düngler,Bernhard Schölkopf,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Wishart projection mechanism for randomized differential privacy, proving its effectiveness for vector-valued queries but highlighting vulnerabilities for matrix-valued ones. It explores privacy amplification in a noisy setting and evaluates implications for LoRA-style updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the potential of the Wishart projection mechanism as a noise-free approach to differential privacy, addressing limitations in current practices such as additive noise for vector- and matrix-valued queries.

Method: The mechanism projects input using Wishart-distributed randomness and analyzes its impact on differentially private guarantees for vector- and matrix-valued queries. They analyze both noise-free and noisy cases, demonstrating privacy properties and vulnerabilities.

Result: The Wishart projection guarantees privacy for vector-valued queries without added noise. However, it fails for noise-free matrix-valued queries, shown through membership inference attacks. Adding noise and low-rank projections enhance privacy in matrix-valued cases. LoRA updates are found inherently unprivate, though low-rank fine-tuning shows improved privacy over full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of Wishart projections in differential privacy, suggesting that while they work well for vectors, added noise and low-rank mechanisms are essential for matrices. This has implications for practical fine-tuning methods like LoRA.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

*Jinjun Peng,Magnus Saebo,Tianjun Zhong,Yi-Jie Cheng,Junfeng Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Simin Chen,Yangruibo Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies a capability gap in Small Language Models (SLMs) when handling unfamiliar codebases and proposes Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) to address it. The approach improves training efficiency and inference costs while enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) are needed in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments, but they lack strong generalization for working with complicated, unfamiliar codebases due to limitations in existing Task-Centric Learning.

Method: The paper introduces Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), which emphasizes deep learning from specific repositories rather than across many tasks. It uses a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience to train specialized models.

Result: The resulting model, SWE-Spot-4B, surpasses or matches larger open-weight and efficiency-focused models in performance across various software engineering tasks, demonstrating improved training sample efficiency and cost reduction.

Conclusion: Repository-Centric Learning enables SLMs to achieve better repository mastery, enhanced efficiency, and performance, offering a necessary complement to general coding abilities in building effective SLMs for constrained environments.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

*Shuai Liu,Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Botao Hao,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective, proposing algorithms with near-optimal guarantees and providing the first results for the logistic setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in simple regret guarantees for the logistic case of stochastic contextual bandits, which were known for the linear case but not for the logistic setting.

Method: The paper builds on contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis to propose algorithms such as a deterministic method achieving regret bounds of ~O(d/√T) and a Thompson Sampling variant achieving ~O(d^(3/2)/√T).

Result: Confirmed simple regret bounds with no dependence on an exponential parameter in the leading term, and demonstrated efficient randomized algorithms outperforming deterministic ones computationally.

Conclusion: Novel algorithms achieving near-optimal simple regret bounds for stochastic contextual logistic bandits were developed, offering both theoretical and empirical validation of their effectiveness.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

*Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Jose I. Mestre,Manuel F. Dolz,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why the Adam optimizer performs better when momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$ and attributes the improvement to gradient scale invariance. It offers theoretical and experimental evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover the reason behind the improved performance of the Adam optimizer when $β_{1}=β_{2}$ and provide insight into optimizing large-scale training.

Method: The paper formalizes the notion of gradient scale invariance and demonstrates theoretically that Adam exhibits this property only when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Experiments across various tasks and architectures support the theory.

Result: It is shown that Adam is gradient scale invariant of the first order only when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Experiments demonstrate smoother gradient effects improving performance under this condition.

Conclusion: The findings explain a key aspect of Adam's behavior, offering insights into its optimization and guiding future optimizer design with gradient scale invariance principles.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

*Fernando Palafox,Jingqi Li,Jesse Milzman,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a versatile framework for active information gathering in unknown dynamical systems, decoupling modeling choices from cost and deriving generalizable metrics using Markov dynamics and additive noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing information-gathering methods that rely on tailored costs for specific modeling choices in dynamical systems.

Method: The framework uses Massey's directed information to define a generic cost, demonstrates its generality compared to mutual information costs, and connects it to Bayesian estimation for active learning validation.

Result: The derived cost generalizes mutual information, validates mutual information-based active learning, and is practically useful across various system types, including multi-agent and nonlinear setups.

Conclusion: The framework broadens theoretical foundations and enhances practical application for active learning in dynamical systems by providing a generalized and modeling-agnostic approach.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

*Kamal Berahmand,Saman Forouzandeh,Mehrnoush Mohammadi,Parham Moradi,Mahdi Jalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the AC2L-GAD framework for graph anomaly detection, improving efficiency and detection quality using counterfactual reasoning and active selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph anomaly detection is challenging due to label scarcity and extreme class imbalance, while existing contrastive learning methods fail to ensure semantic consistency and informative contrasts.

Method: The AC2L-GAD framework combines active selection with counterfactual generation to identify complex nodes, produce informative augmentations, and reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show the framework achieves competitive or superior results with a 65% reduction in computational overhead.

Conclusion: AC2L-GAD efficiently enhances graph anomaly detection, particularly in scenarios with complex anomaly interactions.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECSEL, an explainable classification method using signomial equations, offering both classification and interpretability with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for explainable machine learning methods that can represent data compactly and transparently, specifically by leveraging signomial equations for classification and interpretation.

Method: The method involves constructing structural, closed-form expressions (signomial equations) for classification and explanation, evaluated against symbolic regression benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Result: ECSEL outperforms competing approaches in recovering target equations, achieves competitive classification accuracy, and reveals actionable insights in datasets like e-commerce and fraud detection.

Conclusion: ECSEL offers an efficient, interpretable, and accurate classification framework that supports transparency, insight generation, and counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Kexuan Xin,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of existing entity alignment (EA) models in performing on unseen knowledge graphs (KGs), introducing a novel EA foundation model with parallel encoding strategy for improved transferability and reasoning efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EA models struggle to align unseen knowledge graphs (KGs) without retraining, indicating a lack of transferability. Efficient alignment across sparse, heterogeneous KG structures remains challenging, highlighting the need for a more adaptable approach.

Method: The authors propose an EA foundation model featuring a parallel encoding strategy, which uses seed EA pairs as local anchors. This enables anchor-conditioned message passing and reduces the reliance on global search by leveraging local structural proximity. Additionally, a merged relation graph and learnable interaction module improve global dependency modeling and matching precision.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively aligns entities in unseen KGs, showcasing strong generalizability and improved performance over existing models.

Conclusion: The novel EA foundation model successfully addresses the reasoning horizon gap in traditional EA setups, offering enhanced transferability and generalizability for unseen KG alignment applications.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flow Perturbation++, an unbiased, variance-reduced method for high-dimensional Boltzmann sampling, which exhibits improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous normalizing flows face scalability issues in high-dimensional systems for unbiased Boltzmann sampling, due to computational costs and biases in existing Jacobian estimators.

Method: The authors propose Flow Perturbation++, which discretizes probability-flow ODEs and uses unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation to reduce variance while maintaining unbiasedness.

Result: Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on high-dimensional models like a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses high-dimensional scalability challenges in unbiased Boltzmann sampling, combining computational efficiency with accuracy.

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) for addressing biases in generative models without altering sampling dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often suffer from systematic biases that impact the quality of high-dimensional samples.

Method: The paper presents a Bi-stage Flow Refinement framework, which includes latent space alignment and data space refinement strategies to correct biases post-hoc.

Result: The approach achieves substantial improvements in fidelity and sample coverage across datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ, attaining state-of-the-art FID performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Bi-stage Flow Refinement provides an effective solution to enhance sample quality in generative models without perturbing the original sampling dynamics.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transfer learning framework for matrix estimation when both ambient dimension and intrinsic representation grow. It decomposes the target parameter into embedded source, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, with theoretical and empirical validity demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for transfer learning when representations grow over time, embedding earlier ones into larger spaces. It aims to improve estimation efficiency for matrix problems under such growth.

Method: The authors propose an anchored alternating projection estimator that separates and efficiently estimates components like embedded source data, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits. The framework is applied to Markov transition matrix and structured covariance estimation problems.

Result: The framework achieves error bounds showing separation of target noise, representation growth, and source error. It improves estimation rates under controlled sparsity and rank changes, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical gains demonstrated.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across tasks, effectively transferring structured knowledge, and provides improved estimation accuracy under joint representation and dimension growth.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

*Weiguang Wang,Yong Liu,Yingjie Gao,Guangyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method for SSVEP-based BCIs, effectively enhancing signal decoding through self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP signals are highly valuable for brain-computer interfaces, but their variability across subjects and the cost of user-specific annotation hinder decoding accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces a three-part system: Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) for frequency exploitation, Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework with two stages (PTAL and DEST), and a TFA-CL module for better feature discriminability.

Result: Experiments on Benchmark and BETA datasets show state-of-the-art recognition performance across different signal lengths using this method.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses decoding challenges in SSVEP-based BCIs, demonstrating its effectiveness and leading-edge accuracy in cross-subject applications.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

*Gloria Felicia,Michael Eniolade,Jinfeng He,Zitha Sasindran,Hemant Kumar,Milan Hussain Angati,Sandeep Bandarupalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces StepShield, a benchmark that evaluates the timing (when) of detecting agent violations instead of just whether they occurred. It proposes new metrics and demonstrates their practical advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent safety benchmarks lack the ability to measure when a violation is detected, crucial for effective early interventions and safety management.

Method: The authors created StepShield, a dataset and benchmark with annotated code agent trajectories, and designed temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate, Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. They analyzed performance using both LLM-based and static analyzers.

Result: StepShield reveals significant differences in the timing of violation detection. For example, an LLM-based detector achieved 59% Early Intervention Rate, outperforming static analyzers by 2.3x. Furthermore, economic savings are showcased via a cascaded detector system.

Conclusion: StepShield shifts the evaluation criteria from binary accuracy to temporal detection, offering a robust foundation for creating safer, cost-effective AI systems, with significant economic and operational implications.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training is underexplored, creating a need for systematic analysis of local consistency and harmonicity in these models.

Method: A cellular sheaf theoretic framework is introduced to model feature alignment and agreements on graph-based architectures. Additionally, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed for capturing hierarchical feature interactions.

Result: The proposed framework provides a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation in GDL and TDL architectures, enabling joint characterization based on geometric and topological structures.

Conclusion: This study offers insights into feature behaviors in GDL and TDL and demonstrates the framework’s potential for tasks like node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

### [240] [Temporal Context and Architecture: A Benchmark for Naturalistic EEG Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21215)
*Mehmet Ergezer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates EEG decoding models using various architectures (CNN, LSTM, EEGXF, S4, S5) on naturalistic data and finds S5 achieves high accuracy with fewer parameters, while EEGXF excels in robustness under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the interaction between model architecture and temporal context in EEG decoding, with an emphasis on accuracy, parameter efficiency, and real-world robustness.

Method: The authors benchmarked five EEG decoding architectures (CNN, LSTM, EEGXF, S4, S5) using the HBN movie-watching dataset across varying segment lengths, and evaluated real-world scenarios like cross-frequency shifts, out-of-distribution tasks, and cross-subject generalization.

Result: S5 achieved the highest accuracy (98.7%) with significantly fewer parameters, while EEGXF demonstrated better robustness but less in-distribution calibration.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between efficiency and robustness: S5 is ideal for parameter-efficient peak accuracy, while EEGXF is preferred for robustness and conservative uncertainty.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

*Daniel T. Bernstein,Luca Di Carlo,David Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 'soft quantization' approach for neural network weight quantization using short-range attractive couplings during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficient model compression while maintaining high performance and to explore the relationship between compression and generalization in neural networks.

Method: Short-range attractive couplings are applied to neural network weights during training, which induces soft quantization and discretizes the weight distribution in a mixed-precision manner.

Result: 'Soft quantization' outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Soft quantization offers a flexible and effective pipeline for model compression and provides insights into compression-generalization trade-offs.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

### [242] [Optimistic Transfer under Task Shift via Bellman Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21924)
*Jinhang Chai,Enpei Zhang,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Re-weighted Targeting (RWT), a methodology addressing task mismatch in online reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing operator-level corrections based on Bellman alignment for effective transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve online reinforcement learning in scenarios where data from related tasks (source tasks) is available, but naive usage of such data leads to bias and undermines performance. An effective framework for statistically valid data reuse across tasks is needed.

Method: The proposed method introduces one-step Bellman alignment to address task mismatch. It develops an operator-level correction through Re-weighted Targeting (RWT) to account for transition differences, separating variance reduction from bias correction within a two-stage Q-learning framework.

Result: The paper provides theoretical regret bounds that depend on task shift complexity rather than target Markov Decision Process (MDP) complexity. Empirical results show that the approach outperforms single-task learning and naive data pooling in both tabular and neural network environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Bellman alignment enables model-agnostic and statistically sound transfer learning, offering a practical and effective solution for online RL with task reusability.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Kendra Givens,Peilun Li,Thomas Beckers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHDME, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion model designed for reliable forecasting in sparse data systems and incomplete physics knowledge, demonstrating improved accuracy and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of diffusion models in sparse data regimes and the limitations of existing physics-informed machine learning approaches that require explicit governing equations.

Method: The proposed approach trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) to model dynamics, generates a synthetic physics-consistent dataset for diffusion training, integrates physics residual loss, and applies diffusion for trajectory forecasting with uncertainty calibration using split conformal methods.

Result: The experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system validate the model's enhanced accuracy and physical consistency, even with limited data.

Conclusion: PHDME effectively combines physical priors and machine learning, offering a robust and accurate solution for dynamics forecasting in scenarios with sparse observations and incomplete physics.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

*Luwei Sun,Dongrui Shen,Jianfe Li,Yulong Zhao,Han Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in conditional generative modeling by introducing a deep learning framework using SignReLU activations to approximate ratio-based functionals, with theoretical performance guarantees for diffusion-based generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the difficulty in handling complex conditional densities expressed as ratios in generative modeling, crucial for improving diffusion-based models.

Method: The authors employ kernel-based marginal densities and develop approximation results using deep neural networks with SignReLU activations, supported by L^p bounds and convergence analysis.

Result: They provide theoretical guarantees, including approximation and convergence bounds, and bounds on excess KL risk for diffusion-based generative models like DDPMs.

Conclusion: The framework offers provable generalization capabilities for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models, advancing their accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting and temporal misalignment in SNNs for lifelong learning, which limits their application in CIL compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Method: STAER utilizes Soft-DTW loss for spike timing alignment and applies temporal expansion/contraction of output logits, incorporated into a ResNet19 spiking backbone, along with experience replay.

Result: STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10, matching or outperforming strong ANN baselines while maintaining biologically plausible dynamics.

Conclusion: Temporal alignment significantly enhances the representational stability of SNNs, making STAER a scalable and effective solution for lifelong learning in neural networks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are inherently suited for continuous learning due to their event-driven temporal dynamics; however, their application to Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has been hindered by catastrophic forgetting and the temporal misalignment of spike patterns. In this work, we introduce Spiking Temporal Alignment with Experience Replay (STAER), a novel framework that explicitly preserves temporal structure to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. Our approach integrates a differentiable Soft-DTW alignment loss to maintain spike timing fidelity and employs a temporal expansion and contraction mechanism on output logits to enforce robust representation learning. Implemented on a deep ResNet19 spiking backbone, STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10. Empirical results demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms strong ANN baselines (ER, DER++) while preserving biologically plausible dynamics. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit temporal alignment is critical for representational stability, positioning STAER as a scalable solution for spike-native lifelong learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To incorporate biological realism into neural network design by leveraging detailed connectivity data from a mouse primary visual cortex.

Method: The neural network integrates architectural constraints like laminar organization and biological learning rules such as Hebbian plasticity, homeostasis, and synaptic noise, with convolutional layers mimicking retinotopic mapping.

Result: BioNIC achieved similar performance to conventional models, with ~59.77% accuracy on FER-2013 while adhering to biologically inspired constraints.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired constraints derived from connectomics are computationally effective and highlight the utility of large connectomics datasets for advancing AI and neuroscience.

Abstract: We present BioNIC, a multi-layer feedforward neural network for emotion classification, inspired by detailed synaptic connectivity graphs from the MICrONs dataset. At a structural level, we incorporate architectural constraints derived from a single cortical column of the mouse Primary Visual Cortex(V1): connectivity imposed via adjacency masks, laminar organization, and graded inhibition representing inhibitory neurons. At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013. Our findings demonstrate that integrating constraints derived from connectomics is a computationally plausible approach to developing biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems. This work also highlights the potential of new generation peta-scale connectomics data in advancing both neuroscience modeling and artificial intelligence.

### [247] [Diversifying Toxicity Search in Large Language Models Through Speciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20981)
*Onkar Shelar,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved method, ToxSearch-S, for generating diverse high-toxicity prompts for red teaming large language models through unsupervised speciation, showing enhanced performance and broader semantic and behavioral coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for red teaming LLMs often focus on optimizing single, high-performing prompts, which limits exploration of diverse failure modes.

Method: The authors propose a speciated quality-diversity approach, ToxSearch-S, using capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, reserve pools for outliers, and species-aware parent selection to balance exploitation and exploration.

Result: ToxSearch-S achieved higher peak toxicity, broader semantic coverage, extreme heavier toxicity tail, and behavioral differentiation across niches compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The speciation-based methodology effectively uncovers diverse adversarial strategies by partitioning the search space into behaviorally unique niches, enhancing LLM robustness testing.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt search is a practical black-box approach for red teaming large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often collapse onto a small family of high-performing prompts, limiting coverage of distinct failure modes. We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainFuse, a platform that unites biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning to foster cross-disciplinary synergies between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing divide between neuroscience and artificial intelligence stems from incompatible infrastructures. Modern AI lacks support for biophysical realism, and neural simulation tools are unsuited for AI optimization and hardware deployment.

Method: BrainFuse was developed as a platform with three capabilities: integrating neuronal dynamics into differentiable learning, optimizing neural computations on GPUs, and enabling scalable deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

Result: BrainFuse accelerates neuronal computations, powers multiscale neural modeling (such as running 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons on a single chip), and enhances AI methodologies using biologically realistic neurons for noise robustness and improved temporal processing.

Conclusion: BrainFuse acts as a unifying engine that bridges neuroscience and AI, promoting advanced bio-inspired intelligent system development and facilitating cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: RLME allows reinforcement learning of language models without relying on task-specific labels by utilizing natural-language meta-evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs face scalability issues due to reliance on ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, which can be ambiguous or costly.

Method: The paper proposes RLME, which uses evaluations from meta-questions in natural language (e.g., correctness or logical consistency) as reward signals. It updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization.

Result: RLME achieves comparable sample efficiency and accuracy to label-based methods, supports multiple objective trade-offs, promotes logical reasoning patterns, and generalizes to open-domain tasks without labels.

Conclusion: RLME broadens the application scope of RL for LLMs by enabling training in settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, improving scalability and adaptability.

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.

TL;DR: NEXUS ensures exact equivalent accuracy between ANNs and SNNs by reformulating operations using IF neuron logic gates, eliminating approximation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNN approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes, hindering their efficiency and wider application.

Method: Develops a framework utilizing spatial bit encoding, neuromorphic gate circuits, and surrogate-free STE training, ensuring equivalence to ANN outputs.

Result: Demonstrates ANN-equivalent accuracy with no performance degradation while achieving massive energy savings (27-168,000× reduction).

Conclusion: NEXUS enables energy-efficient SNNs with mathematically precise outputs, overcoming errors related to membrane potential leakage and synaptic noise.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100\% accuracy across all decay factors $β\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $σ=0.2$ with >98\% gate-level accuracy.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: ABOM introduces an adaptive parameter learning mechanism for black-box optimization tasks, eliminating the need for handcrafted training tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafted optimizers are inefficient for complex black-box optimization tasks, and existing meta-learning methods rely heavily on predefined training tasks.

Method: ABOM uses online parameter adaptation and a closed-loop adaptive learning mechanism that directly learns from the target task’s optimization data.

Result: ABOM achieves competitive results on both synthetic benchmarks and real UAV path planning problems, without relying on handcrafted training tasks.

Conclusion: Closed-loop parameter learning and adaptation make ABOM versatile and capable of tackling unknown task distributions effectively.

Abstract: Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism to improve Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for continuous control tasks by addressing error amplification during ANN-to-SNN conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from scratch for reinforcement learning is costly and unsafe. While converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is a practical alternative, conversion in continuous control tasks faces performance challenges due to error amplification.

Method: The authors introduce Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight mechanism to retain residual membrane potentials across decision steps, reducing temporally correlated errors.

Result: Experiments show that CRPI effectively improves performance in continuous control benchmarks and integrates smoothly into ANN-to-SNN conversion pipelines.

Conclusion: Continuous control presents challenges for ANN-to-SNN conversion. CRPI addresses these challenges by mitigating error amplification, highlighting its effectiveness in improving performance for SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

Motivation: To address training challenges in SNNs caused by spike non-differentiability and to incorporate predictive coding principles inspired by brain mechanisms.

Method: A spiking neuron design that generates an internal prediction current from input-output history to modulate membrane potential for improved training and performance.

Result: The approach demonstrated consistent performance improvements across various architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances SNN accuracy, training stability, and biological alignment, offering broad applicability for energy-efficient neural networks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early human-crafted BBO benchmarks have limitations like expert bias and lack of diversity. Automating the process can overcome these issues, ensuring enhanced objectivity and diversity.

Method: The paper introduces Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), which uses a large language model (LLM) for program evolution. The method formulates benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem, focusing on landscape diversity and the differentiation capability of BBO solvers.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that EoB is effective across various applications: benchmarking algorithms, aiding training/testing of learning-assisted BBO algorithms, and serving as proxies for real-world problems.

Conclusion: EoB is a competitive and versatile tool for designing objective and diverse BBO benchmarks and has potential uses in training and evaluating optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

### [255] [Adaptive Surrogate-Based Strategy for Accelerating Convergence Speed when Solving Expensive Unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21885)
*Tiwonge Msulira Banda,Alexandru-Ciprian Zăvoianu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents an adaptive surrogate modelling approach to enhance the early-stage performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) using machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of MOEAs in computationally expensive industrial problems by accelerating their convergence speed, saving time and resources.

Method: A two-loop architecture is proposed, integrating ML-driven surrogate models in an Adaptive Accelerator within MOEAs like NSGA-II and MOEA/D to approximate fitness functions.

Result: Integrated with benchmarks and a real-world case, the approach employing Gaussian Process Regression, Conv1D-NNs, and Random Forest Regression significantly improved early-stage optimisation speed of MOEAs.

Conclusion: The adaptive surrogate modelling method effectively accelerates MOEAs, making them more efficient for computationally intensive tasks.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.

*Kirill Antonov,Teus Tukker,Tiago Botari,Thomas H. W. Bäck,Anna V. Kononova,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDG-EA, a novel two-stage framework for optimizing optical lens designs, yielding diverse high-quality solutions within practical computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional optical lens design often results in convergence to a single local optimum, neglecting other viable solutions crucial for downstream engineering.

Method: LDG-EA partitions the design space using behavior descriptors, utilizes a probabilistic model for region allocation, and employs sophisticated local search techniques to explore distinct minima.

Result: LDG-EA generated 14500 candidate minima across 636 unique descriptors, significantly outperforming a CMA-ES baseline while operating within one-hour computational constraints.

Conclusion: LDG-EA enhances solution diversity and maintains competitive quality, demonstrating its capability for practical lens design applications.

Abstract: Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.

Conclusion: This approach enhances accuracy in roadmap updates for dynamic environments while maintaining efficiency, aiding effective robot motion planning.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

### [260] [Track-centric Iterative Learning for Global Trajectory Optimization in Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21027)
*Youngim Nam,Jungbin Kim,Kyungtae Kang,Cheolhyeon Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to optimize lap time in autonomous racing by iteratively refining and learning trajectories using uncertain vehicle dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing work that focuses on dynamics learning only at the tracking level, ignoring the need to update the global trajectory under uncertain vehicle dynamics for improved racing performance.

Method: A global trajectory optimization framework is proposed, using a track-centric approach with wavelet transform for representation, Bayesian optimization for efficient exploration, and an iterative learning framework to refine both dynamics and trajectory.

Result: The proposed framework improved lap times by up to 20.7% in simulations and real-world experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a significant enhancement in lap time optimization for autonomous racing by effectively integrating trajectory updates with learned vehicle dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

Conclusion: InspecSafe-V1 addresses the critical need for robust multimodal datasets in predictive maintenance and safety assessment, supporting advanced AI model development in industrial environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles.

For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a disturbance-aware control framework for robotic blimps using moving mass actuation to enhance stability under wind disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic blimps are highly susceptible to wind disturbances, requiring enhanced control strategies to ensure stable operation in such conditions.

Method: The approach combines a moving horizon estimator (MHE) that detects wind perturbations and a model predictive controller (MPC) for robust trajectory and heading regulation. A two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism is used for attitude and heading control.

Result: The framework was tested through extensive experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions, showing it significantly outperforms baseline PID control.

Conclusion: The proposed disturbance-aware control framework effectively stabilizes robotic blimps in challenging wind conditions, advancing LTA system operation.

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies and limitations of current fragmented, task-specific synthetic data pipelines that hinder generalization and scalability for embodied intelligence.

Method: Nimbus employs a modular four-layer architecture with decoupled execution to streamline trajectory planning, rendering, and storage. It uses dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and rendering optimizations.

Result: Nimbus achieves 2-3X throughput improvement compared to baseline systems while ensuring reliable operation in distributed, large-scale environments.

Conclusion: Nimbus provides a scalable, efficient, and robust framework, supporting high-output, cross-domain synthetic data generation for embodied intelligence foundational models.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in scaling diffusion-based policies for multi-task robot manipulation, specifically the high cost of model size and demonstrations.

Method: The authors introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a policy combining compact skill bases, sticky routing, variational training objectives, and adaptive expert activation at inference for efficient multi-task manipulation.

Result: SMP demonstrated superior simulation and real-world performance, achieving higher success rates and lower inference costs compared to large diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: SMP offers an efficient approach to multi-task robot manipulation by enabling scalable and transferable skill use, activating relevant subsets of experts as required, and adapting to task changes effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Result: The method demonstrated reduced failures, faster learning, and higher returns across diverse dynamical systems and reinforcement learning tasks compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Deep QP Safety Filter offers a practical and principled safe control for model-free systems while improving learning outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents HPTune, a hierarchical proactive tuning framework, to improve parameter updates in MPC motion planners, showcased to outperform baseline methods in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter tuning methods are inefficient due to their myopic approach of evaluating only executed actions and the sparseness of failure events like collisions.

Method: Proposes HPTune, which uses hierarchical tuning with fast-level risk indicators and a slow-level extended evaluation loss with closed-loop backpropagation. Doppler LiDAR is integrated to further enhance motion predictions.

Result: Extensive simulations demonstrate HPTune’s ability to efficiently tune MPC and outperform baseline methods in ensuring efficient motion planning in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: HPTune offers a situation-aware motion planning strategy, effectively enabling safer and more agile collision avoidance.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach to improve humanoid control in RL using pretraining with off-policy SAC and efficient adaptation using model-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the efficiency gap between large-scale pretraining and finetuning of humanoid RL policies, along with the limitations of low sample efficiency in on-policy algorithms.

Method: The method combines off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for large-scale pretraining with deterministic data collection and model-based methods for safe and efficient adaptation to new tasks.

Result: This approach achieves zero-shot deployment of humanoid locomotion policies on real robots and efficient adaptation in new or out-of-distribution environments.

Conclusion: The work integrates the scalability of off-policy SAC pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based methods for safe and effective humanoid control in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many current robotic systems fail to generalize well due to challenges like high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and carefully curated training scenarios. Grasping in space presents a particularly challenging and representative problem to address these limitations.

Method: The authors incorporate a learned latent manifold that combines multiple modalities into a structured representation. They employ GPU-accelerated simulation and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning to train grasping policies.

Result: The proposed approach achieves over 95% success in under 1M environment steps under variable grasping conditions. It surpasses visual baseline methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness to novel objects and gripper geometries.

Conclusion: Reasoning in latent space leads to more sample-efficient and robust learning. The research identifies remaining limitations and outlines future work toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in extreme environments like space.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

*Weitao An,Qi Liu,Chenghao Xu,Jiayi Chai,Xu Yang,Kun Wei,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DSCD-Nav, a new navigation system for robots. It uses dual stances to improve decision-making under partial observability, reducing errors and exploration redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in indoor robot navigation, particularly overconfident errors and redundant exploration seen in current models.

Method: Proposes DSCD-Nav, which uses two stances (Task-Scene Understanding and Safety-Information Balancing) to cooperatively debate and refine decisions.

Result: Experiments on various datasets (HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, MP3D) show improved success rates, efficiency, and reduced redundant exploration.

Conclusion: DSCD-Nav provides more reliable navigation in challenging environments, balancing goal progress with safety and information awareness.

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

### [272] [Singularity-Free Lie Group Integration and Geometrically Consistent Evaluation of Multibody System Models Described in Terms of Standard Absolute Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21413)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework enabling integration of Lie group integration methods with standard equations of motion (EOM) formulations, resolving incompatibility challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of singularity-free time integration in multibody system (MBS) modeling by combining Lie group integration methods with traditional equations of motion (EOM) formulations.

Method: Introduced a framework providing an interface between Lie group integrators and standard EOM formulations, leveraging direct and semidirect product groups (SO(3)xR3 and SE(3)) and a local-global transitions (LGT) map to ensure consistent updates in multibody modeling.

Result: Showed that the proposed method allows using Lie group integration schemes within standard MBS simulation codes without major restructuring, preserving the geometry of rigid body motions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively resolves the incompatibility between Lie group integration and conventional EOM setups, enabling geometry-respecting integration in MBS models.

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

### [273] [Spotlighting Task-Relevant Features: Object-Centric Representations for Better Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21416)
*Alexandre Chapin,Bruno Machado,Emmanuel Dellandréa,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates slot-based object-centric representations (SBOCR) as an intermediate visual representation for robotic manipulation tasks, revealing improved generalization over traditional dense and global representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses poor generalization in robotic manipulation policies caused by task-irrelevant information in traditional visual representations (global and dense features) under visual distribution shifts, such as lighting and texture variations or distractors.

Method: The authors propose the use of SBOCR, which organizes visual information into object-like entities, reducing irrelevant data. They benchmark this approach against dense and global representations in simulated and real-world tasks with varying visual conditions.

Result: SBOCR-based policies demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to dense and global representation-based policies across different scenarios, even without task-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: Slot-based object-centric representations (SBOCR) hold promise for enhancing robotic manipulation systems' performance and adaptability in dynamic and uncertain visual environments.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4D-CAAL, a framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and automatic labeling, providing a dual-purpose calibration target and automated annotation transfer pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to integrate 4D radar with cameras for autonomous driving, which requires accurate calibration and annotated datasets. Current methods complicate correspondence establishment or are labor-intensive in manual labeling.

Method: A dual-purpose calibration target combining a checkerboard for cameras and a corner reflector for radar is proposed. The corresponding matching algorithm aligns these features, and an auto-labeling pipeline transfers annotations for radar data using calibrated sensor relationships.

Result: The proposed method achieves high calibration accuracy and reduces manual annotation effort, demonstrating effectiveness in labeled data generation.

Conclusion: 4D-CAAL simplifies radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling, accelerating multi-modal perception development for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: DexTac is a learning framework that uses multi-dimensional tactile data from human demonstrations, enabling dexterous robotic hands to perform complex contact-intensive tasks, with a 91.67% success rate in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of low-dimensional tactile information in existing dexterous manipulation systems and to enable comprehensive, tactile-aware robotic motions in contact-intensive tasks.

Method: DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data from human demonstrations, integrating contact force distributions and spatial contact regions into a policy network to enable autonomous contact-aware manipulation.

Result: DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate on a challenging unimanual injection task, outperforming force-only baselines by 31.67% in high-precision scenarios.

Conclusion: Learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations enhances robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

*Anna Rothenhäusler,Markus Mazzola,Andreas Look,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Bödecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces MatchInformer to tackle the issue of occluded traffic agents for autonomous vehicles, reducing prediction redundancy and improving trajectory forecasting using a transformer-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in autonomous driving caused by occluded agents, where hidden pedestrians or vehicles can lead to sudden disruptions and inefficiencies.

Method: MatchInformer integrates a transformer-based approach with Hungarian Matching to ensure one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth while refining trajectories and using MCC for robust evaluations.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate improved reasoning about occlusions and more precise trajectory predictions.

Conclusion: MatchInformer effectively reduces prediction redundancy, enhances interpretability, and advances the field of reasoning about occluded regions in autonomous vehicle applications.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces IROS, a real-time robot navigation framework blending fast decision-making with advanced semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack a balance between responsive navigation and robust semantic understanding in indoor settings.

Method: IROS uses a Dual Process Theory-inspired framework, integrating lightweight perceptual modules with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) selectively invoked for complex reasoning.

Result: Tests in five real-world buildings show IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: IROS successfully enables real-time, human-like navigation by efficiently combining lightweight and advanced reasoning models.

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

Abstract: Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

Motivation: VLA models have shown great potential in ground systems, but their application to aerial systems remains underexplored due to distinct challenges like floating-base dynamics, UAV-manipulator coupling, and complex task requirements.

Method: The authors developed AIR-VLA, a physics-based simulation environment and dataset with 3000 teleoperated demonstrations, aiming to evaluate current VLA and vision-language models for aerial systems.

Result: The study demonstrated the successful adaptation of VLA paradigms to aerial systems and provided multi-dimensional metrics to examine UAV mobility, manipulator control, and planning capabilities. It also revealed existing model limitations.

Conclusion: AIR-VLA sets a benchmark for aerial manipulation systems, offering a foundation for research in aerial robotics by addressing obstacles related to the unique dynamics and semantics of UAV-based systems.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces sound-triggered mobile manipulation, enabling agents to react to auditory events in their environment without specific instructions, supported by a new platform, Habitat-Echo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome limitations in current mobile manipulation paradigms, which confine agents to passive roles that rely solely on predefined textual instructions, thus lacking autonomy to adapt to dynamic environments.

Method: The study develops 'Habitat-Echo,' a data platform combining acoustic rendering and physical interaction, along with a baseline system featuring a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to enable sound-triggered manipulation tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the baseline enables agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, successfully isolating sound sources and performing actions even in complex scenarios like dual-source interference.

Conclusion: This approach allows agents to autonomously engage with their surroundings, showcasing the potential of sound-triggered mobile manipulation for achieving dynamic and robust interaction without manual instructions.

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

Conclusion: The CoFreeVLA approach demonstrates enhanced safety and effectiveness for dual-arm manipulation tasks, advancing practical deployment of VLA models.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions.

TL;DR: This study addresses challenges in robotic cloth manipulation by exploring an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) approach that optimizes model size and training time while yielding significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic cloth manipulation faces challenges like high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and self-occlusion. The reliance on data-heavy, computationally expensive methods motivates the need for more efficient RL approaches.

Method: The paper adopts careful design principles in RL, reducing model size and training time in simulation. It also explores efficient sim-to-real transfer for real-world applicability.

Result: Their method achieves significant performance improvements on the SoftGym benchmark task with a smaller RL model compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Efficient and modular RL designs can overcome computational inefficiencies and improve performance in cloth manipulation tasks, offering practical implications for robotics.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Conclusion: This dataset enables algorithm development for mental workload estimation and sheds light on how environmental factors influence workload markers in industrial settings.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid planners struggle with reliable mode transitions and efficient driving in dense traffic due to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency updates.

Method: Utilizes large language models for scene understanding, integrates its inference into joint optimization combining mode configuration and motion planning using tree-search model predictive control.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate LAP's superiority in driving time and success rate compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAP effectively reconciles high-speed efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense environments, offering significant improvements in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the multi-module MANTA-RAY platform for scalable manipulation surfaces using reduced actuator density, capable of handling diverse objects and enabling coordinated manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in scalable manipulation surfaces that rely on dense actuator arrays, which increase complexity and limit usability for fragile and heterogeneous objects.

Method: A modular, scalable platform (multi-module MANTA-RAY) uses a fabric-based surface and geometric PID controller for object manipulation, avoiding complex training methods. Performance is tested via simulations and physical prototypes.

Result: The system effectively manipulated various objects, including fragile and textured ones, and demonstrated scalability with coordinated manipulation across larger areas.

Conclusion: The multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability, simplifies control complexity, and supports practical applications for manipulating fragile and diverse objects.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper improves diffusion-based visuomotor policies by addressing the issue of task-irrelevant noise, introducing a Variational Regularization (VR) module that boosts performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancies and noise in intermediate feature blocks of diffusion-based visuomotor policies, which degrade the performance of robotic skill learning.

Method: Proposes Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that applies a timestep-conditioned Gaussian and a KL-divergence regularizer over backbone features, creating an adaptive information bottleneck.

Result: The proposed VR module improves success rates on three benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) by up to 6.1%, achieving state-of-the-art performance, with additional validation in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features can be effectively addressed by VR, leading to significant performance improvements in diffusion-based visuomotor policies for robotic skills.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for surgical manipulation tasks that boosts performance and robustness using minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in surgical robotics, such as data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and high safety requirements, by improving learning methods for robotic surgical manipulation.

Method: The method involves enhancing the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) with a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, enabling it to learn from stereo endoscopic images and fewer demonstrations.

Result: The method outperforms Vision-Language-Action models and standard ACT, showing higher success rates, better robustness to challenging conditions, and generalization to unseen scenarios and ex vivo porcine tissue.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE architecture demonstrates promising advancement toward in vivo deployment of surgical robots by enhancing task learning, generalization, and robustness.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a foldable, macro-scale origami rotary motor capable of continuous rotary motion, using corona discharge for torque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of macro-scale folding continuous rotary actuators in the field of foldable robotics.

Method: The researchers developed a prototype origami rotary motor that unfolds for operation, using corona discharge to generate torque. Key performance metrics were measured during testing.

Result: The motor achieved a 2.5:1 expansion ratio, a top speed of 1440 rpm at -29 kV, and a torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg with a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the first macro-scale origami rotary motor, providing valuable insights for future foldable robotics and actuator designs.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PocketDP3, a compact 3D diffusion policy for robotic manipulation reducing model size and inference time through the use of a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency caused by an architectural mismatch in 3D vision-based diffusion policies, where compact scene representations are often paired with unnecessarily large decoders.

Method: Replaces the traditional heavy conditional U-Net decoder with a lightweight MLP-Mixer-based Diffusion Mixer for efficient temporal and channel dimension fusion.

Result: PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of previous methods across benchmarks, with faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: PocketDP3 offers a practical and scalable solution for real-time robotic manipulation while maintaining high performance and demonstrating real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to adapt pre-trained surface electromyography (sEMG) models from healthy individuals to stroke patients, improving intent detection with less calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve intent detection for paretic muscles in post-stroke rehabilitation, addressing issues of calibration burden and variability.

Method: A healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline is developed where a pretrained model on able-bodied sEMG is fine-tuned using small datasets from stroke patients, employing strategies like head-only tuning, LoRA adapters, and end-to-end fine-tuning.

Result: The best adaptation methods improved transition and raw accuracy significantly for stroke patients, exceeding traditional stroke-only training under the same data conditions.

Conclusion: Pre-trained healthy-domain EMG models can enhance intent detection for post-stroke rehabilitation by reducing calibration time and improving robustness to variability.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynamicVLA, a framework designed to improve vision-language-action models in dynamic object manipulation tasks by incorporating temporal reasoning and real-time adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models excel in static object manipulation but fall short in dynamic scenarios that demand quick perception, temporal planning, and continuous actions.

Method: DynamicVLA uses a compact VLA model with convolutional encoder, Continuous Inference for simultaneous reasoning and execution, and Latent-aware Action Streaming for precise temporal alignment. A new Dynamic Object Manipulation benchmark was also created to support the approach with both synthetic and real-world data.

Result: DynamicVLA demonstrates significant advancements in response speed, perception quality, and generalization ability for dynamic object manipulation tasks, based on extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The study positions DynamicVLA as an effective, unified solution for handling general dynamic object manipulation across diverse settings and embodiments.

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the impact of large language models (LLMs) on software systems' maintainability and evolvability, exploring their benefits, risks, and mitigation strategies through a systematic literature review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how large language models impact the maintainability and evolvability of software systems and address the fragmented evidence surrounding their effects.

Method: A systematic literature review across prominent databases, identifying 87 primary studies from 2020 to 2024, analyzing attributes descriptively, synthesizing impacts and risks using a hybrid thematic approach, and employing LLM-assisted tools with human validation.

Result: LLMs enhance software systems' analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging, and repair but pose risks such as hallucinated outputs, brittleness, flawed evaluations, and unstable performance.

Conclusion: LLMs have both benefits and risks for long-term software sustainability; their responsible use requires safeguards, thorough evaluations, and structured oversight.

Abstract: Context. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability. Responsible adoption requires safeguards, rigorous evaluation, and structured human oversight.

TL;DR: DevOps-Gym is introduced as the first benchmark for assessing AI agents' performance in the full software DevOps cycle. This reveals current AI struggles with crucial DevOps tasks like issue resolving, monitoring, and test generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's success in code generation and issue resolution, its effectiveness in the complete DevOps cycle—involving dynamic behaviors and large projects—remains unknown, requiring thorough evaluation tools.

Method: The authors propose DevOps-Gym, integrating 700+ tasks sourced from over 30 Java and Go projects, alongside a semi-automated data collection mechanism with expert input for quality assurance.

Result: State-of-the-art AI models exhibit significant limitations in handling key DevOps tasks, especially in issue resolution, monitoring, and build processes.

Conclusion: Further research is critical for advancing AI capabilities across the entire DevOps lifecycle, as current models cannot meet the complex challenges presented by real-world projects.

Abstract: Even though demonstrating extraordinary capabilities in code generation and software issue resolving, AI agents' capabilities in the full software DevOps cycle are still unknown. Different from pure code generation, handling the DevOps cycle in real-world software, including developing, deploying, and managing, requires analyzing large-scale projects, understanding dynamic program behaviors, leveraging domain-specific tools, and making sequential decisions. However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated problems and lack environments and tool interfaces for DevOps. We introduce DevOps-Gym, the first end-to-end benchmark for evaluating AI agents across core DevOps workflows: build and configuration, monitoring, issue resolving, and test generation. DevOps-Gym includes 700+ real-world tasks collected from 30+ projects in Java and Go. We develop a semi-automated data collection mechanism with rigorous and non-trivial expert efforts in ensuring the task coverage and quality. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models and agents reveals fundamental limitations: they struggle with issue resolving and test generation in Java and Go, and remain unable to handle new tasks such as monitoring and build and configuration. These results highlight the need for essential research in automating the full DevOps cycle with AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for evaluating AI IDE agents as true engineering collaborators through realistic, structured, and diverse software engineering tasks.

Method: It introduces a Dockerized test harness enabling high-level abstractions for codebase search, file editing, and task evaluation within a structured environment using 80 tasks across various repositories and tech stacks.

Result: IDE-Bench evaluates the correlation between agent-reported intent and successful modifications, providing a practical benchmark for AI IDE agent capabilities in uncontaminated environments.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a standardized and realistic method to assess AI IDE agents, emphasizing their performance in private, diverse, and real-world software engineering tasks.

Abstract: IDE-Bench is a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI IDE agents on real-world software engineering tasks through an IDE-native tool interface. We present a Dockerized test harness that goes beyond raw terminal execution, granting models a structured tool ecosystem that represents AI-native IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. By providing high-level abstractions for codebase search, structured file editing, and tools for testing full-stack applications, IDE-Bench evaluates an agent's ability to act as a true engineering collaborator. For evaluation and to prevent training data contamination, we created 80 tasks across eight never-published repositories spanning C/C++, Java, and MERN stacks, representing modern tech stack production scenarios, including feature implementation, bug fixing, refactoring, and performance optimization that mirror daily developer workflows in private codebases. Our benchmark is the first to systematically correlate agent-reported intent with successful project-level modifications in a multi-language, full-stack environment on completely uncontaminated code.

*Henry Edison,Nauman Ali*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the problem of repetitive and overlapping systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in software engineering, specifically in effort estimation in Agile software development, identifying common justification patterns for additional SLRs and suggesting improvements to reduce duplication and enhance progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the concerning issue of increased repetitive and overlapping systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in software engineering, which can lead to inefficiencies and hinder progress in research.

Method: The paper analyzes 18 published SLRs on effort estimation in Agile software development using qualitative content analysis. It examines common justification patterns, citation data, publication years, venues, and the quality of studies.

Result: Authors of SLRs commonly justify their work citing gaps in coverage, previous methodological limitations, outdated studies, or fast-paced advancements in technologies and methods requiring updates.

Conclusion: Insights from this analysis emphasize the need for robust guidelines and policies for identifying existing SLRs and justifying new ones, aiming to minimize duplication and foster effective progress in research within software engineering.

Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the manual effort and improve efficiency in generating metamodels for DDD, especially under resource constraints, by leveraging generative AI.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a consumer-grade GPU-trained, 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama using LoRA to generate domain-specific JSON objects. They trained the generative AI using real-world DDD datasets.

Result: The proposed AI model produced syntactically correct and accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing, achieving high performance despite constrained hardware resources.

Conclusion: Generative AI can be effectively integrated into the DDD process to automate metamodel generation, reducing resource demands and offering significant potential for more efficient software development workflows.

Abstract: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a key framework for developing customer-oriented software, focusing on the precise modeling of an application's domain. Traditionally, metamodels that describe these domains are created manually by system designers, forming the basis for iterative software development. This paper explores the partial automation of metamodel generation using generative AI, particularly for producing domain-specific JSON objects. By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Despite limited hardware, the model achieved high performance, generating accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing. This research illustrates the viability of incorporating generative AI into the DDD process, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements, while also laying the groundwork for further advancements in AI-driven software development.

Abstract: Context: Blockchain and AI are increasingly explored to enhance trustworthiness in software engineering (SE), particularly in supporting software evolution tasks. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges. Future work must develop measurable, reproducible trust frameworks to enable reliable, secure, and compliant AI-driven SE ecosystems, including applications involving large language models.

TL;DR: The paper presents a taxonomy for "research software" in the research software supply chain (RSSC), harmonizing definitions and facilitating security studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by inconsistencies in defining "research software" across empirical studies, particularly due to the security risks in the research software supply chain (RSSC).

Method: The authors create a taxonomy based on a scoping review of repository mining studies to harmonize prior approaches. They operationalize it via an annotated dataset derived from the Research Software Encyclopedia (RSE) and evaluate it using the OpenSSF Scorecard for preliminary security insights.

Result: The taxonomy successfully harmonizes inconsistent definitions, producing a dataset and pipeline that facilitate taxonomy-aware security stratification and analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that taxonomy-aware approaches improve the interpretation of RSSC security studies, providing clearer, more actionable insights into repository security risks.

Abstract: Empirical studies of research software are hard to compare because the literature operationalizes ``research software'' inconsistently. Motivated by the research software supply chain (RSSC) and its security risks, we introduce an RSSC-oriented taxonomy that makes scope and operational boundaries explicit for empirical research software security studies.
  We conduct a targeted scoping review of recent repository mining and dataset construction studies, extracting each work's definition, inclusion criteria, unit of analysis, and identification heuristics. We synthesize these into a harmonized taxonomy and a mapping that translates prior approaches into shared taxonomy dimensions. We operationalize the taxonomy on a large community-curated corpus from the Research Software Encyclopedia (RSE), producing an annotated dataset, a labeling codebook, and a reproducible labeling pipeline. Finally, we apply OpenSSF Scorecard as a preliminary security analysis to show how repository-centric security signals differ across taxonomy-defined clusters and why taxonomy-aware stratification is necessary for interpreting RSSC security measurements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations in current benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) for code, introducing a new framework called BEHELM to address these shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in existing benchmarks for code-focused LLMs, which fail to robustly evaluate critical dimensions like robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability.

Method: Conducted a survey of existing benchmarks and community workshops, identifying three main barriers and developing BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure with a multi-metric evaluation framework.

Result: BEHELM enables structured, fair, and reproducible evaluation of LLMs across software engineering tasks and quality dimensions, reducing the effort needed to create robust benchmarks.

Conclusion: BEHELM provides a more comprehensive and standardized way to evaluate LLMs, promoting fair and effective benchmarking for software engineering applications.

Abstract: Large language models for code are advancing fast, yet our ability to evaluate them lags behind. Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation. BEHELM provides a structured way to assess models across tasks, languages, input and output granularities, and key quality dimensions. Our goal is to reduce the overhead currently required to construct benchmarks while enabling a fair, realistic, and future-proof assessment of LLMs in software engineering.

*S M Mahedy Hasan,Md Fazle Rabbi,Minhaz Zibran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates 'silent' AI-generated pull requests (SPRs) with no accompanying comments, analyzing their acceptance or rejection rationales using project data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating the acceptance or rejection of silent AI-generated pull requests when no comments or discussions are available.

Method: The authors conduct a quantitative study of 4,762 silent AI pull requests (SPRs) from Python repositories using the AIDev dataset. They examine the impact of SPRs on code complexity, quality issues, and security vulnerabilities.

Result: The study identifies patterns and possible insights related to quality issues, code complexity, and security vulnerabilities that might influence the acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

Conclusion: Understanding the contributing factors of SPRs’ acceptance or rejection provides valuable insights into automated software contributions.

Abstract: We present the first empirical study of AI-generated pull requests that are 'silent,' meaning no comments or discussions accompany them. This absence of any comments or discussions associated with such silent AI pull requests (SPRs) poses a unique challenge in understanding the rationale for their acceptance or rejection. Hence, we quantitatively study 4,762 SPRs of five AI agents made to popular Python repositories drawn from the AIDev public dataset. We examine SPRs impact on code complexity, other quality issues, and security vulnerabilities, especially to determine whether these insights can hint at the rationale for acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

### [303] [AI-Assisted Engineering Should Track the Epistemic Status and Temporal Validity of Architectural Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116)
*Sankalp Gilda,Shlok Gilda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper highlights the need for robust mechanisms in AI-assisted software engineering to track the reliability and validity of architectural decisions over time. The authors propose a framework to ensure temporal accountability and prevent trust inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge that LLM coding assistants rapidly generate architectural decisions, but teams lack systematic frameworks to distinguish between conjecture and verified knowledge, ensure evidence reliability, or detect outdated evidence.

Method: The authors propose the 'First Principles Framework' (FPF) which includes epistemic layers to separate hypotheses from validated claims, conservative evidence aggregation grounded in fuzzy logic norms, and tracking of evidence decay over time. They define five invariants for valid aggregation operators.

Result: An audit using FPF on two internal projects revealed that 20-25% of architectural decisions were based on outdated evidence within two months, emphasizing the importance of ensuring temporal validity in AI-assisted workflows.

Conclusion: The FPF framework provides a structured way to handle epistemic challenges in AI-assisted software engineering, with potential to enhance accuracy and accountability. Further research into learnable aggregation and federated evidence sharing is suggested.

Abstract: This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.

*TianYi Tang,Saba Alimadadi,Nick Sumner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes bug types in TypeScript projects, finding that faults are mostly related to tooling, configuration, and API misuses rather than logic or syntax errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of TypeScript on software faults by studying bug types in real-world projects.

Method: Analyzed 633 bug reports from 16 open-source repositories to create a taxonomy, quantify fault types, and relate them to project characteristics.

Result: Identified major fault types as tooling/configuration issues, API misuses, and asynchronous errors, which correlate with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Static typing in TypeScript reduces runtime/type errors but shifts fault fragility to integration areas like build systems and toolchains.

Abstract: TypeScript has rapidly become a popular language for modern web development, yet its effect on software faults remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems.

*Roberto Milanese,Francesco Salzano,Angelica Spina,Antonio Vitale,Remo Pareschi,Fausto Fasano,Mattia Fazzini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies human-agent-produced pull requests (HAPRs) and compares them with human pull requests (HPRs), focusing on testing practices and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand how human-AI collaboration impacts testing in software development, as it is an area with limited research despite its adoption in workflows.

Method: An empirical study of 6,582 HAPRs and 3,122 HPRs, analyzing testing frequency, extent, types of testing-related changes, and quality using the AIDev dataset.

Result: HAPRs show greater testing extent with a higher test-to-source code ratio, while prioritizing adding new tests in co-evolution tasks. The inclusion likelihood and test quality differences between HAPRs and HPRs are minor.

Conclusion: This study offers insights into human-AI collaboration's role in software testing, finding that while HAPRs improve testing extent, test quality remains similar to HPRs.

Abstract: AI-based coding agents are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, collaborating with developers to create pull requests (PRs). Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality. These insights provide the first characterization of how human-agent collaboration shapes testing practices.

*Wei Minn,Biniam Fisseha Demissie,Yan Naing Tun,Jiakun Liu,Mariano Ceccato,Lwin Khin Shar,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CovAgent, an AI-powered framework, improves Android app GUI testing coverage significantly compared to leading methods by identifying and satisfying conditions for hard-to-reach activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of low activity coverage in Android app UI testing, where state-of-the-art techniques often fail to surpass 30% coverage in real-world apps due to complex user inputs, device configurations, and inaccessible code paths.

Method: The authors developed CovAgent, which includes an AI agent to identify unsatisfied activation conditions in app code and another agent to generate scripts that satisfy these conditions, improving GUI testing coverage through dynamic instrumentation.

Result: CovAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods like LLMDroid, Fastbot, and APE, achieving up to 179.7% higher activity coverage and excelling in other coverage metrics such as class, method, and line coverage.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CovAgent significantly enhances UI testing for Android apps, validating the utility of Agentic AI in overcoming limitations of traditional fuzzers and achieving greater test coverage.

Abstract: Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.

*Sayma Sultana,London Cavaletto,Bianca Trinkenreich,Amiangshu Bosu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines workplace bias among software engineers using Social Identity Theory (SIT), identifying four main types of bias and various demographic impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the knowledge gap regarding specific impacts of workplace bias on software engineers and contribute insights to an understudied field.

Method: A vignette-based survey was used to quantify bias prevalence, identify affected demographics, assess consequences, and explore motivations.

Result: Career development and task selection biases are most prevalent, especially among women and marginalized ethnic groups. Various demographic factors are predictors of bias victimization.

Conclusion: Workplace biases are pervasive and diverse, necessitating targeted policies to address the challenges faced by underrepresented groups.

Abstract: While systemic workplace bias is well-documented in non-computing fields, its specific impact on software engineers remains poorly understood. This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization.

### [308] [More Code, Less Reuse: Investigating Code Quality and Reviewer Sentiment towards AI-generated Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21276)
*Haoming Huang,Pongchai Jaisri,Shota Shimizu,Lingfeng Chen,Sota Nakashima,Gema Rodríguez-Pérez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the impacts and characteristics of pull requests (PRs) generated by LLM Agents beyond the typical pass rate, finding that LLMs often overlook code reuse, leading to redundancy, yet receive positive feedback from reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the broader implications of LLM-generated pull requests beyond pass rates, including maintainability, readability, and developers' intuitive evaluations, addressing current gaps in evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors analyzed code quality, maintainability, and emotional reactions to LLM-generated and human-generated pull requests using code metrics and sentiment evaluations.

Result: LLM Agents showed higher redundancy due to missed code reuse opportunities, but they elicited more neutral or positive emotions from reviewers compared to human contributions. This mismatch can result in unnoticed technical debt accumulation.

Conclusion: While LLM Agents contribute to development efficiently, their tendency to bypass code reuse can degrade long-term code quality. Positive reviewer reactions to AI-generated PRs suggest the need for better evaluation and guidelines for effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are advancing quickly, with the increasing leveraging of LLM Agents to assist in development tasks such as code generation. While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments. Our research provides insights for improving human-AI collaboration.

### [309] [Detecting Multiple Semantic Concerns in Tangled Code Commits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21298)
*Beomsu Koh,Neil Walkinshaw,Donghwan Shin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates multi-concern detection for tangled commits using Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating competitive performance compared to Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance commit clarity in version control systems by addressing tangled commits involving multiple concerns, which complicate development and maintenance.

Method: The authors frame the problem as a multi-label classification task, constructing a dataset of artificially tangled commits and empirically evaluating SLMs with fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation.

Result: A fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM performs competitively with state-of-the-art LLMs for single-concern detection and remains effective for handling up to three concerns. Commit messages significantly improve accuracy.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively handle tangled commits and detect multiple semantic concerns, offering efficiency and privacy advantages over LLMs. Commit messages play a crucial role in improving detection accuracy.

Abstract: Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 147 professional developers' adoption and perceptions of generative AI tools in software development, uncovering a 'virtuous adoption cycle' leading to productivity and quality gains, while identifying three developer archetypes and barriers such as low AI testing tool adoption and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the perceptions and effects of generative AI tools in software development by understanding usage patterns, productivity and quality outcomes, and the dynamics of developer adoption.

Method: Empirical analysis of 147 software developers considering usage frequency, breadth of application, productivity, perceived quality improvements, and readiness to adopt AI tools using perceptual and statistical evaluation methods.

Result: Frequent and broad AI tool usage correlates strongly with perceived productivity and quality enhancements. Developers show increased intent to adopt with high current usage, but security and testing tool adoption gaps persist. Three archetypes of developers were identified, providing insights into innovation diffusion processes.

Conclusion: Generative AI tools' adoption supports productivity and quality improvements in software development. While Enthusiasts drive organizational success, Pragmatists follow, and Cautious developers lag due to lack of examples. Security concerns and testing gaps act as notable barriers to broader adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.

### [311] [Predicting Developer Acceptance of AI-Generated Code Suggestions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21379)
*Jing Jiang,Liehao Li,Jinyun Hou,Xin Tan,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions by developers using real-world data and proposes a model, CSAP, to predict suggestion acceptance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developer workflows are disrupted by undesired AI code suggestions, and there is a lack of quantitative research on why developers accept or reject these suggestions.

Method: An empirical study of 66,329 developer-AI interactions was conducted to identify factors influencing suggestion acceptance. A predictive model, CSAP, was introduced based on these findings.

Result: CSAP achieved high prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines, demonstrating effective filtering of unlikely-to-be-accepted code suggestions.

Conclusion: Personalized prediction of code suggestion acceptance can reduce interruptions for developers and improve AI-assisted programming tools.

Abstract: AI-assisted programming tools are widely adopted, yet their practical utility is often undermined by undesired suggestions that interrupt developer workflows and cause frustration. While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\% and 69.5\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\% and 140.1\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DebateCoder is a framework to enhance reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs) for code generation using collaborative multi-agent protocols and adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) face bottlenecks in reasoning and logic capabilities, especially in complex environments, and need a scalable approach for automation efficiency.

Method: DebateCoder employs three collaborative agents (User Agent, Technical Agent, and Quality Assurance Agent), adaptive gating for confidence, and multi-turn deliberation with debugging loops.

Result: DebateCoder demonstrates superior performance with 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming counterparts while reducing computational resource demands.

Conclusion: Collaborative multi-agent approaches, such as DebateCoder, enhance the reasoning capacity and efficiency of SLMs, enabling scalable solutions for automated programming tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed breakthroughs in automated code generation, Small Language Models (SLMs) often encounter reasoning bottlenecks and failure loops when addressing complex logical requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose DebateCoder, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to improve the reasoning ability of SLMs (e.g., Pangu-1B) in resource-constrained environments. DebateCoder uses a structured role-playing protocol with three agents: User Agent (A_UA), Technical Agent (A_TA), and Quality Assurance Agent (A_QA). It also includes an Adaptive Confidence Gating mechanism with a 95% threshold to balance accuracy and inference efficiency. In addition, we introduce a multi-turn deliberation module and a reviewer-guided analytical debugging loop for orthogonal pre-generation debate and post-generation refinement. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming MapCoder while reducing API overhead by about 35%. These results indicate that collaborative protocols can mitigate limitations of small-parameter models and provide a scalable, efficient approach to high-quality automated software engineering.

*Anubhab Ghosh,Ajay Nayak,Dhananjay Rao Thallikar Shyam,Arkaprava Basu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents SCuBA, a static analysis tool for GPU programs, addressing input-dependent and intra-allocation out-of-bound (OOB) memory access bugs that existing runtime tools fail to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Several memory safety bugs in GPU programs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB), compromise software security and go undetected with existing runtime tools, especially when these bugs are input-dependent or involve intra-allocation memory layouts.

Method: SCuBA is a compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to uncover semantic relations governing memory allocations and memory access offsets. It uses a SAT solver to verify potential OOB access for any input and examines partitioned memory structures to identify intra-allocation OOBs.

Result: SCuBA successfully detects elusive memory bugs in GPU programs, outperforming NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer by identifying 45 more memory bugs across 20 programs, with zero false alarms.

Conclusion: The paper establishes SCuBA as an effective and precise solution for detecting challenging memory safety issues in GPU programs, offering significant improvements over existing tools.

Abstract: Memory safety bugs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB) in GPU programs, can compromise the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.
  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.

*Adriana Novoa-Hurtado,Rubén Saborido,Francisco Chicano,Manuel Giménez-Medina*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective integer linear programming model to reduce cognitive complexity in software through an extract method refactoring approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to enhance software maintainability and reduce vulnerabilities by simplifying code comprehension and minimizing cognitive complexity.

Method: The authors model the extraction process as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model. They also develop various algorithms and integrate them into a tool for parameterized problem-solving.

Result: Their approach provides a set of solutions for reducing cognitive complexity and balancing lines of code, which were validated through the developed algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed model and tool offer an effective means to improve code comprehension and maintainability, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of software.

Abstract: Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.

Motivation: Address the need for detecting context-dependent bugs in RPC methods of blockchain clients, as existing solutions focus primarily on RPC method calls without considering context.

Method: EthCRAFT constructs states and transactions to create contexts and generates context-aware RPC calls; uses cross-referencing responses from five blockchain clients as oracles to identify bugs.

Result: EthCRAFT shows superior performance in detecting RPC bugs, discovers six new bugs in major Ethereum clients, and receives bounties and acknowledgments for its contributions.

Conclusion: EthCRAFT demonstrates its effectiveness in finding RPC bugs, emphasizing its significance as a reliable detection tool for blockchain client vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.
  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation.

*Shashiwadana Nirmania,Garima Sharma,Hourieh Khalajzadeh,Mojtaba Shahin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates age-based challenges in mobile app usage by analyzing app reviews, using qualitative methods and models like RoBERTa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile apps are widely used but often fail to address the distinct needs of users across age groups.

Method: A dataset of 4,163 Google Play Store reviews was analyzed, with machine learning, deep learning, and large language models detecting age-related concerns. RoBERTa had the highest precision.

Result: RoBERTa achieved 92.46% precision in detecting age-related discussions, and qualitative analysis identified six common themes of user concerns.

Conclusion: Improving age inclusivity in app development requires a deeper understanding of age-related user concerns, as highlighted in this study.

Abstract: In recent years, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for managing various aspects of life. From enhancing productivity to providing personalized entertainment, mobile apps have revolutionized people's daily routines. Despite this rapid growth and popularity, gaps remain in how these apps address the needs of users from different age groups. Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to older users having difficulty with usability due to age-related vision and cognition impairments. Although there have been initiatives to create age-inclusive apps, a limited understanding of user perspectives on age-related issues may hinder developers from recognizing specific challenges and implementing effective solutions. In this study, we explore age discussions in app reviews to gain insights into how mobile apps should cater to users across different age groups.We manually curated a dataset of 4,163 app reviews from the Google Play Store and identified 1,429 age-related reviews and 2,734 non-age-related reviews. We employed eight machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to automatically detect age discussions, with RoBERTa performing the best, achieving a precision of 92.46%. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the 1,429 age-related reviews uncovers six dominant themes reflecting user concerns.

### [317] [AtPatch: Debugging Transformers via Hot-Fixing Over-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21695)
*Shihao Weng,Yang Feng,Jincheng Li,Yining Yin,Xiaofei Xie,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AtPatch, a hot-fix technique, dynamically redistributes attention maps in Transformer-based DNNs to mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mitigation strategies for anomalous attention patterns in DNNs—caused by backdoor attacks or unfairness—tend to be inflexible and distort feature representations, highlighting the need for a dynamic and minimally invasive solution.

Method: AtPatch dynamically modifies attention maps during inference by identifying anomalous columns using a pre-trained detector, replacing them with benign attention maps, and rescaling other columns. This process does not alter the model itself or require retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that AtPatch outperforms existing methods in mitigating backdoor attacks and unfairness while preserving the original functionality of Transformer-based DNNs.

Conclusion: AtPatch offers an effective, efficient, and minimally invasive solution to redistribute attention maps dynamically, making it suitable for deployed models while addressing issues of backdoor attacks and fairness in Transformer-based DNNs.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) affected by backdoor attacks and unfairness typically exhibit anomalous attention patterns, leading to over-attend to backdoor triggers or protected attributes. Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a tool and method to automatically migrate FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension (Esope) to Fortran 2008 using model-driven engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Migrating legacy programming languages like FORTRAN 77 to modern standards is difficult due to proprietary extensions and outdated semantics, making tools for this process vital.

Method: The paper introduces a tool leveraging model-driven engineering to transform Esope source code into easy-to-read Fortran 2008 while preserving abstraction levels.

Result: The developed tool successfully supports readability, abstraction maintenance, and scalability when migrating from Esope to the Fortran 2008 standard.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates modernization of legacy FORTRAN with proprietary extensions, offering a scalable and adaptable solution while addressing readability and abstraction challenges.

Abstract: Legacy programming languages such as FORTRAN 77 still play a vital role in many industrial applications. Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the imbalance caused by the rapid increase in paper submissions and the limited pool of qualified peer reviewers in Software Engineering.

Method: Presents a vision for a more scalable and inclusive peer review system with strategies for attracting newcomers, incentivizing participants, and leveraging AI tools responsibly.

Result: Recommendations for enhancing the peer review system to make it scalable, inclusive, and resilient.

Conclusion: A reimagined peer review process can sustainably support the growth and quality of the Software Engineering research community.

Abstract: Peer review is the main mechanism by which the software engineering community assesses the quality of scientific results. However, the rapid growth of paper submissions in software engineering venues has outpaced the availability of qualified reviewers, creating a growing imbalance that risks constraining and negatively impacting the long-term growth of the Software Engineering (SE) research community. Our vision of the Future of the SE research landscape involves a more scalable, inclusive, and resilient peer review process that incorporates additional mechanisms for: 1) attracting and training newcomers to serve as high-quality reviewers, 2) incentivizing more community members to serve as peer reviewers, and 3) cautiously integrating AI tools to support a high-quality review process.

*Chantale Lauer,Peter Pfeiffer,Alexander Rombach,Nijat Mehdiyev*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEF4LLM, a framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in BPMN modeling based on quality dimensions, showing LLMs have strengths in specific areas but face challenges in semantic aspects and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated BPMN models and explore their potential compared to human experts.

Method: BEF4LLM, a four-perspective evaluation framework, is developed and applied to assess syntactic, pragmatic, semantic quality, and validity of open-source LLMs against human modeling experts.

Result: LLMs perform competitively in syntactic and pragmatic quality but lag behind humans in semantic and validity aspects, with relatively modest score differences.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in BPMN modeling, but improvement in validity and semantic quality is crucial for practical application and deployment.

Abstract: The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies folklore in software engineering, analyzing myths, narratives, and informal knowledge in the field through thematic analysis and interviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how informal narratives and cultural heuristics in software environments influence engineering practices and collective knowledge.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review, thematic analysis, and semi-structured interviews with 12 Swedish practitioners to explore folklore items and their occupational impact.

Result: The study identified key folklore elements in software engineering, analyzed their forms and implications, and synthesized them into a comprehensive definition of software engineering folklore.

Conclusion: Understanding and spotlighting software engineering folklore offers a basis for future studies and practices aimed at retaining helpful heuristics while reevaluating harmful narratives.

Abstract: We explore the concept of folklore within software engineering, drawing from folklore studies to define and characterize narratives, myths, rituals, humor, and informal knowledge that circulate within software development communities. Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.

*Yifeng Ding,Lingming Zhang*

TL;DR: SWE-Replay optimizes test-time scaling for Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering tasks by reusing prior trajectories efficiently, reducing costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs associated with test-time scaling for LLM agents in software engineering and overcome the limitations of existing methods relying on model calibration and value agents.

Method: The paper introduces SWE-Replay, a technique that dynamically balances between exploring new trajectories and exploiting previously archived ones by identifying critical intermediate steps. It does this without relying on externally-calculated value estimates.

Result: SWE-Replay reduces costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or improving task performance by up to 3.8%, as shown through evaluations on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: SWE-Replay is an effective and generalizable test-time scaling approach for modern software engineering agents, offering cost-efficiency and robustness without dependency on external value predictions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

### [323] [Differential Dynamic Causal Nets: Model Construction, Identification and Group Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21478)
*Kang You,Gary Green,Jian Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to construct differential causal networks from EEG data to model complex brain system interactions, focusing on dynamic causality in epilepsy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in constructing pathophysiological brain models across scales, particularly in studying interactions of neuronal circuits for group-level comparisons.

Method: A differential causal network is developed using parameterized local neural systems. Parameters are inferred using a novel evolutionary optimization algorithm based on Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations.

Result: The method fits coupled Jansen-Rit local models and is validated on synthetic and real EEG data. It identifies functional disruptions in brain networks during epileptic activity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively models brain system dynamics and identifies critical network disruptions, providing insights into pathological conditions such as epilepsy.

Abstract: Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.

*Johannes Bertram,Luciano Dyballa,Anderson Keller,Savik Kinger,Steven W. Zucker*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study analyzes the internal mechanisms of a state-of-the-art neural foundation model for understanding brain-like processes, focusing on its temporal response properties and representational structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to probe the inner workings of neural foundation models to bridge the gap between their functional performance and the understanding of brain-like processes.

Method: The authors characterize each artificial neuron by temporal response properties, build decoding and neural encoding manifolds, and employ a 'tubularity' metric to assess biological plausibility. They focus on analyzing the model's encoder, recurrent, and readout modules.

Result: The recurrent module was found to enhance representation quality by better separating temporal stimulus patterns, while the readout module achieves high fidelity but lacks biological plausibility in its mechanism.

Conclusion: The study reveals insights into a neural foundation model's representational structures, suggesting design changes such as early-stage recurrence introduction and constrained features for biological alignment.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent-IMH, a Bayesian posterior sampling method for computationally expensive linear inverse problems, showing improved efficiency over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions in computationally expensive linear inverse problems.

Method: Developing the Latent-IMH method which utilizes an approximate operator in an offline phase and refines latent variables with the exact operator.

Result: Latent-IMH demonstrated theoretical guarantees (KL divergence, mixing time bounds) and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art sampling methods (e.g., NUTS) in efficiency.

Conclusion: Latent-IMH is a scalable and computationally effective method for Bayesian linear inverse problems, significantly enhancing sampling efficiency.

Abstract: We study sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian linear inverse problems where $A$, the parameters to observables operator, is computationally expensive. In many applications, $A$ can be factored in a manner that facilitates the construction of a cost-effective approximation $\tilde{A}$. In this framework, we introduce Latent-IMH, a sampling method based on the Metropolis-Hastings independence (IMH) sampler. Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency. In some cases, Latent-IMH can be orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces VISTA, a framework that simplifies causal structure learning in high-dimensional settings by breaking the task into local subgraph learning and utilizing a voting-based mechanism for global integration. It ensures efficiency, acyclicity, and consistent improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal structure learning methods face computational difficulties in high-dimensional data due to the exponential growth of the search space and requirements for significant computational resources.

Method: VISTA uses Markov Blankets for local subgraph decomposition and combines them globally using weighted voting, penalizing low-support edges and filtering unreliable ones, while ensuring acyclic structures. It is model-agnostic, supports parallelization, and is compatible across diverse data settings.

Result: The framework demonstrates higher accuracy and efficiency in experiments with both synthetic and real datasets, providing consistent performance improvements across multiple base learners.

Conclusion: VISTA addresses scalability issues in causal structure learning by providing a modular framework that is effective, adaptive, and versatile in diverse settings, showing both theoretical performance guarantees and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Learning causal structures from observational data remains a fundamental yet computationally intensive task, particularly in high-dimensional settings where existing methods face challenges such as the super-exponential growth of the search space and increasing computational demands. To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF), a method to improve energy-based models (EBMs) for generative tasks by reformulating learning as a classification problem and combining it with score-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing training methods for energy-based models (EBMs), such as computational inefficiency in maximum likelihood and mode blindness in score matching.

Method: The proposed DiffCLF method reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification task across noise levels, making it computationally efficient and effective for learning. It integrates with standard score-based objectives.

Result: Experiments validate DiffCLF by comparing estimated energies to ground-truth data and applying it to tasks like model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling, showing improvements in fidelity and applicability.

Conclusion: DiffCLF provides a practical and effective way to train EBMs, overcoming challenges with existing methods while enabling broader use cases and higher model fidelity.

Abstract: Score-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable success. While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling. Our results show that DiffCLF enables EBMs with higher fidelity and broader applicability than existing approaches.

*Louis Grenioux,Maxence Noble*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines using diffusion models (DMs) as backbones for annealed Monte Carlo-based Boltzmann Generators (BGs), focusing on overcoming challenges in sampling thermodynamic equilibrium configurations for statistical physics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current BGs that rely on tractable likelihoods and perform poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets, by exploring the incorporation of diffusion models into annealed Monte Carlo-based frameworks.

Method: The paper performs an empirical analysis using controlled settings of multi-modal Gaussian mixtures to study the performance of DM-based aMC-BGs by comparing perfect and learned diffusion models.

Result: Second-order denoising kernels significantly improve sampling performance compared to first-order kernels if covariance information is available. Deterministic integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs further enhances performance but at a higher computational cost. However, when using learned DMs, accuracy suffers due to challenges in log-density estimation.

Conclusion: While DM-based aMC-BGs show promise in theoretical settings, their practical effectiveness is hindered by the difficulty of accurately estimating log densities in learned diffusion models.

Abstract: Sampling configurations at thermodynamic equilibrium is a central challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost. Finally, in the learned-DM setting, all DM-aMC variants struggle to produce accurate BGs; we trace the main bottleneck to inaccurate DM log-density estimation.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel machine learning method, the Penalized Profile SVM, designed for efficiently calculating failure probabilities in complex systems using an adaptive sampling strategy and a locally linear surrogate model.

Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently estimate the probability of failure for complex systems without extensive computational resource usage, while ensuring the geometry of the decision boundary is accurately captured.

Method: The authors propose the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine using the Gabriel edited set. This method incorporates an adaptive sampling strategy to focus on the boundary determining failure and creates a locally linear surrogate boundary with strategic clustering of training points.

Result: The method's performance is compared against other state-of-the-art classifiers on four test problems and is applied in determining survival probabilities in the Lotka-Volterra model. Two convergence results are proved to support the method's reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in estimating failure probabilities with minimal computational cost while maintaining accurate boundary representation. It demonstrates strong performance and practical applicability in modeling complex systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method called the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine based on the Gabriel edited set for the computation of the probability of failure for a complex system as determined by a threshold condition on a computer model of system behavior. The method is designed to minimize the number of evaluations of the computer model while preserving the geometry of the decision boundary that determines the probability. It employs an adaptive sampling strategy designed to strategically allocate points near the boundary determining failure and builds a locally linear surrogate boundary that remains consistent with its geometry by strategic clustering of training points. We prove two convergence results and we compare the performance of the method against a number of state of the art classification methods on four test problems. We also apply the method to determine the probability of survival using the Lotka--Volterra model for competing species.

Method: The authors employ asymptotic analysis by leveraging a dynamical mean-field framework and scalar Poisson jump processes to characterize SGD dynamics. They additionally provide a diffusion approximation using the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME).

Result: The study demonstrates that SGD shows consistent limiting dynamics across various sub-linear batch size scalings, but differs fundamentally in behavior compared to SME and gradient flow. Special cases of these distinctions, such as linear models or online SGD, are also addressed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that high-dimensional SGD dynamics are dictated by batch size and learning rate scaling, providing distinct insights into the behavior of SGD, SME, and gradient flow in data-intensive regimes.

Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $κ\asymp n^α$ where $α\in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $α\in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.

### [331] [Multilevel and Sequential Monte Carlo for Training-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21104)
*Aidan Gleich,Scott C. Schmidler*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free guidance technique for conditional generation in diffusion models using a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework with variance reduction methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional generation methods for diffusion models rely on biased point-estimation, which fails to capture the multimodal nature of the reverse diffusion process. The researchers aim to address this limitation and improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose an SMC framework to create an unbiased estimator of the posterior score by integrating over the full denoising distribution, enhanced with a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) for variance reduction.

Result: The method achieves 95.6% accuracy with three times lower cost-per-success compared to prior baselines on CIFAR-10 and a 1.5 times improvement in cost-per-success on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC framework sets a new benchmark for training-free conditional generation, combining accuracy and computational efficiency on tasks like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate, training-free guidance for conditional generation in trained diffusion models. Existing methods typically rely on point-estimates to approximate the posterior score, often resulting in biased approximations that fail to capture multimodality inherent to the reverse process of diffusion models. We propose a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework that constructs an unbiased estimator of $p_θ(y|x_t)$ by integrating over the full denoising distribution via Monte Carlo approximation. To ensure computational tractability, we incorporate variance-reduction schemes based on Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC). Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for training-free guidance on CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, achieving $95.6\%$ accuracy with $3\times$ lower cost-per-success than baselines. On ImageNet, our algorithm achieves $1.5\times$ cost-per-success advantage over existing methods.

### [332] [Provably Reliable Classifier Guidance through Cross-entropy Error Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21200)
*Sharan Sahu,Arisina Banerjee,Yuchen Wu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classifier-guided diffusion models with a focus on understanding their alignment during conditional sampling. It establishes conditions under which classifier training correlates with effective diffusion guidance and highlights the importance of classifier smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in understanding whether standard classifier training methods are suitable for effective diffusion guidance and to establish a quantitative relationship between classifier training and guidance performance.

Method: The authors analyze the smoothness and cross-entropy properties of classifiers. They derive mathematical bounds showing how controlling cross-entropy errors leads to consistent guidance vector accuracy under certain assumptions. They also construct counterexamples to illustrate the importance of classifier smoothness.

Result: The research shows that classifiers meeting specific smoothness and conditional KL divergence criteria induce guidance vectors with low error. It also highlights how failing smoothness assumptions can lead to ineffective diffusion guidance.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for the relationship between classifier training and guidance alignment in diffusion models. It emphasizes the necessity of smoothness in classifiers and offers guidance for classifier selection in related tasks.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of a learned classifier, yet it remains unclear whether standard classifier training procedures yield effective diffusion guidance. We address this gap by showing that, under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifiers, controlling the cross-entropy error at each diffusion step also controls the error of the resulting guidance vectors: classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ from the ground-truth conditional label probabilities induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde{O}(d \varepsilon )$. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error under classifier guidance and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev-type inequality. Moreover, we show that the classifier smoothness assumption is essential, by constructing simple counterexamples demonstrating that, without it, control of the guidance vector can fail for almost all distributions. To our knowledge, our work establishes the first quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment, yielding both a theoretical foundation for classifier guidance and principled guidelines for classifier selection.

TL;DR: Introduces an empirical Bayes approach using mean-field variational inference for Bayesian GLMs. Optimizes posterior mean and prior to simplify computation and achieve scalability. Demonstrates superior predictive performance for sparse logistic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible Bayesian approach for generalized linear models (GLMs) that eliminates tuning complexity and improves scalability and predictive accuracy.

Method: Employs mean-field variational inference (VI) to directly optimize posterior mean and prior parameters, with scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent.

Result: Demonstrates the model's effectiveness by achieving superior predictive performance in sparse logistic regression compared to prevailing methods.

Conclusion: Presents a unified, tuning-free VI framework suitable for various exponential families, offering computational advantages and broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce a flexible empirical Bayes approach for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models. Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free. Unlike traditional VI methods that optimize the posterior density function, our approach directly optimizes the posterior mean and prior parameters. This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches.

*Mengqi Chen,Thomas B. Berrett,Theodoros Damoulas,Michele Caprio*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets to tackle challenges in DRO with contamination, enabling finite objectives and efficient optimization schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DRO methods often fail with Huber contamination due to infinite risk unless using strong boundedness assumptions, necessitating alternative approaches.

Method: The approach learns a bulk set from data, separating contamination handling for high-mass bulk and tail contributions, enabling tractable optimization formulations.

Result: The framework delivers robust objectives with interpretable tolerance levels and competitive performance for diverse real-world applications, including inventory control and regression tasks.

Conclusion: Bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets resolve DRO pitfalls with contamination, providing robust and efficient tools for handling distributional shifts in various domains.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) minimises the worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set that can capture distributional shifts in out-of-sample environments. While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\mathrm{mean}+\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels. Experiments on heavy-tailed inventory control, geographically shifted house-price regression, and demographically shifted text classification show competitive robustness-accuracy trade-offs and efficient optimisation times, using Bayesian, frequentist, or empirical reference distributions.

*Erica Zhang,Naomi Sagan,Danny Tse,Fangzhao Zhang,Mert Pilanci,Jose Blanchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Statsformer is a framework that integrates LLM knowledge into supervised learning using a guardrailed ensemble method, ensuring robust performance even with misleading LLM guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods that either lack adaptability or are prone to errors from LLM hallucinations when integrating LLM-derived knowledge into statistical learning.

Method: A guardrailed ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners is used, where LLM-derived priors are adaptively calibrated using cross-validation, ensuring robust performance against statistical errors or incorrect guidance.

Result: The system consistently improves performance when LLM priors are informative, and it downweights uninformative or incorrect guidance, reducing the impact of hallucinations.

Conclusion: Statsformer demonstrates the potential to reliably incorporate LLM-derived knowledge into statistical models without being hindered by errors or limitations of LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.

*Yizhou Min,Yizhou Lu,Lanqi Li,Zhen Zhang,Jiaye Teng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper critiques standard metrics used in Conformal Prediction for uncertainty quantification and reveals vulnerabilities introduced by the 'Prejudicial Trick' (PT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics (coverage and interval length) in CP and raise awareness of deceptive practices like PT that maintain coverage but reduce interpretability.

Method: They critically analyze PT's mechanism, derive formal conditions for its operation, introduce a novel metric called interval stability, and validate findings via empirical studies on regression and classification tasks.

Result: The study reveals that PT can manipulate interval length without violating marginal coverage but produces instability in prediction intervals across runs.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for complementary metrics such as interval stability to ensure fairness and robustness in evaluating CP methods.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has become a cornerstone of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, conventionally evaluated by its coverage and interval length. This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques.

### [337] [A Decomposable Forward Process in Diffusion Models for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21812)
*Francisco Caldas,Sahil Kumar,Cláudia Soares*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new spectral-component-based diffusion process aimed at improving time-series forecasting by focusing on dominant temporal patterns and preserving long-term signal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in traditional diffusion methods for time-series forecasting, which often fail to effectively maintain structured temporal patterns such as seasonality.

Method: The proposed method introduces a forward diffusion process that decomposes signals into spectral components. Noise is staged based on component energy, retaining high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies, without altering the network architecture.

Result: The proposed process improves forecast quality across standard benchmarks by better preserving long-term patterns when compared to baseline forward processes. This enhancement comes with negligible additional computational cost.

Conclusion: The spectral decomposition strategy is adaptable to existing diffusion backbones, enhances long-term pattern recoverability, and provides better forecasting results without significant computational trade-offs.

Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

### [338] [A Judge-Aware Ranking Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21817)
*Mingyuan Xu,Xinzi Tan,Jiawei Wu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a judge-aware ranking framework for consistent and reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) that accounts for differences in judge reliability, achieving strong agreement with human preferences and providing accurate uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When evaluating LLMs on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels, traditional evaluation methods fail to account for the varying reliability of judge LLMs. Ignoring these differences can lead to biased rankings, confidence mismeasurements, and misguided conclusions.

Method: The authors propose a judge-aware ranking framework using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model extended with judge-specific discrimination parameters to account for variability in judge reliability during pairwise comparisons. They provide theoretical guarantees and apply consistency and normality principles to enable accurate confidence intervals for rankings.

Result: The proposed method improves ranking accuracy with better alignment to human preferences, requires fewer data compared to unweighted baselines, and delivers calibrated uncertainty measures. Experimental validations include multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of judge-aware evaluation provides a more reliable and data-efficient framework for ranking LLMs, helping to produce fairer and more interpretable evaluations with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.

*Daniel Gonzalez-Alvarado,Jonas Cassel,Stefania Petra,Christoph Schnörr*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes using latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorical distributions for generating models of discrete data efficiently and effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for better generative models for discrete data by reducing statistical dependencies and redundant dimensions among categorical variables.

Method: They introduce a Riemannian geometry to the parameter domain, enabling consistent flow matching while simplifying geodesics into straight lines for effective model training.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that generative models with reduced latent dimensions can effectively represent discrete data.

Conclusion: Reduced latent dimensions, combined with the proposed geometric structure, improve generative modeling of discrete data while simplifying training processes via flow matching.

Abstract: We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and ensure the stability and long-term behavior of score-based generative models, which are crucial in modern machine learning.

Method: The authors leverage Lyapunov drift and Doeblin-type minorization conditions under weak assumptions to study the reverse-time dynamics of generative models.

Result: Quantitative error bounds, ensuring stability and contracting behaviors in the reverse diffusion process, are presented.

Conclusion: The study provides a principled framework to analyze error propagation in score-based generative models, shedding light on the role of stochastic dynamics in these approaches.

Abstract: Understanding the stability and long-time behavior of generative models is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning. This paper provides quantitative bounds on the sampling error of score-based generative models by leveraging stability and forgetting properties of the Markov chain associated with the reverse-time dynamics. Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches.

*Lev Fedorov,Michaël E. Sander,Romuald Elie,Pierre Marion,Mathieu Laurière*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of random initialization noise in Transformers and offers a stochastic mechanics view, deviating from previous deterministic clustering theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theories of Transformers predict token clustering, but these rely on deterministic weights, which do not align with standard initialization schemes. This paper seeks to address this theoretical gap by exploring stochastic effects within token dynamics.

Method: The authors analyze deep Transformer models with noise derived from random initialization of value matrices under diffusion scaling and RMS normalization. They employ mathematical proofs and numerical experiments to assess token dynamics.

Result: The authors demonstrate that random initialization noise prevents token collapse into a single cluster and leads to a multi-cluster particle system on a sphere. A phase transition is shown for token dynamics under certain conditions, with antipodal formations emerging as stable configurations.

Conclusion: Random initialization noise plays a critical role in Transformer token dynamics, preventing clustering and enhancing performance stability. Suppressing intrinsic noise degrades accuracy, highlighting its importance.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based sampling method that smoothly integrates a base and a target distribution for more efficient sampling from complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of sampling from target distributions defined only up to a normalising constant, using insights from diffusion models for smooth transitions and efficient estimation.

Method: The authors propose diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo as a practical diffusion-based sampler, using sequential Monte Carlo for score estimation and employing control variates to minimize variance.

Result: The method achieves effective performance on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, backed by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust and efficient framework for sampling from complex distributions, leveraging diffusion paths and principled score estimates.

Abstract: We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Gaussian differential privacy testing procedure that balances optimality, efficiency, and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to design private statistical testing methods that achieve high efficiency while maintaining differential privacy and stringent error controls.

Method: A mechanism based on a private mean estimator with adaptive clamping bounds is introduced, ensuring optimal performance. Private test statistics are constructed to align with non-private tests' asymptotic efficiency and strict type I error control.

Result: The proposed private tests showed superior performance compared to existing DP methods, matching the efficiency of non-private tests even at small sample sizes and low privacy budgets.

Conclusion: This framework successfully integrates differential privacy with near-optimal statistical efficiency, offering practical and effective private testing solutions.

Abstract: We develop a near-optimal testing procedure under the framework of Gaussian differential privacy for simple as well as one- and two-sided tests under monotone likelihood ratio conditions. Our mechanism is based on a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, whose population risk matches the private minimax rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers to optimize functions with intractable gradients, reducing computational costs and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for optimizing functions with inaccessible gradients are computationally expensive due to the use of inner sampling loops for stochastic gradient estimation.

Method: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers replace costly inner sampling techniques, offering more efficient approximations for function optimization.

Result: Convergence results were established for the SMC-based methodology, and its effectiveness was demonstrated in optimizing energy-based models under various settings.

Conclusion: The approach of utilizing SMC samplers significantly reduces computational expenses while maintaining optimization effectiveness in problems with intractable gradients.

Abstract: The problem of optimising functions with intractable gradients frequently arise in machine learning and statistics, ranging from maximum marginal likelihood estimation procedures to fine-tuning of generative models. Stochastic approximation methods for this class of problems typically require inner sampling loops to obtain (biased) stochastic gradient estimates, which rapidly becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we develop sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers for optimisation of functions with intractable gradients. Our approach replaces expensive inner sampling methods with efficient SMC approximations, which can result in significant computational gains. We establish convergence results for the basic recursions defined by our methodology which SMC samplers approximate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the reward-tuning of energy-based models within various settings.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMD-k, a hierarchy of distance metrics for quantum ensembles, showing trade-offs between discriminative power and statistical efficiency, comparing it to quantum Wasserstein distance, and applying it to quantum denoising models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distance metrics are key in machine learning, but understanding them for quantum ensembles remains a challenge due to quantum measurements' limitations.

Method: The authors propose MMD-k, a generalization of maximum mean discrepancy, analyze its trade-offs with statistical efficiency, and compare it with quantum Wasserstein distance. They also validate through quantum denoising models.

Result: They find that MMD-k requires Θ(N^{2−2/k}) samples for constant k, and Θ(N^3) for full discriminative power. In contrast, quantum Wasserstein only needs Θ(N^2 log N) samples for full discriminative power.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into designing loss functions for quantum machine learning and demonstrates their application to quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Android banking applications in East and Southeast Asia against advanced malware attacks like FjordPhantom.

Method: Conducted an empirical analysis of the vulnerability of banking apps, evaluated current protective measures, and proposed methods to detect vulnerabilities and mitigate attacks facilitated by FjordPhantom.

Result: The research identified vulnerabilities in existing banking apps exploited by FjordPhantom and assessed the limited effectiveness of current protective measures.

Conclusion: FjordPhantom represents a significant threat to financial security in the target regions. Strengthening app defenses through improved detection and mitigation techniques is urgently needed.

Abstract: Android banking applications have revolutionized financial management by allowing users to perform various financial activities through mobile devices. However, this convenience has attracted cybercriminals who exploit security vulnerabilities to access sensitive financial data. FjordPhantom, a malware identified by our industry collaborator, uses virtualization and hooking to bypass the detection of malicious accessibility services, allowing it to conduct keylogging, screen scraping, and unauthorized data access. This malware primarily affects banking and finance apps across East and Southeast Asia region where our industry partner's clients are primarily based in. It requires users to be deceived into installing a secondary malicious component and activating a malicious accessibility service. In our study, we conducted an empirical study on the susceptibility of banking apps in the region to FjordPhantom, analyzed the effectiveness of protective measures currently implemented in those apps, and discussed ways to detect and prevent such attacks by identifying and mitigating the vulnerabilities exploited by this malware.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper lies in addressing the challenge of state estimation for complex, model-free dynamical processes, particularly when traditional physics-based models for process evolution are unavailable.

Method: The authors propose the Variational State Estimation (VSE) method, which uses two RNNs—one for inference and the other for learning—combined through variational inference principles to produce a closed-form Gaussian posterior for nonlinear measurements.

Result: In a benchmark tracking task involving a stochastic Lorenz system, VSE demonstrated competitive performance against a particle filter (with prior system knowledge) and a recent data-driven state estimation approach.

Conclusion: The study concludes that VSE is a computationally efficient, accurate, and model-free approach for complex dynamical state estimation, offering strong performance in comparative applications.

Abstract: We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.

### [348] [Blind Ultrasound Image Enhancement via Self-Supervised Physics-Guided Degradation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21856)
*Shujaat Khan,Syed Muhammad Atif,Jaeyoung Huh,Syed Saad Azhar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework for ultrasound image enhancement that deconvolves and denoises images without relying on clean targets. The method outperforms existing techniques in various noise conditions, showing improved resolution and segmentation outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound image analysis faces challenges due to speckle noise, blur, and scanner/operator artifacts. Current enhancement techniques require clean targets, which are rarely available in practice.

Method: A Swin Convolutional U-Net is trained using a physics-guided degradation model. It uses synthesized inputs degraded with Gaussian PSF and noise perturbations, while clean-like targets for US scans are generated via non-local low-rank denoising.

Result: The method achieves superior PSNR and SSIM scores across different noise levels. It has reduced edge erosion and resolution recovery, and boosts segmentation accuracy when used as preprocessing.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical approach to robust ultrasound image enhancement that generalizes well across datasets, scanners, and different degradation types.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) interpretation is hampered by multiplicative speckle, acquisition blur from the point-spread function (PSF), and scanner- and operator-dependent artifacts. Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\sim$1--4\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\sim$2--5\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle. Controlled PSF studies show reduced FWHM and higher peak gradients, evidence of resolution recovery without edge erosion. Used as a plug-and-play preprocessor, it consistently boosts Dice for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation. Overall, the approach offers a practical, assumption-light path to robust US enhancement that generalizes across datasets, scanners, and degradation types.

*Alexandre Chaussard,Anna Bonnet,Sylvain Le Corff*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework combining regime-adaptive dynamics with Poisson log-normal emissions for analyzing temporal count data, with applications in disentangled representation learning and perturbation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the increasing need to model growing volumes of temporal count observations effectively, facilitating better understanding and interpretation of complex datasets.

Method: The framework uses independent component analysis with regime-adaptive dynamics and Poisson log-normal emissions, supported by an identifiability guarantee and an efficient amortized variational inference for parameter learning.

Result: This method demonstrates successful recovery of mixing functions and latent sources in simulated experiments and uncovers microbial co-variation patterns and regime shifts in real-world gut microbiome data.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for analyzing temporal count data, enabling principled representation learning and capturing meaningful regime-dependent dynamics.

Abstract: Advances in data collection are producing growing volumes of temporal count observations, making adapted modeling increasingly necessary. In this work, we introduce a generative framework for independent component analysis of temporal count data, combining regime-adaptive dynamics with Poisson log-normal emissions. The model identifies disentangled components with regime-dependent contributions, enabling representation learning and perturbations analysis. Notably, we establish the identifiability of the model, supporting principled interpretation. To learn the parameters, we propose an efficient amortized variational inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data evaluate recovery of the mixing function and latent sources across diverse settings, while an in vivo longitudinal gut microbiome study reveals microbial co-variation patterns and regime shifts consistent with clinical perturbations.

TL;DR: The paper develops a causal network of SDG dependencies using a novel framework and proposes a tiered priority framework to guide interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and understand the causal dependencies among SDGs to aid in efficient resource distribution and help achieve the 2030 SDGs.

Method: A causal discovery framework was applied using Panel Vector Autoregression, fixed effects, and PCMCI+ independence testing on data from 168 countries during 2000-2025.

Result: A distributed causal network without a keystone SDG was identified, with Education to Inequality being the most significant causal relationship. Relationships and their magnitude vary by income level.

Conclusion: Strategic, multi-dimensional approaches are more effective at accelerating SDG progress than single-goal sequential strategies.

Abstract: The achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is dependent upon strategic resource distribution. We propose a causal discovery framework using Panel Vector Autoregression, along with both country-specific fixed effects and PCMCI+ conditional independence testing on 168 countries (2000-2025) to develop the first complete causal architecture of SDG dependencies. Utilizing 8 strategically chosen SDGs, we identify a distributed causal network (i.e., no single 'hub' SDG), with 10 statistically significant Granger-causal relationships identified as 11 unique direct effects. Education to Inequality is identified as the most statistically significant direct relationship (r = -0.599; p < 0.05), while effect magnitude significantly varies depending on income levels (e.g., high-income: r = -0.65; lower-middle-income: r = -0.06; non-significant). We also reject the idea that there exists a single 'keystone' SDG. Additionally, we offer a proposed tiered priority framework for the SDGs namely, identifying upstream drivers (Education, Growth), enabling goals (Institutions, Energy), and downstream outcomes (Poverty, Health). Therefore, we conclude that effective SDG acceleration can be accomplished through coordinated multi-dimensional intervention(s), and that single-goal sequential strategies are insufficient.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the bigMICE package for efficient multi-valued missing data imputation in large datasets using Apache Spark, overcoming challenges in computational time and memory limitations with traditional MICE implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of biased or inefficient analyses due to missing data, especially in large medical registries, and aims to overcome the computational limitations of traditional MICE when applied to big datasets.

Method: The authors developed the bigMICE package, an adaptation of the MICE framework utilizing Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML, which controls memory usage and processes large datasets efficiently even on hardware with limited resources.

Result: Testing on a large Swedish medical registry showed that bigMICE is faster and more memory-efficient than traditional MICE, and it produces high-quality imputations even for variables with a high proportion of missing data.

Conclusion: bigMICE is a scalable and efficient solution for imputation in large datasets, providing an open-source tool and guidelines for its use, with improvements in memory efficiency and imputation quality for big-data environments.

Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations.
  To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops.
  The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.

*Augusto Fasano,Giovanni Rebaudo*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian variable selection method for binary outcomes using a probit model with spike-and-slab priors, applying a mean-field variational Bayes approach to achieve computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of computational inefficiency and scalability in high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection problems using MCMC samplers.

Method: The paper proposes a mean-field variational Bayes approximation with closed-form updates and develops a coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm for parameter estimation.

Result: The proposed method is significantly faster than MCMC in both simulated and real data applications, while maintaining comparable accuracy in identifying important variables.

Conclusion: This approach offers a fast, interpretable, and accurate framework for Bayesian variable selection and prediction, making it a practical alternative to traditional MCMC methods.

Abstract: We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

### [353] [A costing framework for fusion power plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21724)
*Simon Woodruff*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper details the evolution of a comprehensive cost analysis framework for fusion power plants developed from 2017 to 2024. It integrates early cost-scaling models to a robust, standardized methodology and documents the creation of an open-source tool (pyFECONs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable, refined, and auditable costing framework for fusion power plant technologies, supporting design and cost optimization for ARPA-E's fusion portfolio.

Method: The study evolved from cost-scaling relations and pilot studies to bottom-up subsystem modeling, incorporating physics-informed, engineering-constrained designs, and aligning with established standards (IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI).

Result: The framework evolved into the open-source tool pyFECONs, providing transparent cost estimation processes and standardized account alignments. It includes methodologies addressing detailed subsystem costs and cost-reduction strategies.

Conclusion: The efforts bridge engineering and economic aspects of fusion power generation, offering a valuable tool for fusion plant design optimization and aligning costs to standards, ensuring transparency and reliability in cost assessments.

Abstract: This paper summarizes and consolidates fusion power-plant costing work performed in support of ARPA-E from 2017 through 2024, and documents the evolution of the associated analysis framework from early capital-cost-focused studies to a standards-aligned, auditable costing capability. Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE.

*Shogo Nakakita*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper establishes sample complexity guarantees for estimating covariance matrices of certain distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), comparing single-chain and parallel implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of efficient and accurate estimation of covariance matrices for strongly log-concave smooth distributions, which is critical for many machine learning and statistical applications.

Method: They quantitatively study the sample complexity of single-chain ULA compared to parallel ULA, employing a log-Sobolev inequality to derive a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix.

Result: The single-chain ULA is shown to have a smaller sample complexity than the parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor, driven by effective bias reduction during the burn-in process.

Conclusion: Single-chain ULA is more sample-efficient than parallel ULA for covariance estimation, with theoretical guarantees derived from concentration bounds based on log-Sobolev inequalities.

Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of strongly log-concave smooth distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.

### [355] [Thompson sampling: Precise arm-pull dynamics and adaptive inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21131)
*Qiyang Han*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper examines the arm-pull dynamics of Thompson-sampling algorithms in multi-armed bandits, finding deterministic behavior for some arms and probabilistic dynamics for others. It also identifies key principles for stability and non-stability in these algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the stability and arm-pull dynamics of Thompson-sampling type algorithms and uncover their implications for statistical inference, addressing existing gaps in understanding adaptive sampling.

Method: The authors use analytical methods such as Stieltjes integrals and reparameterized SDEs, leveraging mathematical tools like the parabolic Hörmander condition and Stroock-Varadhan support theorem to characterize arm dynamics.

Result: They find that arm dynamics exhibit a dichotomy: deterministic behavior for suboptimal or single optimal arms, and probabilistic dynamics governed by invariant laws for other arms. This dichotomy is linked to stability and interaction with statistical noise.

Conclusion: The findings enable new ways to construct confidence intervals and design inference methods for both stable and unstable regimes, advancing our understanding of adaptive sampling and Thompson-sampling type algorithms.

Abstract: Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.
  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.
  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.
  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic Hörmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.

### [356] [Pathwise Learning of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21860)

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural path estimation approach for solving stochastic dynamical systems using variational inference while also addressing challenges of noisy, nonlinear observed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data that are noisy and indirectly observed, which is common in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce a method involving stochastic control and generative modeling. They solve the filtering posterior path measure using a pathwise Zakai equation and implement controlled diffusion to map the prior path measure to a posterior measure.

Result: The approach can successfully infer stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and conditional path measures from noisy observation data. It effectively models multimodal, chaotic, and high-dimensional systems in experimental settings.

Conclusion: The proposed neural path estimation method demonstrates the potential to improve the modeling of complex stochastic systems, overcoming the challenges of noise and nonlinear indirect observations.

Abstract: The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.

*Amir Ali Ahmadi,Georgina Hall*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper establishes the intractability of approximating critical points for certain nonconvex functions, linking the existence of such an efficient algorithm to proving P=NP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the commonly-held belief that computing approximate critical points in nonconvex optimization is a tractable problem by demonstrating its computational hardness.

Method: The authors derive and prove complexity-theoretic results, showing that even approximating critical points for low-degree polynomial functions in nonconvex settings leads to computational implications for P vs NP.

Result: They prove that if a polynomial-time algorithm could achieve such approximation under certain conditions, then P=NP, and they further explore hardness under additional structural constraints.

Conclusion: Contrary to popular assumptions, even coarse approximations of critical points in nonconvex optimization can be computationally hard, challenging the tractability view.

Abstract: We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.

TL;DR: An AI-driven decentralized framework is proposed for multi-agent mapping with adaptive mechanisms from optimal transport and neural networks, achieving improved environmental reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail under uncertain environmental priors, necessitating adaptive and self-correcting mechanisms for effective spatial mapping.

Method: Utilizes an optimal transport-based framework alongside AI modules (dual MLPs) for refining density estimates and regulating uncertainty in mapping processes.

Result: The framework aligns effectively with ground truth density, outperforming conventional decentralized approaches in reconstructing complex spatial distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures scalability, theoretical convergence, and high-fidelity environmental mapping in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-augmented decentralized framework for multi-agent (multi-robot) environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication. While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.
